A Republican Strategy for Combating the Reelection of Obama
The Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Centre considers it a myth, claiming that electoral fraud is rarer in the United States than the number of people killed by lightning.
In addition, Republican lawyers have identified only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively influence the participation rate.
In this regard, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
It is in this spirit that a majority of U.S. governments promulgated from 2009 new laws making the registration or voting process more difficult.
This phenomenon has increased after the November 2010 elections, which saw 675 new republican representatives in 26 States to be added.
Consequently, 180 draft laws restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 States were introduced during the year 2011 alone.
The new electoral laws require voters to present an identity card with photo and proof of American citizenship.
In addition, these laws also reduce periods of advance voting, invalidate the right to vote as an elector on the day of election and withdraw citizens with a legal case from their right to vote.
Before the 2006 elections, no U.S. State required voters to present an identity card with a photo.
Indiana was the first State to impose such a requirement.
The United States Supreme Court confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of Indian law.
The Republican authorities undertook to extend this practice to other States.
Over the past two years, they have sponsored bills in 34 states to force voters to submit an identity card with a photo.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, 21 million people of voting age, do not have photo ID cards issued by a government agency of their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such an identity.
However, it often costs more than a hundred dollars to get the required ID card.
New restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities, and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people earn less than $35,000; 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 do not have the required identity card with photo.
Much more.
Students, voters considered to be voting more for democratic candidates, are not allowed in several states to use their identity card with photo issued by their institution.
On the other hand, these same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who vote more on the republican side to use to vote on the cards issued by those clubs.
Prior to 2004, no State required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to present such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove that they are American citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Spanish vote.
However, it appears that two Hispanic electors out of three favor the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican legislators sponsored legislation in 2011 abolishing voter registration on polling day in eight States.
In addition, they limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters wishing to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, during the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns contributed to the registration of approximately 10 million citizens.
However, the measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the enrolment rate of new voters by 17% in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators have adopted laws in five other States aimed at reducing the period of advance voting.
For example, during the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of voters who voted in advance were African Americans, while the voters represented only 13% of the state voters.
It was the same with the Hispanics.
They represented only 11% of the voters, but 24% of the citizens who voted in advance.
On the other hand, 76% of voters represented only 46% of voters voting in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters strongly opposed the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
Several bills were blocked by the vetoes of democratic governors.
The U.S. Attorney General intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to partly limit the damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 States have adopted laws requiring the presentation of an identity card with photo.
However, the new rules put in place will undoubtedly make the exercise of the right to vote more difficult in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been passed and see it as a clear objective of influencing the results in 2012 in key states.
A report by the Brennan Centre of 2011 shows that the States that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes needed by the electoral college to win the presidency.
It is too early to assert with certainty that these legislative changes at the electoral system level will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively influence the participation rate.
In this regard, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate cancer screening: pass the test or not?
Indeed, the APS test would sometimes present incorrect results, with false negative or false positive results, which result in unnecessary medical interventions.
What makes men already reluctant to pass screening tests even more hesitant.
Pass the test or not?
We requested the opinion of two specialists.
In the studies conducted in the United States, there was a lot of contamination among the control groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and have firm recommendations.
Another study, the European one, concluded a difference in mortality between patients who had a screening and those who had not.
This study also demonstrated, with a follow-up after 12 years, that between 30 and 40% more chances of having metastases if not detected.
I therefore recommend the test from 50 years old, or from 40 years old if we have a direct relative who has already had prostate cancer.
Men of African-American origin are also at greater risk.
The key is to make the right decision once cancer has been detected.
There are aggressive and other cancers that are indolent.
It is really necessary to make the patient understand the degree of risk of his cancer, offering him the options possible, not necessarily treating prostate cancers that do not affect long-term life, and instead opting, in such cases, for active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many people in whom cancer is detected will not be treated, because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
They will be suggested to be actively monitored and if the disease progresses, they will be offered treatment.
More and more, the criteria for deciding which should or should not be addressed are being clearly identified.
I therefore recommend that you pass the test.
But the important thing is to have a discussion with your doctor about whether we should pass it or not.
In collaboration with the International Urology Society, Movember created a tool to assess the for and against the APS test.

Preventing disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of research, the adoption of good living habits remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering.
It is estimated that if everyone ate well and moved well enough, 30% of cancer could be prevented.
"If no one else smoked, this rate would rise to at least 50%," said André Beaulieu, spokesperson for the Canadian Cancer Society.
On the other hand, it is estimated that approximately 10% of cancers are caused by inheritance.
Several remain completely unexplained as well.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority, despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Cigarette is related to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for several others.
This has a huge impact on people's health.
"There are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today," laments spokesperson André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after smoking is abandoned, the risk of dying of half a cancer falls.
Weight
Embonpoint and obesity also promote the onset of the disease, according to the CSC.
They would increase the risk of breast, colon and rectum cancer, oesophagus, pancreas and uterus.
"Research shows that the regular practice of physical activity throughout a lifetime protects against colon cancer," we added.
Feeding
The organization also recommends limiting its consumption of red meat.
Too much, it increases the risk of colorectal cancer.
Charcuteries too, and they should be avoided.
The conservation of meat by smoking, drying or salaison may result in the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"The latter can damage the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer," we explained.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the linkages between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their research is not conclusive at the moment.
Vitamin E studies are contradictory, according to CSC.
While one observed a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, another noted an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clearly established either.
Furthermore, Mr Beaulieu stressed the importance of talking about his concerns and family history with his doctor.
"Take a screening test, it doesn't give cancer."
Higgs boson's decoyed
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson created an entire emo, last summer, and because.
It is believed that this boson participates in the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the universe, nothing but that.
And then it is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model - our best, or "less worse" explanation of the nature and behaviour of the matter - but which has not yet been empirically observed.
But for physicists, it's not yet completely certain that it's about Higgs.
We know without any doubt that we hold an authentic new particle, and that it looks much like the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, new data revealed this week at a large physics conference in Kyoto seem to confirm this, but still lacks data to be perfectly certain of it.
Let's suppose it's about Higgs, because the chances of cheating seem thin, and let's see what it's all about.
There is, in this low world, a fatally inevitable law that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
No way to break this rule - and don't try too hard, you're going to hurt yourself.
But even though the physics of particles is a very strange world, it turns out that it also has such a law: Pauli's principle of exclusion, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantic state" - this "state" consisting of gross mode in some of their characteristics.
Hence, physicists classify particles into two categories.
In one area, there are good citizens named farms, who wisely obey Pauli's principle.
And in the other are bosons, a dirty band of anarchists who have no respect for anything - in any case, not for this principle, which means that they can actually be in the same place, at the same time.
These bosons are then divided into two groups, according to the site (absolutely extraordinary, moreover) The Particle Adventure, Berkeley Laboratories: the messons, which we will not approach here, and the "particles of force", by which the great forces of nature spread and to which the boson of Higgs would somehow be related.
These bosons, it must be stressed here, are not all as exotic beasts as one might believe.
In fact, if you can read this chronicle, it is thanks to a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon, or the "particle of light" that is the "messier" of electromagnetic force.
When, in fact, a particle with an electrical charge speeds up or changes direction, this "diseases" the electromagnetic field in this precise place, a bit like a pebble thrown into a pond.
From this "disease" is born an electromagnetic wave (light, or infrared, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon - and therefore, one of the bosons "bearers of force".
More stable field
The same goes for the Higgs boson, to this difference that it is another field, the Higgs field, which must be "disturbed" for this boson to appear.
However, this field of Higgs is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, you have to reach very, very high energies, a little as if it were a frozen pond whose only a very large rock could ride the surface.
That's why we need a huge particle accelerator like CERN's - the Large Hadron Collider is a 27 km ring of circumference! - to achieve such energies.
Analogue with electromagnetic field is again useful to explain the relationship between Higgs and mass.
Not all particles, not all materials, interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do it, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never have it on a fridge.
And in the same way, it is not all the particles that interact with the Higgs field: those that do it have a mass, while the others (like the photon, you have) do not.
Now, what "can I bring" all these researches, asks Mrs. Plamondon?
For science, this is used to verify the validity of the Standard Model (MS), and it also allows physicists to scrutinize any gap between observations and predictions of the MS.
They are also many who wish they could be found, because the slightest difference could open a door on a "new physical" and block some holes in the Model.
The latter, it must be said, still has enormous deficiencies, offering no explanation for gravity (ops!) or dark matter, which forms about 80% of the matter of the Universe (re-ops!).
But no such deviations have been found at the CERN so far.
Impacts
The impact of these research on the daily lives of Mr and Mrs. Tout-Monde, they are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will not be.
Keep in mind: At the beginning of the 1960s, laser pioneers in Bell Laboratories did not suspect the revolution that their work would trigger.
They asked about scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, we have already said fire the physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the first ones were pulsed), in 1962 -, initially the laser was seen as a "labo gadget".
Imagine...
And then, applications can also come from all the instruments around the search.
For example, this same Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969 during his optical work.
This sensor, although not at all its original intention, now serves as an "eye" for all digital cameras in the world, and has earned it the Nobel Prize in Physics 2009.
This does not mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC will necessarily transform our lives, but it means that, really, we never know...
Palliative care - The best way to die... . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
With its Commission dying in dignity, Quebec has recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate should be resumed shortly as a bill is being prepared.
In this vital area, however, much remains to be done.
Duty tried to look closer.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. still lived alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The cancer of the prostate that snorted him had left him a two-year repetition.
"They had given me five years to live, I've been seven years," he said, half-fig half-root, lying in his bed at the palliative care house Victor-Gadbois, from Beloeil, where he arrived the night before.
"But it's always a shock, we can't be prepared for it," he says.
The disease does its work: a huge weakness that prevents it from going to the toilet alone, and even eating alone.
Attached to a tasty lunch, he agrees to let himself be helped to eat, signed.
Courageous, he even smiles, talks to the strangers who deal with him, bring him his medication, offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is to be cured of diarrhea, it's humiliating," he confides.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this disease.
"During our lifetime, we learn that a man, he pisses on his feet," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at Victor-Gadbois' house.
Returning to the stage of the child, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
"It depends on the person's ability to accept regression," he says.
Because, in the opinion of several people working in palliative care, great moments occur at the very heart of this regression.
Patients entering the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home all suffer from cancer.
They have a life forecast of up to three months.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer provides so-called "curative" care.
For Ms. A., 89, the worst fear is to die " conscious and choked " .
But the disease made me discover my children.
"I have good kids," she adds.
"I don't have any more wishes in life," she says, before accepting a mask to help her breathe.
She still looks forward to a final visit of her son from Italy in the coming days.
At Victor-Gadbois, we are working with a group of volunteers, body care and food aid.
It is palliative care that is given when there is nothing else to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is a bed of palliative care for 11,700 inhabitants.
It's very little when we know we all end up dying one day.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors in the house.
Whether it is physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
By dying, you will agree to provide oral care to brandy or Pepsi, as requested.
Diabetes will no longer be required to control their sugar rate.
And death is part of the daily life.
Last night, we served a beer to Mr. X, who died during the night.
This morning, it's his son who will finish the beer at the foot of the deceased.
"We help both relatives and patients," says Nathalie Savard, Director of Care.
At Victor-Gadbois' house, the days follow but don't look like them.
Along with a 93-year-old man who enjoys his last family assembly in the court, well placed in his pillows while breaking in his honor, a young man aged 36 dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two young children, after having tried everything to survive.
"For six months, there have always been three to five beds occupied by cancer patients under 45 years of age," concerns Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients admitted to the Victor-Gadbois house come from their home, 47% come from the hospital.
Access to palliative care problem
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient has reached the terminal stage of his life, whether at home, in the hospital or in the home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois House and the Grand Montréal Home Palliative Care Society, specialize more or less exclusively in the care offered to cancer patients.
It is precisely this great deficiency in Quebec's health care that creates fear for a number of medical specialists in palliative care that a law on euthanasia and assisted suicide is adopted.
Since October, a manifesto, signed by members of palliative care, which Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe have been circulating to testify to their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not performing enough to ensure that everyone will be entitled to quality palliative care before euthanasia is accepted.
Recently, she said, I saw a patient spend 14 days in emergency, in great pain, without doing what is necessary to relieve her.
I'm afraid patients are only asking to die because they don't get adequate care.
And at the same time, several oncologists are tending on their patients until the last day, despite the worst predictions.
Helene Richard's survival hopes were already minimal when she gave up a proven chemotherapy.
When I told my colleague that I was stopping treatment, she said that she was sorry that I stopped fighting, she told me.
Yet she told me that I was finished!
No all-powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who claim to die thank the caregivers for not having responded to their request after they have been relieved of their pain by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Grand Montréal Home Palliative Care Society, patients would be refractory to pain treatments in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, which falls asleep until death, either sporadicly or permanently.
We can no longer pretend not to hear that part of suffering.
More and more, the unresolved patient will have the opportunity to have this palliative sedation.
Patients who are not relieved always say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want you to euthanize me," that means "I want to be relieved".
The realization of this reporting was made possible through a Journalism Fellowship of the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Road officials, BTP entrepreneurs, political party fund collectors and specialists from the Italian mafia tell day by day what they know of a formidable "system", mixing building industry, civil servants, politicians, unionists and mafioso.
A "industry " that cost Quebec taxpayers dearly, especially in the 1990s and 2000.
"It's funny how the system has been chilling since we took the great means," ironic Jacques Duchesneau, Member of Parliament in Quebec and former Chief of Police of Montreal.
It was through him that the scandal broke out in 2011 through a substantive investigation into misdemeanours related to road works contracts in Quebec, to which the Liberal Prime Minister of the time, Jean Charest, had only agreed to withdraw.
The "Duchesneau report" established a direct link between industry, hidden party funding and civil servants corruption.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he pointed out that the only Ministry of Transport would have saved $1 billion on contracts," some of them referring their instincts to pay a share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already dropped two mayors", he adds, hoping that it will "demonstrate the stratagems behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit created in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, also stands there with its army of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
More than the police officers of the "Marteau Squad" that, since 2009, would have led the Montreal "cartel des sewers" to put the sweet pedal on the inflated contracts...
In recent weeks, she has carried out serial searches and filed charges for fraud and corruption against municipal elected officials such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburban city.
Next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who just resigned from his position as mayor of Laval, the third city of Quebec.
He is suspected of imputing repeatable wine pots in exchange for public contracts.
They are also formally accused of engineers on the road to Montreal and of entrepreneurs of Italian origin, including Tony Accuro and Lino Zambio.
The latter made sense by explaining to the commission the mechanics of the "system" of obtaining public contracts.
For years he himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediary related to the mafia who was reversing the money to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gerald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambiba sowed all winds in the 2000s, giving more than $88,000 (about €68,000) to provincial parties, especially Liberals then in power.
He also admitted that he had organized an illegal fund-raising for former Liberal Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewage contracts that increased costs
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked roundly.
Gilles Surprising, former public works engineer, detailed it well before the commission: in ten years, he received gift construction companies, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and wine pots, in exchange for sewerage contracts, which increased costs.
Other road officials admitted to having fattening their feet by inflating the invoices from 30% to 40% by false extras.
Then an organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately closing his eyes on a parallel budget feeding his money boxes with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned early November, diving Montreal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montreal's first elected to shoot the alarm bell.
Mayor of the district of Rivière-des-Prairies, east of the island, has been rising since 2010 against the sale of a municipal land purchased $5 million and resold... 1.6 million to promoters, in full real estate boom.
70% of dirty money in electoral campaigns
From the investigation that will eventually be put in place, she says that she "shoots on a wire to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop gangrene and stab the faults".
The process, she says, is "painful but positive".
We are cleaning up the wound, but it would require a unit of investigation specific to Montreal and a precaution, in order not to see the questionable practices come back.
Like we do the housekeeping.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes that "ministers have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars," but he is particularly concerned about the role of "elect in the knowledge of the stratagem", when they did not dive in the jaw!
Estimated to 70% of the share of dirty money in the funding of electoral campaigns in Quebec, he ironicized: "I was told it was only a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to parties to $100, but this will not change the amount, he said, "So long as electoral expenses are not strictly limited, there will be dirty money in politics."
He advocates a complete revision of the system of government contracts and party financing: "We cannot go down; going to the bottom of things, with courage, will enable us to rebuild the house on stronger foundations, with more controls and laws."
If this story terried the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invited those who laughed at it to look at it in their own courtyard...
"The PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
This season, you took on a new scale with the PSG.
How do you explain this progression?
It can be explained by an individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of the GSP.
Great players have arrived.
Every day, I make progress with them.
The technical staff also brought me a lot.
Every day, these elements move me to raise my level of play.
And in the game, it's easier.
Everything's going very fast on the football.
But I'm not on fire.
From my beginnings at the INF Clairefontaine's preformation center to my passage to Saint-Etienne, I have always advanced by levels.
You will therefore benefit from the competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti...
This summer's recruits are used to fighting high-level games.
They also know that each training is crucial.
Which makes a player like me want to face and provide the maximum.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti brings me a lot about my positioning.
He was supported by assistants like Claude Makeelle, who played the same position as I did.
Is he the man of the situation?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect among all technicians.
Today he has no equal in League 1 and is one of the best European coaches.
He has a great experience and has won many titles with hot clubs.
He sided with great players.
I think he'll win other titles in Paris.
In January, I had a comforting discussion with him.
I was out of a series of injuries then.
The trust he gives me also explains my performance.
What are you looking at the first part of the GSP season?
In League 1, Lyon took over as our leader.
But we stay in ambush.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we qualified for the 8th final with the way.
What is the club's objective in this competition?
We'll try to go as far as possible.
Now everything can happen.
But we will have our word to say in the face of very good European teams.
First we want to finish first of our chicken, in front of Porto, to receive at the 8th final return.
Can the PSG become a large European club in the short term?
He already has the budget...
In order to become a large European club, Paris needs to win titles and register in the duration.
Today, that is not the case.
Financially, the GSP is providing the means for this project to be implemented.
In League 1, not winning the title, like last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
This year, we're really looking forward to imputing this champion title.
Last season, we didn't go far.
In May, there was disappointment because we had the qualities to finish first.
We had a very big season.
We're done with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, we're supposed to be champions...
But another team, Montpellier, has achieved an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's the right one.
Although big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have the weapons to take it.
Do you think the media expect too much of the PSG?
It's normal that a lot of us are expected in view of what has been invested and the players we have.
We totally accept it.
Then, when you win 4-0 at home against Troyes and you still find things to blame for, it's for sure it's a little frustrating.
We wonder what people expect more.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We're not the FC Barcelona!
We're trying to put in place a game project.
A team is built over time.
We've proven in the League some champions that we could respond to.
Look at Manchester City, which has not been able to qualify for the 8th finals for two seasons, they have also made huge expenses!
In view of the sums invested, you were pictured with 15 points ahead of the truce!
It was neglecting our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not well last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we can have the smile by telling us that, despite all the difficulties, we have finally overcome it.
The GSP seems totally dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic's operations.
It's better that we say there's a "Zlatan dependence."
This means that Ibrahimovic is very successful and that he sets many goals.
He came for this and he proves he's the star of League 1.
He showed everywhere he went that he was a great player, a world star.
Within the group, we respect the man and the player.
He also respects the men he has around him.
What he did was really exceptional.
This motivates others to raise their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone to make progress.
How did you live the Euro 2012 with the French team?
Like a disappointment.
I was keen to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from grappling with playing time.
I've seen things there and I've been strengthened.
Today, I manage to perform good games in selection.
That's what I've been hoping for since my baptism with the Blues.
Lessons have been learned from what has happened in Ukraine, and today we must have exemplary behaviour.
What are you looking at in Didier Deschamps' first months at the head of the Blues?
He's got the results for him.
We are well placed in the qualifying group for the World.
The picker is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires the winning.
Like Laurent Blanc was.
But I don't want to make comparisons.
White had achieved its goal by qualifying us for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the Blues to Brazil.
Is the good null (1-1) taken from Spain on 16 October a founding game?
This game gave us confidence.
Everyone's been fighting for everybody.
Before this shock in Spain, I had never had a similar game in my career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
On the contrary, current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing costs among stakeholders.
Furthermore, as often as in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, made of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible to dollars, euros...) and a secure exchange protocol in the way of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of pairs of files.
About 200,000 transactions have already been recorded thanks to 15,000 computers on the network.
A small thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a means of payment.
The bitcoin course, after reaching a top of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, dropped to $2, five months later, before returning today about ten dollars (the courses are recorded on the bitcoincharts.com site).
Nothing very impressive, compared to world trade in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in the report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency", "in competition with the dollar or the euro" and "like conventional currencies".
Bitcoin distinguishes itself from other types of virtual currency such as "credit", used to advance in a video game you win by playing or you can buy (and sometimes exchange in return).
The Facebook social network has also developed this kind of system.
But each time, a central authority controls and deals with trade.
With Bitcoin, all the nodes in the network are both depositors of the book of accounts, auditors, money issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually made between two e-mail addresses.
Unless a user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the bitcoins exchanged exist well in the public account book, distributed throughout the network.
The key step is to write this new transaction into this book.
It passes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to computers, and whose winner, as a temporary central banker, will be privileged to add this additional line.
It is a phase of file axe, i.e. transforming a large file into a shorter and more unique fingerprint.
Computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before "hate" the whole.
The aim is to find the number that gives a particular footprint (many zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes easily verify that it is the right one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of all other transactions; any change would change the fingerprint.
If, to cheat, one user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (less than ten minutes), only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other remaining orphan because both have different prints.
The computer that solved the challenge won 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this reward is divided by two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible up to a hundred millionth, leaving the margin...
The challenge challenge is also identified at each increase in the calculus power.
The life of the network has already had high and low.
Web sites providing Bitcoin services have been attacked and bitcoins in stolen deposits.
"The fault used does not concern the protocol itself," says Pierre Noizada, who has just launched Paymium, a payment company in real currency using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports on the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this defect.
Weight actors like Wikipedia refuse the gifts of this nature.
Others, such as the WordPress blog platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, from the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the book of accounts and showed that almost 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, giant balances were launched.
"Three thousand dollars have been exchanged," exclaimed Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizada, also author of a textbook on this currency, believes much about the potential of this technology as a network of transactions.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a mobile payment without contact, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which are less expensive.
The carrier also manages his identity and can therefore be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement at merchants, who do not need to install new terminals or software.
It is enough for them to communicate an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize," says Pierre Noizada, who ensures thousands of users.
There is a general movement to question hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
"It will take some time for Bitcoin to be required, but 2013 could be a turning point," he says.
The ECB, in its report, also plans to reassess the various risks, which are now considered high, in the event of the success of this currency.
We left Afghanistan.
And then what?
French troops left their zone of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapsa and Surobi).
NATO and Americans are expected to follow in late 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future without waiting for us.
It was mainly the Afghan peasants that we punished by considering them as terrorists.
And we ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, and the wounded, the mutilated.
The Taliban are composed of foreign extremists, former refugee leaders in Pakistan, but often peasants who refuse foreign military presence, such as Soviet times.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even though they have been joined by jihadists, Pakistani, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes assisted by local insurgents, they will no longer do so when the Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I observed from the top of the hills planted with almond trees thanks to French credits, was done in order.
Truck and armoured convoys joined Kabul without being attacked, overflew by helicopters.
There will be no transfer of Taliban to Kabul from the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since their irresistible progress from 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was then empty, the country with fire and blood due to struggles between different factions.
Their control of the country had then been perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans paid the price of the obscurantity of these peasants exceeded by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved today.
Former Modjahidin, the Afghan government and current Taliban join in the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main notables of the anti-Soviet war came to power in 2001.
They moved into businessmen, taking advantage of government lands to resell them into land to build for refugees from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from huge US subcontracting contracts.
They have disconsidered themselves; most of them have not fought themselves.
People, as I heard in the campaigns, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have been able to take advantage of American enlargements: the flight of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and their ideologies.
They have sided with the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan, and appreciated their benefits.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years old; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one fifth of the total population.
In cities, government schools are full of girls as well as boys.
It will be necessary to provide work to these young people who will no longer want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
All, including armed opponents, are teeming with mobile phones; television, and its Turkish leaflets, which present a modern world, are followed everywhere.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who order it be considered legitimate?
Former anti-Soviet commanders are already concerned about reconstitution of provincial militias, which will escape central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, to the strong local identities, should be able to benefit from some decentralization, in the image of Western nations, but the United States wanted to transform it into a central state, to a strong presidential power, eliminating the position of Prime Minister that existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially when the elections are scheduled for April 2014.
But its country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and long ago.
No industry has been released, no dam is in condition, no major irrigation system is repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruit and vegetables.
Priority is left to the private initiative.
In a country ruined by thirty years of war, government control over infrastructure would have been necessary.
The noise was widespread that Afghanistan had immense mining wealth.
This has only added to the feeling that the Westerners were only there to take it.
Without energy to treat on-site iron or copper or means of transport to export it through the mountains, there is no mining operation.
The Chinese have already almost left the copper mine of My Aynak, allowing international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to search the vast Buddhist site and remain the largest employers in the province.
One day it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, largely dependent on imports and exports, to restore normal relations.
The departure of French combat troops ended on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: high school of girls, boys, French department at the university, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, to try to "gain hearts and minds" and accomplish the impossible task of co-occurring aid and offensive actions, a "civil-military shares" service of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), abolished in 2012, has carried out, and carried out, by a small French NGO, numerous collective interest work and agricultural rehabilitation actions in dozens of mountain villages.
This work, which was made of local labour, was able to help contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increased arable areas.
What will we remember after two billion euros of military spending?
A much more modest budget would contribute to improving local living conditions, which are very hard in these valleys which are often more than 2,000 metres high.
The Embassy received dozens of written requests for small agricultural achievements from local communities in Kapisa province.
To free themselves from the insurrection carried out by foreign groups, as farmers have said they would like, it would be necessary to maintain in their favour a small civilian aid, well controlled and directly affecting them.
A Constitution in Forceps in Egypt
This is a new poker shot by President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration, which temporarily grants it full powers, it has decided to play its total.
Taking everyone short, he announced on Wednesday that the constituent Assembly would vote for its final text the following day.
Just a week ago, the head of state had given this House two additional months to finish its work.
It was soon two years before Egypt relied on a provisional text, several times amending what weakened institutional stability and led to legal fraud.
This new initiative has only increased the fracture in the country.
For his opponents, the President perseveres in his "autocratic delirium", continuing to "trahir his word" and "pietinate the law".
On the side of its supporters, it is ensured that it is a means of bringing an end to the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible, accelerating the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 15 days.
A very short period of time that obliges the Brothers to give up their project to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way of finding popular and democratic legitimacy while the challenge rages throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote favourably, as he stated in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Therefore, the use of a hasty vote is based on the ultimatum of the Egyptian people: " Either you vote for my text or I keep full powers," they are supposed to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of this constituent assembly, a large majority of Islamists, voted on the text yesterday.
Most of the Liberals were missing in the call.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had knocked on the door, believing that they could not have defended their views.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities or civil society had done the same.
In order for the necessary quorum to be reached, 11 people, replacement members, were added to the hurry yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brothers.
Without surprise, the articles were voted unanimously most often.
Commentators were also amused by the fact that one of the only differences of the day had been expressed around... the hour of prayer, some members of the committee felt that the constituent's pendulum was wrong.
The text, which was still being voted on last night, contains 234 articles.
Subjects of all attention, article 2 is finally identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, stipulating that "the principles of sharia are the main source of law."
Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a major claim, hoped to be able to replace "the principles" with "the rules", which would have made it possible for stricter application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been modified is a guarantee of their goodwill and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy," answered the Liberals, who saw only one shot of communication.
For they believe that the Islamization of the Constitution is carried out through other articles.
They include article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular with regard to verifying compliance with the laws with the sharia.
According to Egypt's expert Sophie Pommier, it's worrying because "people called to pronounce are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
We can see the beginnings of a theocracy."
The fears of the Liberals are further aroused by the fact that the next rector of this university should be much less moderate than the present one.
"At present, there is no concrete religious involvement.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil state.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not Ulemas but academics, for some trained in the French system" Alexis Blouet, who prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he recognizes "that there may be an ambiguity around section 220, as the terms used are used in the religious vocabulary.
It refers to the "fiqh" in particular [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].
And the question might in the future arise as to the extent to which civil judges are competent to decide on it."
Beyond its religious aspect, the text voted yesterday is highly criticised because of its extensive powers to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brothers argue that they are significantly reduced compared to what they were under the former regime.
Another contentious point: the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the review of the Defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a National Defence Council.
No more than civil trials in military courts, as requested by human rights associations, will be prohibited.
The latter also share their concerns about the text, which they consider to be liberticide.
The offence of blasphemy is maintained and the insult is now prohibited, which could have serious consequences on freedom of expression, including the press.
In addition, no article echoes the protection of women, stresses Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture under article 36.
The word did not appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to speak on television last night, demonstrations were scheduled this afternoon.
The support of the Head of State will take place on Saturday.
In Israel, holy places, the World Centre and a sea of salt await Ukrainian tourists
The Promised Land brings together the grandeur of Bible truths, modern comfort, and a wild nature.
Argumenty i Fakty has retained five great reasons to go to Israel.
Go worship the holy places
Make yourselves indispensable: the banks of the Jordan, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that anyone who enters these "baptismal foundations" will be affected by the Divine Grace.
As for Galilee, it is the land of Jesus' miracles: where the water was changed into wine, where Jesus walked on the water, where the storm fell, or where the fishing was miraculous.
It is at this precise place that Jesus appeared before his disciples after the Resurrection.
But where you will find the most holy places, it is in Jerusalem.
The believers walk there the Rue de la Suffrance or the road of Croix (in Latin: the Via Dolorosa).
This road begins near the fortress Antonia (the pretoria), where the trial was held, then led through the streets of the old city to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on the Golgotha, towards the place of the Crucifixion, then towards the place of the Peter of the Onction and the burial place.
This is where the Christian center of the world stands, symbol of humanity's salvation.
According to Christian legend, the monastery of the Cross is erected in the place where the tree was grown used to make the cross on which Jesus was crucified.
Jerusalem also houses the most sacred place of the Jews: the Wall of Lamentations, which constitutes the rest of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 B.C.
According to tradition, people of different confessions leave small words with prayers that are then answered.
Travel in height
Visit the ruins of the fortress Massada, former refuge against enemies built by Herod the Great in 25 BC. J-C. for his family.
These ruins are located on the abrupt rocks of a mountain 450 m above sea level.
Only mountaineering lovers can go there by their own means.
For others, a cable car takes them to this summit full of history.
In the north of the country, between 1,600 and 2,040 m of altitude, there is the Mont Hermont ski resort which welcomes many tourists in the winter.
A shuttle can take you there from the foot of the mountain.
The ski slopes are 45 km long.
Old beliefs want pagan gods to inhabit the top of the mountain once.
Visit unique museums
This country houses nearly 300 museums.
It is impossible to visit them all during one stay.
These are the five most interesting ones that really deserve the detour.
First: the Israel Museum near the Knesset (Parliament).
It houses the very ancient manuscripts of Qumran, or manuscripts of the Dead Sea, discovered in the caves of the Desert of Judea, as well as nearly 500 miles of archaeological and anthropological objects.
See also: the Tel-Aviv Art Museum.
There are mainly the canvases of Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Acre, the Hammam Al-Basha awaits you with its Turkish baths composed of moldings of visitors and overseers of the time.
Once in Caesarea, enter the only Private Ralli Museum where you can admire the sculptures of Rodin.
There are no guides or souvenir shops.
Entrance is free and gifts are prohibited.
The fifth museum is the Holocaust or Memorial Museum of Yad Vashem, located in Tel-Aviv, which returns to the most dramatic historical pages in history.
The most tragic part is the children's memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children exterminated in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter and enter into total darkness.
Stars sparkle.
Then you hear the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health and well-being
The three large seaside resorts of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each of them offers swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and giant aquariums.
Note: you can swim in the Red Sea even in winter, as the water temperature does not drop below 21° while the air temperature can reach 23°.
The Dead Sea is even hotter and you can swim there all year round.
By the way, it is the most unique sea in the world: it occupies the lowest point on Earth, or 417 m below sea level.
The blue water contains brine and very easily holds swimmers, even those who cannot swim.
The landscapes surrounding it are of surrealistic beauty.
We come here to treat various diseases such as dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes but also to simply relax.
Discover the secrets of antiquity
They are kept by the old town of Tel-Aviv, Jaffa, on the edge of the Mediterranean Sea.
It is crossed by the famous Via Maris that links Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in the Greek and Egyptian legends of ancient times.
According to legend, this is where Noah built his ark and that Persée saved the beautiful Andromede, with whom he lived here a long and happy life.
Tourists especially like to walk in narrow alleys that bear the name of the signs of the zodiac.
It is said that if you touch the street walls corresponding to "your" sign, destiny will smile at you.
In Jaffa you will be able to meet young married people who come to take photo sessions from all Israel and even other countries.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you will be able to walk in the Roman theater, "conquering" the fortress of the Crusades.
Under the Roman Empire, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera shows.
Note to tourists
If you leave for Israel, don't worry about your English: about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
For your trip, it is better to prefer dollars to the euro because they are easily interchangeable in shekels (now 1 dollar equals 3.8 shekels).
As far as urban transport is concerned, it is mainly buses, but Jerusalem is equipped with a quick tram and Haifa has the only metro line in the country, composed of six stations and able to connect the lower and upper parts of the city.
It's almost an underground funicular.
The journey in all types of public transport costs 6 shekels and allows you to make changes for 1h30.
In Israel, Jewish tradition wants to celebrate Saturday.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, markets, stores and public transport cease to operate.
And the work week starts on Sunday morning.
Many cafes, restaurants and hotels serve only casher food, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes consisting of both milk and meat.
It offers a whole multitude of dishes based on lamb and beef, soups and desserts based on coconut milk but also hamus, traditional Jewish pasta, various sauces, soft chick peas balls, falafels, fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
On the other hand, there are many well-fed cats that walk up the high air.
We can see them sleeping on the roofs of cars parked in the evening.
These felines love the passing places and do not refuse to be given them.
The rental of a car varies according to the brand of $37 for 24 hours (Hyundai Getz) at $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance costs $15 a day.
Renting a bike will cost you 15 shekels a day.
An entrance to the museum costs on average 30 shekels.
The language of the figures
Three million tourists from around the world visited Israel in 2012.
These were mainly people who came to travel and rest from the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
118.8 miles of Ukrainian tourists visited the Promised Land from January to October 2012, 51% more than in 2010, before the cancellation of visas on February 9, 2011.
"Who language has, in Moscow goes": migrants save money to learn the language
While MPs and human rights activists dispute what the law on compulsory language testing will give, fraudsters selling "false" certificates have already made their appearance in the country
Each year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of the time, they are nationals of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal: to earn money to help their families stay at home.
Since 1 December, a law has entered into force and stipulates that each migrant worker will have to pass a Russian examination.
For the time being, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the services, housing, services to individuals and retail.
However, over time, the Federal Migration Service promises, testing will become mandatory for all immigrants.
Moreover, knowledge of the language will have to be validated, but also that of the history of Russia and the foundations of law.
It will be necessary to validate its language knowledge in Russian to obtain and renew its work permit.
Only nationals of countries where Russian has official language status are exempt.
Persons who obtained certificates or diplomas before the fall of the USSR in 1991 are also not affected by this law.
Beneficial, negative attitude and protection of rights
The Network of Review Centres will be under the auspices of the Russian-language Institute Pouchkine, the University of People's Friendship, the University of State of Moscow, the University of State of St. Petersburg and other higher education institutions of Russia.
Immigrants will be able to pass examinations in all cities in the country: more than 160 centres have already been opened throughout the country.
This initiative to introduce reviews was supported by MPs of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service.
But before the law comes into force, human rights defenders have already repeatedly asked the question in the press: what is it going to do?
What will the obligation to know Russian change for Russians and immigrants?
First, the representatives of the migration service respond, which will reduce the number of people suffering from "slavery at work".
Many speak about the rights of migrant workers, explains the director of the Russian Federal Migration Service office in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.
The protection of rights must begin before they leave.
Only an organized selection system will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise for migrants without a profession, without training, those who do not know the language and do not have medical certificates.
Without understanding the language, certifies Sebelev, the future migrant is destined to cross dishonest people who, on the pretext of helping him, will provide him with a "travel" in an overcrowded little house where he and dozens of his fellows will be tormented for months without food and paper and will have to travel between 12 and 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
"In them, they are promised one thing, and when they arrive, they are deceived, they take their passport, and they don't touch the expected salary," said the Head of the Migration Services Directorate for the work of the Migration Service of Tajikistan, Tolib Charipov.
Don't argue with me, officer!
However, many citizens of Central Asian republics who wish to come to gain money in Russia are confident that they do not only know the language of the country where they want to go, but also write with difficulty in their own language.
It is not their fault, of course, but their misfortune: few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to pursue only a passable primary education.
Indeed, their families don't even have to feed their children without talking about dress them properly and equip them for school.
As soon as they reach adolescence, these young people will earn money as soon as the opportunity arises.
It's hard when we don't know the language, they trust.
"You feel like you're down and down."
However, human rights defenders note an important aspect of the language law.
The examinations will only be for migrants who have legal status.
Without statute, there will be no formal examination or work thereafter.
However, most migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or defence of entry"
Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy to obtain official status in Russia.
Why? The administrative barriers and always these language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: between 12 and 16 thousand rubles.
And then you can get a fake registration quickly for only 1,500 rubles.
The Russian police know that we have false documents, that we do not have registration, and that is why cases of extortion are involved.
"They ask us 100, 200 rubles, what to buy cigarettes, tea," told journalists Umed Khouchkadamov, a citizen of Tajikistan.
"Quickly, don't read and buy yourself a beautiful work of art"
From the first day of the entry into force of the Language Act, it was found that the registration papers of migrants were not the only ones to be false.
Several false language examination certificates have already been confiscated by employees of the Federal Migration Service.
The falsified paper comes out of an ordinary color printer.
Of course, their new owners had nothing to do with them: each migrant who hoped to facilitate the task of examinations had to pay seven thousand rubles for this document.
It is twice and a half more expensive than the official procedure: it will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles.
Power representatives and human rights defenders agree that the short-term goal is to protect the system from corruption so that it is impossible simply to buy these "paper topics".
The authorities may give migrant workers who were unable to validate the examination of the first time to take language courses.
In addition, immigrants who do not know Russian will be offered work in areas that do not involve active communication with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not deal with the arms market
The share of crimes involving legal weapons is very low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior proposes to harden the law against civilian arms carriers.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: whether it is the shootings carried out at weddings or the murder organized by Moscow's lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, who killed seven people.
The police want to prohibit the wearing of rubber bullets in public places and raise the legal age of obtaining a permit to carry weapons from 18 to 21 years.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that the amendments to the arms law would be introduced to the State Duma shortly.
Everyone is not pleased to see that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by "sealing the screw".
An open letter appeared on the Net in which its authors, representatives of various shooting centres, demand that "this foolish hardening" be abandoned.
The percentage of crimes committed with a recorded weapon is minimal, declared to the Russian service Vasiliy Lesnikov, a lawyer and a crime specialist for the BBC.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, over a period of six months in 2012, 142 crimes were committed with a firearm registered in the police services, while 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded over the same period.
The authors of the open letter are certain that strengthening civil arms laws will not prevent criminals from supplying themselves to the black market .
According to them, we can find today in Moscow any weapon for a reasonable price.
However, the Ministry of the Interior asserts that it controls the dissemination of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factory to officer
The black arms market provides itself with several channels.
The main channels are five, reports Victor Baranets, a retired colonel who served ten years in the Ministry of Education and the Headquarters.
Screenshot taken from a site taking control of weapons
The first is "the military trace", that is, the weapons that were stolen during military operations in the Caucasus.
"These weapons were stolen by Russian officers, but also by Caucasians," Baranets explains.
The second type of weapons from the black market is those stolen by law enforcement criminals.
Baranets explains that these are both weapons stolen in police stocks and those stolen directly from law enforcement officials.
Illegal pistols are on sale from military warehouses.
Many of these have often suffered explosions.
"Certified versions indicate that some fires have been set in motion to conceal the deficit," said the former military officer.
For Baranets, weapons manufacturers are there for something.
"We see private arms factories that don't compete with competition in the international market and run weapons on the black market, especially in Moscow," says one expert.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
A large part of guns and machine guns come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a local production, sometimes artisanal, a mafia has formed and organizes the supply," the former military adds.
Where do guns come from?
Experts assessed the approximate share of each source of illegal weapons in the black market.
A report on this issue was prepared in 2011 by the Public Administration Problem Analysis and Study Centre.
Experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminal records and public data from arms portals.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, explain the researchers, come from the army and the law enforcement forces.
Half of the weapons present in the black market have been found "in the absence of employees whose work is related to arms," the report explains.
According to researchers, 17% of weapons come from places of military conflict, 14% are stolen at the time of manufacture, and 5% are from " clandestine searches".
A seller and consultant of an armory who has asked to keep anonymity ensures that for a long time no one buys the weapons found by these underground search specialists; they are too old.
Most of the time, according to him, sellers will search for new goods in military warehouses.
The person buys through a sign a unit, e.g. a TT gun.
We deliver it to him by passing the goods through a grill.
"He transports it to the city and resale it for 900 € per unit with two chargers," he says.
"It is true that the police are aware of all cases, so when crimes are about to be cleared up, they make a purchase of control from illegal arms merchants," the seller adds.
"Like in a luxury shop"
The seller and buyer are generally found through knowledge.
I consulted websites, blogs, until a guy showed up and proposed to come to Begovaya station where someone would take me into a "coin" to market.
The gun price, I got it on site.
Victor Baranets as a military observer
To find a gun, I need to know someone who has a contact, explains the seller. I know someone, but I don't trust him.
There are vendors on the markets, but there we must also come by saying, "On the part of such a person, who asked me to transmit that his daughter has lost a tooth."
Now I even buy a pair of American fists with the help of someone I trust.
He only delivers them to me because he knows I won't give it to him.
Young people are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military officer Victor Baranets tried as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he was preparing to publish an article on the subject.
The patterns, according to him, have not changed.
He was given a photo album in which there was "everything we want."
"I believed in a luxury store," the military remembers.
There's no secret for the buyer, Baranets explains, we can try everything.
As a potential customer, I'm not just buying, we're going with the forest vendor and we're installing a target.
"I'm allowed to be shot and when I'm convinced that the weapon works well, we start negotiating," the expert describes.
A store from his sofa
Search engines display the sites and groups on Vkontakte where you can buy weapons "for different uses".
This requires no document and no one to meet.
"It's enough to have a precise amount of money," we wrote in advertising on the site "Buying a gun or a combat machine gun."
Users leave their request and ask their questions.
And we sell to minors?
"No permission, of course," asks the user "Ivan" (held spelling).
"Buy TT. Moscow", writes "Fedorenkov" in his very direct request.
The Federal Security Service has distributed a vast network of fake sites and collects people who want to buy combat weapons.
People burst into food like hungry wolves and then find themselves exploiting coal in Siberia

I have heard of this type of scheme: generally, the site is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer makes payment on automatic terminals.
"He receives in return a photo and instructions indicating where the weapon is hidden," explains the Secretary of the Association "Right to a weapon", Dmitry Kislov.
Victor Baranets claims that if you apply on the site, you can find yourself without a gun and behind the bars.

One Makarov for 100 dollars
The purchase of an illegal firearm, estimated by experts, can cost between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the "Right to a weapon" association, we can buy a Makarov pistol for $100-300.
We'll have to wait about a month and a half.
It came out of long-term warehouses by the management of these medium-sized warehouses.
According to the Department's official data, compared to the period January-October 2011, the overall number of such crimes decreased by 7% in Russia and reached 22.9 miles, while the cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosive substances and bombs decreased by 7.8%.
United States: Fast food and supermarket employees are on strike
Nearly a quarter of American teenagers go through cashier work at McDonald's
In recent days, a wave of protests has risen against the low wages practiced by Walmart supermarkets and famous fast food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
For the time being, no one can predict whether this wave will increase or blow rapidly.
These actions are supported by trade unions and a number of associations on the left.
In parallel with the increase in the modest wages the basic employees receive at Walmart and in fast-restoration chains, the event organizers want to obtain the creation of trade unions.
This sector is not currently covered by the union movement.
46 cents a year?
The demonstrations began last week, after Thanksgiving, the "Black Friday", when a dwindling rain of balances from millions of inhabitants fell on America and sometimes triggered sparks.
On that day, some employees of the Walmart company, who work around the world 2.2 million people, left their jobs to organize strike pickets with trade unions and left-wing activists in the shops of the company whose products are intended for consumers of modest and medium-sized classes.
Walmart sells everything: layers of hunting rifles passing through car batteries, vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products are on average 8% to 27% less expensive than in large supermarkets.
That's why many poorly paid employees at Walmart only run at their workplace.
The price and choice of products made Walmart one of the most powerful groups in the United States.
According to criticism, Walmart can afford to sell its cheap products, particularly because of the low wages of its employees.
They also complain about difficult working conditions, such as the lack of lifts or portable scanners.
The participants of the "Black Friday" events asked for an increase in salary, complained that the price of health insurance provided by the company had increased from $30 to $100 per month.
For the base employee at Walmart who pays $9.5 an hour, it's an amount he can't afford.
Scientists from the California University of Berkley demonstrate that if Walmart increased the average salary to $12 an hour, it would cost the group $3.2 billion.
It is 1.1 per cent more than it currently spends.
If Walmart transferred all the increase in wages on the shoulders of consumers, each race in the store would return to 46 cents more.
They will spend only $12.39 in one year more than now.
Walmart supporters noted with satisfaction that protests took place in only nine states and did not bring any harm to the group.
The "Black Friday" continued in stores from 8:00 p.m. at midnight the following day and Walmart sold 5000 items in the second period.
His cashiers made a total of 100 million transactions for the Black Friday.
The spokesperson for Dan Fogleman assured in an interview at the left-hand site Huffington Post that in all "less than five" Walmart employees had left their positions and that the protest was only a "com operation among so many others" by the union organizer.
"Next customer!"
The protests continued this week in New York and also concerned Walmart stores (in this progressive city, they are not very appreciated, that is why they are not yet installed) but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's announces selling billions of portions and then they don't even give you sick leave and don't pay you for the work you've done honestly!
Jumaane Williams, Member of the City Council of New York
Currently, the minimum wage provided for by federal and New York legislation is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food increases them over time, but little by little its basic employees reach New York $8.90 an hour.
No one's touching anything less than them in this town.
It's unthinkable for me to live with that sum in New York.
It was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers worked at McDonald's after high school while still living at their parents'.
Few people saw their main source of income or wished to remain there for a long time.
Today, I find myself interviewing McDonald's employees who complain about having to live with this salary and sometimes having to feed their children with it.
On the other hand, in the Wall Street Journal forum there are comments saying it is irresponsible to make children if you don't know what you're going to feed them with.
Protesters who launched the march Thursday at 6:30 p.m. near McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue demanded that the cashiers and cooks of the fast-food be paid at least $15 an hour, a multiplication of more than twice the current minimum wage.
They also called for trade unions to be created in the fast-restoration sector.
The U.S. law prohibits the administration from obstructing and punishing the protestors of a trade union through bullying or dismissal.
However, administration rarely simplifies life.
For a union, taking over fast restoration remains a difficult task, and that, for concrete reasons.
One of the most important is the extraordinary rotation of staff.
They don't agree
Other tumultuous events were held near several other fast-restoration channels.
The highlight of the protest was the mid-day gathering near the McDonald's Times Square with the intervention of several local democratic policies, including that of Jumaane Williams, a member of the Municipal Council, who said: "McDonald's announces selling billions of portions and after them don't even give you sick leave and don't pay you for the work you have done honestly!".
The demonstrators were supported by other New York Democrats for the purpose, notably by Mayor Bill De Blasio's candidate, who stated that "we all must support the employees of the quick restoration so that they get a fair wage and the economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves.
The New York Times characterized this event as the most important event in the fast food industry throughout its history.
But only a few hundred people participated in it without counting that not all were fast-food employees, who employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is currently difficult to tell whether this spark of mass movement will make small ones.
"At the moment, we only manage to cheat the brain"
Lately, fans of new technologies have become accustomed to perception of the increased reality through special glasses.
At first, it was Google who unveiled its current model this summer at its annual conference and in November it was learned that Microsoft had applied for the patent.
However, it appears from the interview with the director of the interactive 3D technology group of the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge, Shahram Izadi, that for the scientists of this society, the glasses are already from ancient history.
They are tempted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in bare-handed air, by creating open virtual spaces.
- Could you tell us in a few words what your research group is doing?
- We work on the interaction between man and machine and we try at the same time to widen the boundaries of this interaction.
Humanity as a whole has remained for the moment pixels on flat screen and sometimes touch.
We want to look 5 to 10 years ahead of us and guess the radical changes that will occur with this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox sells today without Kinect because everyone is interested in controlling the gesture.
- What does the future hold for us?
- Although Kinect made the physical interaction, many things happen on flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The information capture has been improved (the system receives more data), but the performance, for the time being, is not really.
We're trying to change this and we're working on truly 3D imaging systems that work on different technologies, including projection technologies.
We need to get the computer world out in our physical world to make it more touchy.
For this, however, it is necessary to identify not only the user, but also the space around it.
Thus, we can complement the real world with virtual objects in a more practical form.
And first of all, let's get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
She's appreciated, but isn't she overestimated?
It cannot be said that it is the panacea: the question of confidentiality arises because we do not always want to inform others about its actions or intentions.
In fact, each type of interaction with the computer is good, but each one in his niche.
For example, to order devices in public places, we had a project for which we thought of gestures, not broad gestures, but rather discreet, restricted gestures.
The gestures were not captured by the camera, but by a hand-held bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is currently large, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to the size of a watch.
In fact, the future will be marked by the mixed order, for example: gesture + voice.
- That's what I mean?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass that cane on?
You would do it with the word and with the gestures.
- Usually, I'm just talking.
- Oh, it's gonna be hard to recognize.
- So you want to force users to adapt to what the machine can or can not do at any given time?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual rapprochement.
I think that very soon we will have to work on developing new types of sensors that will enable us to better identify man's reactions.
For example, it can be laser sensors, they produce a fairly good resolution in depth and it is very important.
- If we're interested in your work on Xbox Kinect sensors, what do you not like in modern cameras?
Are they lacking resolution, depth or anything else?
- In principle, it's the current generation that we base our work on 3D recognition.
Of course it would be good to get about 8 megapixels at a speed of 1000 c/s.
But the problem is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
In relation to this last point, all current technologies are quite good, adding work to algorithm designers.
We need to keep in mind the resolution according to the X and Y axes, but also Z.
The speed also counts a lot, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and the 30 c/s are not really enough, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche from our Redmond laboratory gave sensors a regular delay in treatment between 1 and 100 μs, with current sensors closer to the second value (60-100).
Everyone does not understand how this affects the interaction of man and machine.
I'd really need a device like this in my work, but not necessarily touching, to have more executives in the second.
- But don't we have to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three cameras, one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other one, a receiver of the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually an ordinary sensor of the visible field.
It is not used to define the depth of the object.
A lot of cameras could solve this problem...
Or empress it by increasing the required volume of calculations.
It would be interesting to create a soft product similar to Kinect, play with the camera curve and see how it could help define the locations.
- As much as I remembered, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present his glasses to the public.
Do you not think that from a point of view of the daily use of enhanced reality technologies, glasses are one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, walking all the time with a smartphone your raised hands is not practical but here's what I think: the best option would be an increased "transitory" reality that would allow you from a cloud platform to pass glasses on to the smartphone.
The glasses are a very personal device and this is what makes them strong (the personal elements are the ones you are the only to see) and at the same time their weakness: the reality increased from the glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people.
- Let's imagine that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is no longer accessible only to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to the mere mortal.
There is a problem on which opponents of this idea point their finger: there is no touch sensation!
Hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my course, I often say that the increased reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth could very well be adding touch sensations.
For the moment, one of the interesting techniques is the use of the second hand to serve as image support.
It records the pressures perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are actually intended to attribute palpability to these "images in the air": for example, the interference of several ultrasonic rays directed towards a specific point where the finger is located and which gives you the sensation, for the moment still weak, of an air blow on the ends of the fingers.
There are also the bracelets worn on the wrists that influence the nerve endings of the fingers, they are also a working axis with perspectives.
- And you tried to deceive the brain?
Does it make him think he feels what he should normally feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried yet.
There is still a task below which it will still take a long time to get hurt: the way to make someone physically in a very small space who walks in an almost infinite open space - we work on the concepts of race rugs (regardless of those found in fitness clubs), mobile platforms and also giant balls.
At the moment, we are only able to cheat the brain, and there are still many years of work.
This makes the work on virtual reality so interesting to the researcher: many things are still in the absolute state of fertilization.
The realm of taste and not culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "The Petersburg vanguard" dedicated to the citizens who are in advance, at the forefront of culture and art.
This ultra-selective list has already welcomed prominent actors from the St. Petersburg artistic scene whose achievements go beyond the city border and have found recognition in Europe, after being known throughout Russia.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extraverted painter Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, this rather bearded man, all red-dressed that you can cross near the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden or in the parties and connected varnishes.
Kirill Miller's paintings always gather the crowds, regardless of their place of exhibition.
He is one of the deeply social and philosophical Petersburgan counters, one of the founders of the new myths.
Kirill Miller is an eminent representative of the Petersburgan vanguard in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
It is also the symbol of the city, its appearance makes the inhabitants smile and put them in a good mood.
He recently took a Barbaria organ into his hands and became the symbol of this instrument in St. Petersburg as he had matured enough for this difficult role of his existence, his philosophy and his image of Bohemian.
- Kirill, why are you walking through the city all red and not yellow or turquoise blue, for example?
- I chose red as a tailor specializing in the look and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the painter, the creator of image and society.
Even if in society, anything that is not gray provokes aggression and negative agitation.
But my provocations are intended to start the discussion.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to discussion.
- And when did you realize you were supposed to be a painter?
- At the exhibition of the Nevskiy Culture Palace where my work was located.
I realized it was my way.
So the wave of unofficial old painters had passed and the new, free, in my kind, were misunderstood.
I began to associate with the painters of the new wave, with those of the Postgazonevchtchina who gave birth to "Pouchinskaya-10" and then there was no wave.
I am interested in theatre, fashion, music, all kinds except words.
It was important for me to find myself in the heart of St. Petersburg's culture where the best creative forces must gather.
In 1995, I took a place in Pouchkinskaya-10, which was home to a music and artistic club, a Bohemian club, the house of the Bohemian Bohemian Bohemian.
Many were born there: The Nomes, Tequila-jazz, I still see Chnour arriving with the project "The ear of Van Gogh".
Chnour and his friends sang easy play-back songs in moulding shirts, they counted among them Igor Vdovin, composer today in fashion.
When the group began to produce live, it became "Leningrad".
Trakhtenberg was a good showman before the time of Hali Gali.
We gave them Trakhtenberg and it was when his great career began, but his basic education and training, he received them from us.
Gallery "D137", Club "Griboiedov": these are impacts of the Artistic Clinic.
Our employees went there as usual.
I am a hero of the past century, of the time when culture wanted to say something.
In 2000, a survey was organized in the press: it was the "The personalities of our city" award.
I was named "Painter of the Year," and that's when my reign ended.
It is not convenient to work in a new era with old rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, you can be popular, but not really a person of culture.
- Your work is characterized by a recognizable style.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they have a very strong news and acuity.
I'm going to have an exhibition scheduled "The Russian Museum through the clowns".
Clowns belong to an timeless category.
Before I was a social person, today it hurts and it scares me to be like this.
But with the clowns, everything clears up, the tragic falls down.
I like grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the idea of saving the world through total and mandatory disguise.
Today it is the habit that matters, we are interested in the external mechanism, but not within the person.
Maybe we can't give him a hand, but we have to spit on him.
And the lie will be erased by the disguise.
We've seen you recently in the role of the Barbarian organ player.
Who else can play it.
- But maybe commercial art can also be beautiful?
- Today commercial art must be treated, delicate, liqueur.
A disintegration of culture is occurring.
Before, people were divided into herds, the bohemian supporters loved one thing, the nibbles another.
Today, everything is divided into micro-communities, it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar ticket to please everyone.
Today, you have to think about who you're going to like.
Every star has 100 fans.
- But thousands of people come to see Stas Mikhailov!
- They're the people we dumped who come to see him, it's the sex and social side that works.
But on the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 miles won't come and ultimately it's less management, money, everything perishes.
I have my fans, the main thing is not to deceive them, not to spoil their lives.
When I was young, I painted paintings that a collector hung next to Falk or Larionov.
I started with the paintings that are usually those we paint at the end of life.
Today, ideas are often confused.
It is said that there is spiritual culture, the culture of consumption.
Consumption has no culture, it has nothing to do with it.
I am a representative of yesterday's culture, I grew up with the example of painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty and who rejected money just for painting.
I'm for this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is this concept: the official of culture.
But not everyone can work in culture.
Under the rule of the good Tsars, it was not like that, the Tsars did not understand the culture well, but they understood that it was necessary to keep the good experts.
In Moscow, there are good consultants today.
We have people here in St. Petersburg who could be experts, but they are excluded, because there is a need for higher experts who will properly evaluate these experts and give them a way.
At present, it is the "kingdom of taste" that blooms.
The same Errata, but they differ in the sense that they honestly say that they do not take all contemporary art, that there are painters who must find other museums.
- What is St. Petersburg to you?
- Saint Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is a ground for it.
And on our stones, art has a hard time pushing.
We need cultural soil and we have more writers than readers, it's bad.
In Europe, there are many curious people who will see exhibitions, concerts.
In us, this layer is very fine.
We must make art fashionable as it was at the beginning of the last century.
Project carried out with the support of the Saint Petersburg Fellowship
Hide in space
The Earth is in danger.
Climate warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Space shuttle caravans with landmen on board are looking for a rescue planet.
To save mankind, a big question arises: how can we continue to live our species as a suffocation or as a relief planet?
I don't think there's much to choose from.
In fact, there are two real planets that can be conquered, it would only be by assumption.
"It is Venus and Mars," says Vladimir Sourdine, researcher at the State Astronomical Institute P.K. Chternberg (GAICH).
If on Mars the conditions are more suitable for life, the temperature on the surface of Venus is 500 .
We can only live there at very high altitude or on the orbit of Venus... in space.
We began to take an interest in issues of reproduction in space by focusing on flora.
There is still a half century ago, experiments were carried out on plants.
Four generations of small peas grown in orbit did not differ in any way from terrestrial varieties.
Then, insects were placed in orbit, small reproductive drosophile flies.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into outer space to see how an embryo developed in a scallop.
At the exit we get a pretty normal kitten.
Then the problems begin.
"The problem is related to the fact that the kitten has to find support, it has to get on its feet and start moving," explains the director of the laboratory of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems at the Russian Academy of Sciences (IMP) Vladimir Sychev.
When there was no support, the puppies were acting out of order.
And at the end of 10 hours, the new babies saw their instincts completely atrophied.
The chicks did not react to light or sound.
Unfortunately, they would just die at the end of four days.
"We peeled their eyes twice, then we gave up, because it's simply impossible to work with them there," says Vladimir Sychev, noting the failure of the experience with the chicks in space.
The last biological "miniature ark" with animals was sent in orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in spring 2013.
However, biosatellite " Bion " will only embark on species of the same sex.
There was an experience with rats sent with their fetuses in space.
In principle, nothing supernatural was discovered.
"It was still biosatellites and then it's the only experience. This kind of research must be done," observes Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the rats of space gave birth to their offspring.
However, reproductions are not yet possible directly in space.
It's not a bad deal.
By losing their usual environment, animals are no longer able to realize their sexual instincts.
Unlike animals, man is capable, in principle.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, it is able to create a suitable emotional background.
This type of experience is not carried out for ethical reasons.
But women have been in space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was taken by Terechkova.
And the female organism is what humanity has most precious.
Our owl flew and no one on Earth could tell if it would be held after a flight into space.
If she could have given birth to a child after the flight.
"No one answered this question," explains Vakhtang Vitchnadzé, retired from the rocket and space sector.
In June 1964, just one year after her flight into space, the first cosmonaut Valentina Terechkova gave birth to a little girl.
The father of the child, Andrian Nikolaiev was also cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, after having been twice in orbit and even worked in an extra-vehicular environment, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk remains.
We have few, even very few cosmonauts that have had nothing and give birth to a healthy seed after long flights.
"And if they are longer, this presents a danger even during orbit flights," concludes the pilot and cosmonaut, heroes of the Soviet Union and heroes of Russia, Valeriy Poliakov.
Yet mankind must seek new solutions in biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravitation.
Hydrology Laboratory of the Cosmonaut Preparation Centre: mandatory flight preparation stage.
Here, in zero floatability, the cosmonauts lead to extra-vehicular exits.
The water imitates the absorber.
If for adults, water is comfortable but however a foreign environment, for infants, it is their real element.
Small amphibious men seem to confirm this: life on Earth comes from the ocean.
As the baby evolves about 9 months into the lymphatic fluid of his mother's womb, it is easier for him to get used to water afterwards.
It's in principle logical, because from birth to first bath, it's only two weeks.
"It's very little to forget," explains the swim instructor for infants, Marina Aksenova.
In a word, if for the child who has just been born the hanger is a more natural state, the woman needs gravitation, a force of weight.
In sneezing, the muscles of the belly, of the basin are very quickly atrophied, the baby's growth capacity is lost.
Okay, well, let's ignore this by relying on birth simulators.
Of course we can prepare a delivery in a special room, the woman will get him out.
"And then?" asks Valeriy Poliakov to invite you to reflect on this complex issue.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravitation.
If it does not feel the ground attraction, the organism does not form the skeleton or the muscle system.
You can't dress a baby like an adult with a special training combination.
He will simply be deprived of his vital needs.
"And this experience that we would consider in this case by imagining the birth of a child in a foreign environment will result in the return to Earth of a disabled child, completely disadapted," the Director of the Bioethics Committee of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
The birth of children in outer space is still a matter of theory.
However, in time this will become a reality, when the Terrians travel on their shuttles to a distant planet that will become the habitat of their seed born in space.
The head of the ISC (Higher Institute for Public Finance Control) stated: "the control of independent pseudo-work (in Czech " Švarc system") has failed because of politicians.
In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and quality legislation, but it is at the forefront of its implementation.
This is what Miloslav Kala, vice president of the Higher Institute for Public Finance Control said in an interview for Aktuálě.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and, in my opinion, that is what is lacking in us," Kala said in her commentary on the current situation.
Joint monitoring by Czech and German inspectors also suggests similar conclusions.
He cited as an example of abusive practice the approach of the "Švarc system" by Petr Nečas.
Mr. Prime Minister recently stated that the ODS was not going to import contractors with controls; is that permitted or prohibited?
"The law must be applied in one way or another, so if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot prevent the action of an authority responsible for inspecting compliance," says Kala.
At the meeting of the Supervisory Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you referred to a Czech-German project under which the legislation on public procurement in these two countries was compared.
What was the real issue?
This is a parallel control that we launched about two years ago.
In simple terms, European legislation provides for how public procurement and specific national legislation are managed, as well as the practice itself.
We have gathered all this and although this control procedure has not yet been completed, very interesting differences have appeared to us: generally speaking, our legislation may be "more severe and of better quality", however, according to some parameters, the practice as such is better in Germany.
This confirms, therefore, that it is not sufficient to continuously develop increasingly detailed rules but that it is necessary to devote itself to the implementation of the law itself.
How can this project help you concretely and what is the result for you?
Common control of this kind should contribute precisely to our stopping efforts to clarify the laws, to lower and improve the thresholds, when this does not have a truly positive effect.
The principle of good management means getting the matter at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest), to exclude any enrichment and possible criminal activity.
But by lowering market thresholds, we will not necessarily achieve this goal.
It may be that this system is so submerged by paperwork that those seeking fault will find much more opportunities than if the threshold had remained higher.
You are talking about internal problems relating to the implementation of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an institution similar to our ISC or a different way of organization?
With regard to institutions, similar to the ISC, the Bundesrechnungshof, which is similarly organised, also has a somewhat different board, but these two institutions basically proceed in a similar way.
The skills are also, to some extent, similar, with a nuance in relation to our system: Germany being a federal structure, therefore it also has such accounts at the level of the various Länder.
BRH can only control federal money, which corresponds to the state's resources.
Public funds managed at home by the regions and municipalities are controlled there at the level of the Länder's accounts.
As regards national legislation, is it simpler than ours?
I do not want to make a general comparison without concrete data, however, in some areas Germany is often designated as a model but it certainly cannot be said to be doing better in all areas.
Could it be because they have better inspectors?
No, I'm not sure, but I repeat, I don't have any comparison data.
However, it must also be said that this country, which we consider to be a model, is also faced with a number of problems.
Otherwise they wouldn't have any advantage in cooperating with our institution, would they?
As far as national legislation is concerned, what has been meant for you, as an institution, by the amendment of the Public Procurement Act, its effects have already been felt?
As this amendment entered into force relatively recently, it has not yet had an impact on our control operations.
As we do later checks, we have to have a certain delay.
Our comments relate only to the process of preparing future controls - we have launched a new instrument for "detachment of risk of mismanagement" with which we have gone to the crumble of nearly 14,000 public procurement - these changes will of course be felt, because the thresholds have been modified and the conditions of certain types of tender procedures and so on.
Do you therefore consider the adoption of this law to be an advantage or an additional burden for the administration?
I believe that this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that the future will confirm it.
The problem that may arise is that these rules become more stringent and that they cannot be respected.
Already under the previous regulations, the claimant (e.g. the Regional Council, in the case of regional operational programmes) forced controlled subjects to accept that any breach of the Markets Act means a breach of budgetary discipline.
Is it really useful to make the law more stringent in this way?
No, not like that, I think.
The system must exclude those who want to attack or abuse the system but not punish those who commit formal errors without consequence on the decision-making process.
Such a system will put pressure on the administration.
So what's the way to get out of it?
Let's look where we're not going.
Recently, the Prime Minister stated that the SDO was not going to import contractors with controls of the so-called Švarc system - what does that mean?
Is the Švarc system prohibited or authorized?
The law must be applied in one way or another, so if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority responsible for inspecting and requiring compliance with the law.
He can declare: "We will change the law and authorize it," but he cannot say that we will act as if it were nothing.
The Contracts Act contains relatively strict rules on the formalities to be completed, precisely in order to protect the call for tenders.
However, it is tragic that a bidder be eliminated only because of formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and it is, in my opinion, what is lacking in us.
The roads are by frozen places, but most of them remain practical.
In some parts of the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and also snowed.
However, the network remains largely practicable, in some places with increased vigilance.
Karlovy Vary Region
In the Karlovy Vary region, the roads were convenient this morning, but by frozen and also snowy places.
Temperatures have fallen and fluctuate between -5 and -10 ° C but they should slightly rise up in the day.
Snowfalls have ceased in the region and it remains in the plains only a fine layer of snow.
The ridges of the Metalliferous Mountains (Krušné hory) are, however, covered with about 30 centimeters of snow.
Data from the regional road maintenance service indicate that due to fog, visibility was reduced in places.
The R6 fast track and the region's national roads are now unhindered.
However, vigilance remains to be put, for example, on some bridges whose coating can be frozen and slippery.
All department roads and third-class roads, including mountain roads, are also feasible.
There are still some of their chunks of frozen snow leftovers and traffic-tapped areas.
Especially in high-altitude areas, drivers need to strengthen their vigilance.
Pardubice and Hradec Kralové regions
The Roads and Highways Directorate points out on its website that some roads in East Bohemia are threatened by the formation of verglas and that layers of traffic-stricken snow can be found on the roads in mountainous areas and located at altitude.
Road maintenance services warn drivers against the risk of freezing formation in areas of the Pardubice region at altitude.
There may be verglas in the vicinity of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy or Vysoké Mýto, mainly on departmental and third-class roads.
Routes I/43 and I/34 around Svitavy have been chemically treated.
Snow is mainly found in the Giant Mountains (Krkonoše) and the Eagle Mountains (Orlické hory).
In the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov, a layer of traffic-tapped snow is present on the roads in the altitude areas.
In East Bohemia, the weather will be today dry, most often clear, with possible cloud passages.
It will blow a weak wind and temperatures will generally fluctuate between -3° and + 1° C.
Pilsen Region
The roads in the Pilsen region are now viable, although, in places, there is a need to be greater vigilance and adapt its behaviour to weather conditions.
It freezes this morning, temperatures fluctuate between -3° and -9°C.
After the latest snowfalls and the cooling that followed, some channels of communication may be by frozen places.
Drivers can expect to cross fog zones, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is reflected in the information provided by the Regional Road Maintenance Service.
Highway D5 is almost unfeasible, but road communications maintenance services recommend increased vigilance between kilometres 80 and 131.
The coating of most national roads is dry and frozen.
Some sections can be frozen in the Pilsen-Sud district and in the Tachov district.
Departmental and third-class pathways are wet and in this case the warning against frozen sections applies.
Drivers must be vigilant, especially on the less frequent roads in the Šumava region.
Olomouc Region
Drivers travelling in the areas of the Olomouc region at altitude must now have a thick and soft snow layer on the roads.
This layer remained on the collar called "Červenohorské sedlo" and on the road towards Videlský kříž, after chemical processing operations.
Snowfall forced road maintenance personnel into the field this night; according to road services, it fell more than three centimeters in Šumperk district.
In other parts of the region, most roads are easily accessible.
"On the heights of the Šumperk district are snow debris.
Drivers moving towards Jeseník must expect to meet at the col "Červenohorské sedlo" a thick, soft snow layer "to ČTK today the head of road maintenance services in Šumperk district.
Their colleagues from the Jeseník district also visited the premises during the night; according to them, after chemical treatment, the roads are now clear and wet, even in the highest areas.
In the district of Olomouc roads are easily feasible, but in the district of Šternberk drivers should be careful in the sections in forest areas on wet roads.
Regions of Ustí nad Labem and Liberec
As of this morning, North Bohemia road maintenance services have reported several difficult sections.
Data from the police show that in addition to some snow-covered or frozen places, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice na Ústecku is closed.
The temperatures will remain below zero at lower altitude, and so the snow and the ice should remain on the roads. In the plains, especially in the south east of the Central Plateau of Bohemia, there is, on the contrary, no problem and the roads are generally dry.
No traffic difficulties have been reported at the moment.
The road maintenance services reported the presence of verglas, particularly around Štětí.
According to meteorologists, night conditions were ideal for its formation: rain and melting snow during the day, clear sky and frost during the night.
Since the main road lines, difficult conditions on national road 13 at the border between the regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec have also been reported.
The closure of the movement between Telnice and Kninice is due to branches of trees that have bent under the weight of the snow until it reaches the pavement.
Šimon Ornest said: "In concert, we want to collect positive energy."
What do you think about the fact that in less than a month this should be the end of the world?
It's just one of these alarming news, the kind of traps we love to fall into.
In our group The Tap Tap, we laugh at it rather than say that we are the only group capable of collecting a positive energy supply to push back or prevent the end of the world.
In addition, in December you set up a completely unique project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you give this project more details to our readers?
It is a charitable action that we have been preparing for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Maya calendar announced for December 21 at 11 a.m. 10 a.m.
On 20 December, three concerts will take place simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will almost end at the end of the Maya calendar on the island of Kiribati in the peaceful ocean, on a 12-hour time zone ahead of us.
Who had that idea?
At first I think it was my idea, then we designed everything with our creator, Honza Augusta.
Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want together, with the public, to think about the state of the world that we leave to our children.
At the end of the Maya calendar, we created a collection of unique objects, including shoes, T-shirts, bags, and original keys against the end of the world, buying them online at www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The Tap Tap group with other performers also recorded a hymn against the end of the world called "End of the cancelled world " (in Czech " Konec světa zrušeno").
It is already very popular on YouTube, will we hear it at these charitable concerts too?
Of course, at the end, finally, if we succeed and that the end of the world does not take place...
It will be sung simultaneously by all performers in all three concerts.
The anthems will also join at some point in an on-line broadcast, quite unique, of Czech television.
The words of this song were written by Tomáš Hanák who also plays the main role of Jesus in the clip, Xindl X also sings...
How did you come to cooperate with them?
We collaborate with other personalities of the Czech biz show, due to the fact that we organize the many concerts and charitable events...
We are striving to get them to participate intensively in these projects.
It turned out that most of them are interested in such cooperation and that it amuses them.
What will benefit these concerts against the end of the world?
To equip the Studeo Training Centre, which is accessible to people with reduced mobility and which we have been working on within the Jedlička Institute, with the Tap Association, for six years.
Teachers regularly visit students at Jedličkčv Institute and offer them activities that interest them and amuse them.
Students themselves do not have the means to go to classes, we try to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedlička Institute, we will transfer this project to a new independent building.
Will several music groups and performers be on stage at each of these concerts?
By what criteria do you choose?
We have tried to develop a program for all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, they will be on stage Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
All details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Are you also preparing for other "mega events" like this in the future?
In May, we will play for the first time in the spring of Prague; there too, we will certainly prepare a quality program with interesting guests.
We would also like to play next year at the Czech Republic's home in New York and personally, once in the United States, I would like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimalist, so far you have played for example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group composed of persons with disabilities.
How do you manage the organization and logistics of your tours?
It's not so terrible that it looks like it's in the first place.
We have five members in an electric chair whose equipment must travel in the trunk, of course we also ride a lot of luggage and instrument boxes....
So far it's been more or less well done, ČSA and British Airways were always perfectly prepared for us, they surprised me more than once.
Even in Moscow, where we came from recently, everything went smoothly.
Thanks to your travel abroad, you can compare how these countries differ in terms of access facilities for people with reduced mobility, the attitude of public opinion towards people with disabilities and so on.
What have you had so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than at home, we were just witnesses in Moscow that to the east is still only in an initial phase.
In relation to Prague, Moscow is still very little accessible to persons with disabilities; there it is not yet common for a person to move alone in an electric chair in the center of the city.
They do not yet see evidence of giving priority to a person in a wheelchair in an elevator.
Fortunately, there too, an association trying to draw attention to the problems of persons with disabilities is being created.
What more must we catch up with the more developed countries?
There's a lot for which we're still late...
It is important to mention that improvements and improvements are still dependent on the efforts of those concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common that people with a heavy disability move alone in public spaces; they can go to the toilets, to the museum, anywhere...
It is still not very common there that many people with disabilities are actively involved in social life, on this point, you, The Tap Tap, are rather the opposite of the point of progress!
Respect for the public and access facilities are one thing, but the situation will really start to change when we have sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or famous lawyers among us.
For the time being, these are only isolated cases of people who have strong will.
The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, let's go back a few years, what prompted you in 1998 to create this group?
I started working as an educator at Jedlička Institute, where I found myself surrounded by many young people ready to invest in something.
And since I am myself a musician (I play, among other things, a saxophone), with a colleague, we created a music activity.
And then, over time, as our moderator Lá sound Angelovič says, we have lost a little control of the situation (laughs).
Success has only happened in recent years, if I'm not mistaken?
It is true that creating links with known singers and working actively to promote the group helped us.
We understood that, if a job is not visible, it is as if it did not exist in the background.
Thanks to European Union grants, we can also allow ourselves to have quality teachers, equipment, and so on.
Did you have the goal of reaching such a level with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt there was a potential to change things.
The show business is full of things that copy each other.
In a way, it makes sense: everything new is accepted with caution and it lasts for a long time.
Rare are the original projects, and I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is naturally pity, it is natural ...
But pity is totally useless, because people with disabilities are not suffering beings, abandoned by all, which we must take in pity.
They are people who can live a whole life and thrive, provided they have the necessary means of it, of course.
I often say that when people with disabilities come to realize something, it is not only an advance for them but for society as a whole.
Is not your success also due to the fact that you are a demanding leader, as you are qualified by many people?
If we want to do quality work, we must be intransigent in many areas and require some discipline.
But I think it's quite normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and, when they realize that they must come to rehearsals twice a week, follow the preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the roads for concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But it works the same way in each group that wants to work and achieve goals.
The Tap Tap group currently has twenty members.
How many of them were already there in 1998?
Only one, Láän Angelovič.
We're an open group, people go in and out, we can't do anything.
Our doors are always open to those who want or would like to join us.
This will be the case on the day before the end of the world, on Thursday, December 20, 2012 from 9 p.m.
This action will take place in Prague in the Incheba Arena, in Brno in Fleda and in Ostrava in Plynojem with the participation of twelve groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic.
At the end of the evening, these three cities will be connected by audiovisual relay when the song of the group The Tap Tap " End of the Cancelled World " will be sung together.
The aim of the concert is to gather financial resources (up to 25 million CZK) to equip the Studeo multifunctional training centre in Prague at Jedlička Institute.
The price of a ticket at this concert is 400 CZK, the entrance is free for children up to 12 years old, the ticket presale is open in Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of the Ministers of the European Space Agency countries, Poland was admitted as the twentieth member of this agency, it was the second Member State of the former Eastern bloc (the Czech Republic became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland had been working closely with ESA in 1994 and in subsequent years participated in a number of Agency projects.
However, the road from Poland to space began much earlier.
Already before the Second World War, passionate Poles worked on space flights; they did not always find understanding.
For example, I would like to refer to A. Šternfeld's conference at the Warsaw astronomical observatory on 6 December 1933, during which he presented ideas drawn from his avant-garde work entitled "Introduction to Astroutics ".
The developments of this young engineer (born 1905) left the listeners cold and years later Šternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld earned in France the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch prize for his work "Introduction à l'astroutique".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great propagator of astronomy and astronomy.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish newspapers and wrote many books devoted to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a world-renowned astronomical propagator, his contribution was rewarded in particular by the fact that his name was given to one of the craters on the hidden side of the Moon.
From 1925 it was built in Poland a root for use with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, neither the author nor the details of this project are known.
It is also unclear whether the rocket should be used to propel or brake the root.
The only known information on this root is that of the press of the time.
Starting in 1933, the Polish artillery began to dedicate itself to rockets.
The research was conducted by Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in collaboration with Professors Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustav Mokrzyckiego.
It appears from the records that this research had reached the test stage.
Of course, with the arrival of the German armies, research has ceased.
In 1937, the plans of a photo-hunting rocket, designed by engineer Rohoziński, appeared in the specialized press and the following year published the book "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by an author named Leliwy-Krzywoblocki.
The purpose of these two projects was military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, all the projects for the use of rocket technology were carried out by the Provisional Scientific Advisory Committee ("Tymczasowy Committee and Doradczo-Naukowy"), which coordinated all the work.
This committee was established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the beginning of the war ended its activities.
After the war, other works dedicated to aviation were published in the Polish press, thanks to Polish astronomical society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, it is a question of a company in the November 1954 issue of the Journal Problem, in which there are four more detailed articles devoted to aeronautics.
In one of these articles, written by Professor Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a society dedicated to astronomy
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was clear that the area of space research had a future.
At the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) made efforts to enter the international Astronautical Federation (created in 1951) and as of autumn, the PTA became a regular member.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became vice president of the international astronomical federation.
He remained in office until his death in 1959.
Starting in 1956, the PTA made a significant contribution to the successful development of the RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna) meteorological rocket, which became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on 10 October 1958.
This rocket with a range of 1800 metres was 80 cm long and weighed a little less than 5 kg.
Subsequently, an improved version was constructed, RM-1A and during the summer of 1959, flight tests of the two-storey RM-2 rocket were started in the Bledov Desert.
This rocket was 1.4 metre long and probably weighed 11.5 kg.
The following prototype should have been able to perform concrete scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should have had a range of up to 14.5 km and be used to observe the wind at altitude.
But in 1963, all development work was stopped.
The Meteor-1 rocket developed during the period 1962 - 1965 succeeds in the first MRI-type rockets.
This rocket, designed with two floors, had a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models (known as Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed and distinguished by the dimensions of the space reserved for scientific tools.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a space with a volume of 0.4 litres, while in Meteor-1B this volume was 0.34 litres and in Meteor-1C it was 0.62 litres.
The maximum range of all types of equipment was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 rockets were developed in the aeronautical institute, and the first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a useful load of 10 kg at an altitude of approximately 60 km.
Subsequently, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
The entry of Poland to COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the establishment of a national committee COSPAR two years later should be mentioned.
As part of the Interkosmos programme, Poland also participated in space exploration on artificial Soviet satellites and in 1978 the Miroslaw Hermaszewski pilot became, after Vladimir Remek, the second non-Soviet cosmonaut of this programme.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the Public Works Act.
This decision raised a serious debate in public opinion.
It is undoubtedly interesting to examine this issue from a broader point of view.
Liberalism-oriented economic systems, both in the EU and in the context of globalization, are based on the principle of more unregulated economic competition.
This means that the different economic entities and national economic systems are continually in conflict with each other.
This is the result of the principle of freedom of trade and free movement (without limits) of private capital associated with a frightening financial speculation.
The considerable differences in the labour price (wages) generate pressure on prices.
The following meaning must be put to the end: a producer strives to import goods sold at low prices to resist economic competition by "making the price more expensive" of the competitor, with the aim of removing a larger share of the market and thereby increasing its own profits.
On a large scale, this means for most entrepreneurs: either to transfer production abroad, to buy cheaply or to disappear; the result is a significant unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and therefore responsibility for unemployment it generates, the social burdens of the State are necessarily increasing.
All of this reinforces the perfect will of gentlemen to pay taxes and thus compensate for the economic and social damage caused to society as a whole by this race for profit.
This situation is at such a public level that it is not necessary to provide concrete statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital create in the different economies a situation in which governments of different countries are forced to engage in mutual competition in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital to them.
In other words, governments place their own people at the expense of private capital without taking into account the social collapse.
This is reflected primarily in the amendments to the laws in force.
The objective is to compel its own population economically to accept the private capital price dictatorship, particularly in the field of wages.
This occurs on the one hand by a system of economic constraints in the event of long-term unemployment, and on the other by the restriction of workers' rights in the field of labour law.
This results in increasing poverty and deepening the gap between the rich and the poor.
In AFR, there have been public food distribution points for the poor for years that cannot meet their needs with their own work.
There are already millions of these people.
As part of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, it becomes quite common for employees to receive such wages that the State is obliged to pay an additional fee to achieve the minimum vital.
Such scandal has, for example, been updated in the case of employees working as auxiliary workers in the federal parliament.
The economic measures of almost all the Member States in the south of the EU undoubtedly generate a similar situation in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced either to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century), or to live with wages of misery, on the margins of society, in the hope that private capital will eventually invest in their country.
The question must be asked here: where does this capital come from?
If it comes from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another; this capital may not come either, or then a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, a Turkish, a Moroccan, an Egyptian or African will continue to work for a fraction of a European wage.
This also applies to all Latin America.
The liberal theory and the media claim, to be discouraged, that the state cannot make capital investments in its own economy, that the managed economy leads to an economic disaster.
Private capital strongly supports the idea that the State cannot intervene in the economy through regulatory interventions.
The question then arises whether private capital does not influence and, even today, does not, according to its own selfish interests, govern politics and the whole state.
The answer to this question is no doubt yes.
The evidence is that there is a lobby that is practically all-powerful and present in all States.
This results in a desperate situation in the area of corruption, by granting mutual benefits, in legislation, where everything is condemned but not punishable.
In AFR, the situation is such that due to the lack of financial resources, national departments delegate the development of bills to law firms closely related to the industry.
These bills were then passed at the Bundestag.
The whole power comes not from the people, as declared by the Western constitutions, but from powerful financial groups serving their own interests.
It is clear that liberalism-oriented democracies are now faced quickly with the situation described by Appianos in his book entitled "the crisis of the Roman Empire in the time of Caesar and Pompeii": "The state had long been in full delicacy and the functions were attributed by violence.
Cups of wine, favors obtained illegally, and stones and swords were also used to obtain these positions.
The under-tables and corruption proliferated without limits and the people went to the elections with voices already sold" ... ... "The honest people were not trying to get any functions, it turns out once the state remained eight months without consular."... 'We really began to say that the remedy to this difficult situation was an autocracy and that we had to choose an energetic man"... It is true that Appianos had in mind Pompée, but it was Caesar who irreversibly turned democracy into an absoluteist regime.
In conclusion, as in antiquity, the present society is based on the preference of personal profit, without regard for the interests of society as a whole.
In its essence, private capital is no longer able to understand and defend the interests of society as a whole.
Today, as in the past, this results in an unprecedented decline of elites, without any effort to carry out deep reforms.
We must therefore look for the causes of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in the unscrupulous liberalization of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
In the present state of affairs, the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of liberal-type democracies can be seen as a sort of break before a new stage.
The fact that current elites are totally unaware of the eventuality of hundreds of thousands of future losses in human lives, the humanitarian and social crises that we are now witnesses and the crimes against humanity as we know them from ancient and recent history.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution, at least in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both internationally and at European internal level, the Government of the Czech Republic will continue to seek ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is systemic indeed.
The solution consists of socio-political reforms, which will strengthen State capital investments in the economy, increase citizens' influence on government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the State.
Israel: laboratory of chaos.
"Nothing will ever come out of violence and never will" says Sting in the song called Fragile whose main verse of the refrain is "let's not forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons did not want war, there would be no war," said Gutele Schnaper, Mayer's wife Amschel Rothschild on his deathbed in 1849.
As a result of the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, many reactions have been raised.
Some take the party of Israel, arguing for its right to self-defence and placing Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others support Palestinians, invoking the racism of the State of Israel, the genocide committed against the Arabs of Palestine and considering Israel as a terrorist State.
I do not want to think about the question of who is guilty and who is victims, in his waves of recurrent killings; all the sum, the current inhabitants of Israel, including those of the autonomous territories, were born in this political situation and did not experience the beginning of violence.
I would like to offer readers a point of view "backward the curtain", on the one to which they mainly benefit from the tensions that have already lasted for over 95 years (as from the Balfour declaration in 1917) in a small part of the Middle East.
Some of these reflections are based on historical facts available in the study, others emerge from my own understanding of the one, or more precisely from the group of individuals, which is the main instigator of events in modern history.
The history of humanity is above all the history of a struggle for power.
At each time, we can find an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether these individuals acted independently or were obliged to act on the throne to someone who was directing their actions on the basis of previously defined objectives.
We must admit that we live at a time when world wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this financial concentration generating certain powers has not been able to take place during a single generation.
Among families with astronomical wealth, the Rothschild family is particularly distinguished, which could be considered the head of the pepper (I don't know if these families still have a leader but I don't exclude it).
It's hardly written about them.
Of course.
From the 1990s to the 19th century, they acquired the first world press agency (Reuters) to put an end to establishing links between their names and serious criminal acts to which they were involved and which had always meant strengthening their power, increasing their fortune or both.
They have major stakes in almost most central banks of the world and prepare or carry out wars against countries in which they have not yet had such shares (before the invasion of Afghanistan the number of these countries was 7, after the invasion of Iraq of 5, after the overthrow of Kadhafi only of 4, in the meantime Russia placed the Russian central bank under the control of the Russian government).
Anyone who tried to stand up against this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of a central bank at the Rothschild Bank of America and began to issue his own money (government, I understand it) during the civil war and was murdered in a theatre in 1865.
JFK began to issue clean money and wanted to dissolve the EDF, he was murdered in 1963, and MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 while he wanted to bring a trial against the EDF for having triggered the great economic crisis of 1929.
Their thirst for world power led in the years 1859 to 1871 to the formulation of a three-world war plan by Albert Pike, a freemason initiated at the 33rd degree, being the highest level.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great state monarchies of Europe, the second was to eliminate colonialism, particularly Britain, and the third was to reduce the world's population from 1 to 0.5 billion individuals (such a number of slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort), create a single universal religion (ecumenism being nothing but the beginning of such a solution) and ultimately acquire absolute power.
The method used by the clan of the richest families with their heads the Rothschilds is to create a crisis and then propose a solution (order ab chaos - order according to chaos).
These solutions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the creation of the EDF aimed at preventing the recurrence of crises such as those caused in 1907).
After succeeding in triggering the first world war by the assassination in Sarajevo of Ferdinand, heir to the Austrian-Hungarian throne, they destroyed Tsarist Russia by provoking the Bolshevik revolution.
The first world war ended suddenly with a German capitulation without economic and military justification (war was no longer necessary for the destruction of Tsarist Russia) and was followed by the fragmentation of Austria-Hungary, the power of Central Europe.
For an easier start to the Second World War, the bankers allowed politicians to create a situation of latent conflict: they have imposed on Germany far-reaching war reparations thereby generating the conditions of radicalization of the impoverished masses (then enough for them to place a sufficiently energetic leader, showing the finger of the perpetrators, proposing simple solutions) and, on the other hand, they created a Czechoslovakia consisting of different nationalities, including a strong German minority who had to play the role (which they actually held) of the fifth column to set fire to the dusts and trigger a war.
By the end of the 19th century, the Rothschields inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, one of which aspires to the creation of a Jewish State, preferably in the region of historical Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour declaration mentioned above laid the foundations for a massive emigration of Jews to Palestine and the first frictions with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist acts were committed on both sides.
The second world war broke out; it is difficult to appreciate whether Hitler broke the chains in which international bankers had originally held it; or if everything he did was planned, the fact is, however, that the suffering of the Jews of Europe in the concentration camps created the basis for the acceptance of a Jewish State by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948; just as the war repairs imposed on Germany were the origin of the Second World War, the foundation of the State of Israel lit a firehouse that could lead to a third world war.
If international bankers succeed in triggering this war, the Jewish population will be as it was during the Second World War, the first victim of the fighting, this time as well as the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a vast laboratory, the source of discord and chaos, not only in this country, but at the international level (just to see how people divide sharply between supporters and defenders of Israel).
Who is guilty and who is victim of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where one wrong generates another wrong according to a circle of endless violence and where, at the origin of everything, there is the greed of some individuals and their desire to acquire power over the whole world?
We need to make a difference here between the simple citizens of Israel and their leaders, because, as we do, international bankers offer people only their own candidates to the elections.
The current Prime Minister of Israel is a typical example of a fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, who is doing everything to trigger a war with Iran, which could, because of its accession to the Shanghai cooperation organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc.) expand to become a global conflict and, since Iran controls the Ormuz Strait through which 20% of the world's oil flows (this naval corridor is only 2 miles wide) and leads to the destruction of the world economy.
What light is now being shed on David Rockefeller's statement in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order."
In their idea, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which a handful of aristocrats of finance is served by the rest of the human population.
A world in which every new born is implanted at birth an electronic chip making it a totally controlled being.
"Let them compel all individuals, small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves to carry a red iron mark on their hands or forehead, so that they can neither buy nor sell the one who does not bear the name of this ferocious beast or the number of his name.
It must be understood that the one who has good sense takes into account the figures of this ferocious beast.
This number means the man and it's six hundred and sixty six."
The film Argo: When everything goes wrong, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a number of demonstrators made up of Islamic students attacked the American Embassy of Tehran and held 52 diplomats hostages.
They were to be released in exchange for Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled to the United States after the revolution, who had supported his regime for decades.
The situation did not offer the U.S. administration a positive outcome, and it could not, in fact, abandon the Shah, because it would have seriously disturbed the confidence of its allies in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was unable to obtain the release of hostages.
It was a hard blow to the prestige of the United States, further aggravated by the fiasco of the attempt to release hostages by force.
The kidnapped diplomats were finally released 444 days later, following negotiations organized by the Algerian government.
Their fate is a wave of solidarity and an anti-Iranian feeling in the United States.
The Iranian Debacle contributed heavily to Jimmy Carter's defeat of Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film Argo, by actor and director Ben Affleck, describes an episode of this story that offered a small victory to America.
Just before she was occupied, six employees escaped from the embassy.
After complicated peripeties, they found themselves in the residence of the ambassador of Canada.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to get them out of Iran with a rock cover: they left the country with Canadian passports as members of a shooting team that came to make screenings for the shooting of a major science-fiction film.
Gender Combination
The exfiltration expert Tony Mendez's plan requires Hollywood's collaboration.
In order to make the legend more credible, specialized stores reported on this film project, press conferences were organized and a fictional production company had real offices.
The details of the operation remained secret for a long time, with the film based on Tony Mendez's memories.
Affleck's film is an unusual combination of several genres.
This is on the one hand a political thriller designed in a realistic way but also a "caper movie", the story of a successful hit, a betrayal - such as in the trilogy Ocean's elevent, twelve and tirteen.
The ambiances succeed: sequences of Teheran of documentary style (in the subtitled sequences are presented iconic photographs of the time of events and how, thanks to these photographs, these same situations have been retransscribed in the film, there are no major differences),
lighter passages of Hollywood, treated with irony and a little exaggeration,
and then scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions with men dressed up discussing the situation around conference tables, corridors and telephone...
Ben Affleck managed to restart his career in a remarkable way.
As a ridiculed actor, he became a respected director and his acting game stopped raising ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after the dark police officer " Gone Baby Gone " (2007) and the thriller "The town" (2010).
It's also Affleck's first film that doesn't take place in his home town, Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of a place is one of the characteristics that placed its first films above Hollywood standards.
Affleck also demonstrates this sense of atmosphere in Argo where Tehran's role "is held" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, during the reconstruction of real facts; the initial sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive by its clarity, which also suggests the confusion and unpredictableness when suddenly, in a given place, a page of history is written.
Affleck and his collaborators have a similar effect on the fictional scenes (the fake shooting team in the Tehran bazaar).
Too many actions in too many locations
The director had to be content with a subject that actually offered only a few palpitating scenes, in the cinematographic sense of the term.
It goes well, it sometimes adds some elements to reality and there, the result is not always as elegant (the scene in which the threat of crisis at Tehran airport is driven away by a phone call in America and the pursuit on the landing track is sufficiently fired by the hair).
Argo's weakness lies in its dissipated nature, due to the need to show too many events to too many different places.
If it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are quite charming in their role as Hollywood cooperatives, their characters would have deserved a bigger place and they are not, far from it, the only ones in this case.
Affleck's film lacks some dramatic tension, it is seen with moderate interest, appreciating the realization and retro style of the 1970s.
He trains the viewer, but with difficulty.
As a reminder of yet another history, in a certain way unfinished to this day, and as an illustration of the exaggerated character of the representation of secret services as omnipotent and omniscient, he does the matter.
Rules for Inflating Balloons, Bananas and Circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which conducts an annual public inquiry into the most absurd bank charges, has now decided to launch the competition of the regulation or ideas from the most absurd "EU workshop".
"The fact that the EU has been planning, in recent times, to adopt a quota of 40 percent of women for the management of large European enterprises has been the origin of our decision," said the organizer of this survey, Patrik Nacher, for the newspaper Právo.
Among the nonsense mentioned, there is already, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify insurance premiums for men and women.
Until now, however, women had benefited from life insurance tariffs because they objectively represent a lower risk for insurance companies.
People can report until the end of the year any other such incredible idea of "the EU workshop".
"The vote will take place before the end of February 2013," Nacher said.
Among the controversial EU regulations, for example, are the obligation to add bio components to fuels, which has harmful consequences for the environment, or the prohibition to use reliable mercury thermometers only because they contain a relatively small amount of a dangerous substance or the Directive on the size of chicken cages, which has led to an increase in egg prices.
Critics have also been issued in the past against the de facto prohibition of using the term "buy to tartinate" or the withdrawal of the sale of conventional bulbs.
Quality bananas must be 14 cm in size.
The European administration often reacts under pressure from a commercial or industrial lobby whose applications are usually defended in Brussels by a State or group of States (now the Czech Republic imposes the requests of its banks by threatening to use its veto right).
The interests of the pressure groups are also, for example, the reason why bananas in the Union should not be less than 14 cm in size or have an "abnormal curve".
The European Commission defended itself by arguing that it was only harmonising non- homogenous national standards that complicated trade.
Standards for fruit and vegetables have been relaxed despite the opposition of some States, claiming that existing directives result in food waste.
The first prize may be awarded in this survey to the EU regulation last year that there must be a warning on inflatable balloons that children under the age of 8 should not be inflated without adult supervision.
The EU referred to an American survey that among toys balloons are the first cause of death of children by suffocation.
A similar restriction applies to children under 14 years of age with regard to blowing in live trumpets.
In our case too, we have strange ideas.
The following rule concerning European officials themselves is quite absurd: because of the sensitivity of this theme for Greece, anyone who has an official function within the EU cannot use the name "Macedonian" and should instead speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with the Association "Let Do" bringing together liberal economists, the Bankovnípoplatky.com server appointed in this investigation, in addition to some of the absurdities mentioned above, the Union Regulation on the volume of food reserves in the territory of the Czech Republic.
The EU had set maximum volumes for food reserves that could be found on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the volumes fixed for canned mushrooms and therefore risked a heavy fine.
The organizers of this survey found it interesting to pay money to some countries because they do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a subsidy to apply for subsidies.
However, these ideas are not from Brussels but from Prague.
"The fact that we don't have a sea makes us handicapped.
We will ask the European Union for a refund." Thus, in the fall of 2004, the Minister of Agriculture of the time Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) was expressed.
He argued that, as a result of our wheat production, and as a result of the so-called interventionist purchases, the State had met with full stocks that it had then had to export.
According to Palas, the EU should have paid us millions of euros because the Czech Republic is far from ports.
Finally, the European Commission responded positively to the Czech demand and organised a call for tenders for the purchase of wheat from countries without maritime access.
Grants for grants were proposed to municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development led by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), which were specifically intended to be used to prepare applications for grants granted by Brussels.
The EU states: "unusual regulations are rare".
While the regulations often cause criticism in the Member States, according to many experts, the EU's efforts in regulating and improving the effectiveness of the functioning of the Union and in the field of its overall development deserve more praise.
More serious is, for example, the problem of using EU grants for projects which have absolutely nothing to do with strengthening European integration, but which have been imposed by the Member States during the budgetary negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic, like other countries of the Union, has to fight in Brussels for the right to use specific names for these traditional products (the fight it does not always win) is a source of strong emotions in the Czechs.
If at the end of six years of battle against the Germans and Austrians, the Czechs successfully defended the name "Olomucké tvarěžky", for the term "Tuzemský rum" that dates back to us in the 19th century, our producers had to replace it with the term "Tuzemák".
Only cane sugar based products, not beet sugar, can bear the name rum.
In the official list of EU registered products, Karlovy Vary's biscuits ("Karlovarské suchary"), Pohořelice's carpes and Třeboň ("Pohořelický a Třebočský kapr") and Žatec's houblon ("Žatecký chmel") are now found in the official list of EU registered products.
Pardubice's spice bread ("Pardubický perník") and cakes called "Hořice cornets" ("hořické trubičky") can also be proud of their community brand.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur, Senator Okamura says
Mr. Senator, how is it that we have the idea of presenting ourselves to the presidential elections?
It's not about being a senator or president that counts for me.
If everything worked smoothly in our country, I wouldn't be a candidate anywhere.
But I can't bear to see how the country has been looted for the past twenty years, that thieves are not under locks and taxes and retirement age are increasing.
I had no ambition to become a politician.
But when I see something that doesn't please me, then I try to bring a solution for it to change.
And since I am over forty years old and that I am independent, a member of no party, I have no other solution to influence the situation than to present myself to the presidential or Senate elections.
You entered the Senate but quickly set off for the Castle (N.d.T.: Chair's seat).
Don't you turn your back on those who elected you?
I've always said I'm going to fight for the Castle according to the results of the Senate elections.
Later on, I explained that if I was elected a senator, I would present myself to the presidential elections.
My goal is not the function, this is just an instrument that allows me to realize my vision.
That is why I need the greatest influence and the greatest mandate.
The problem is not only that as a nation we are talking to the bar or in front of our television station, but also that we trample on those who are trying to bring about change.
This adds to the press that breaks people's reputation and confuses freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
For example, it has been said about me that I'm sorry for the journalists or that I was Jiří Paroubek's advisor.
Let's come to your visions.
You started the fight for the Castle with as a battle horse the themes of the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and retroactive tax returns beyond twenty million [CZK].
You have to change the law for this purpose.
As President, you do not have such power and only the Senate as a whole can propose legislation.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When, as a citizen, I pressed for tourism guide activities to be a liberal profession, I gained cause gain.
The problem is politics: when someone comes from the left or right with a good project, it is deliberately rejected and it delays the citizens.
As an independent member of no party, I am much more likely to get support from all parliamentary parties.
I have the advantage of being able, without categorization and dogma, to take from each party what is best for our country and implement it.
Do you consider yourself to be a man on the right or on the left?
From a Czech point of view, I feel like people are putting me on the left.
For me, whether it's a little left or right, it's not really important.
For me, the important thing is that we went ahead.
What matters to me is not that people are on the left or on the right, but that they gather people together.
I always support any solution contributing to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party or ODS and I am acting equally impartially against bad ideas.
Are you angry when someone says you're a populist?
But what you said doesn't prove it?
When you develop a business plan in a business, you also have a certain optimal purpose and vision.
You're trying to get closer.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I'm talking about have been applied around the world and recognized experts have talked about it.
But without Parliament's support, you're left with slogans.
You will not survive long in politics with this.
Do you think that if you go see people and talk to them, you will be able, for example, to impose physical and criminal responsibility?
I don't have another option.
I need to convince politicians, journalists and public opinion and try to rally them to my camp in order to impose it.
If I was elected President, it would not be a problem to broadcast on-line my request to the presidents of the parliamentary parties to legislate on the material and criminal responsibility of politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
They should then possibly explain why they do not want it.
When there is a strong personality that will identify abuse, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take, for example, the election of the President to direct suffrage, it was obtained thanks to pressure from public opinion.
I admit, without ambition, to be an amateur, not a genius or an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my opinions and visions.
I have just started into politics and I am trying to get the majority support for my programme.
I'm trying, alone, to move things forward, and if it doesn't work, I'll stop in six years and go back to the private sector.
It's a bit like Okamura had to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a rescuer.
I know that one person cannot make a difference, which is why I went to see a number of personalities to ask them to also present themselves to the Senate elections.
I met Radim Jančura, but he refused because of the amount of work.
At least I supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová who revealed fraud in oil.
I showed up because people are really unhappy, but now I hesitate.
Sixty percent of the people did not vote and what they did most gave their voice to a representative of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independents.
People elected a Senate that could hardly impose changes.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example the direct election of mayors and prefects of regions.
Are you considering founding your own party?
No, not yet, because I don't have time to check whether the past of each potential member is spotless and then I don't have the financial means.
I also have no money for my presidential campaign, I only have twenty thousand on my "transparent" account.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about tax returns, what's yours?
I value about 60 million of my personal property.
I have in Prague a land worth 25 million, an apartment worth 10 million, another apartment worth 8 million, a collection of works of art worth about 10 million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb worth 1 million and a few million on my account.
Or say by the way, I own an Aston Martin, because it was a boy's dream: I always loved James Bond, who was driving, was gallant with women and fought against evil and abuse.
You ride in Aston Martin, you have a heritage worth 60 million and you don't have any money for your campaign?
You want to change the Republic but you don't want to invest your own money there?
It's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for this campaign.
Should I be in debt?
I've already invested two and a half million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors shows that my program is not of great interest.
I don't have to pay for this campaign from my pocket.
My campaign expenses are generally covered by the remuneration I will receive as a senator.
But I couldn't live by, for example, paying my son's English school that costs 30 thousand a month.
If my only goal was to earn money, I'm not going to stand for any election.
So you're going to continue your commercial activities so you can live?
Didn't you say you'd put your activities in the dark?
But this is not related to the amount of this remuneration.
As I promised, I partially reduced my activities.
For example, my deputy will take the direction of the travel agency in the spring.
People would like me to be a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I have to live with something.
What was your usual monthly salary when you were an entrepreneur?
I was winning and still winning between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If I was president, I would end my business.

The architects of the MVRDV cabinet prove that true adventures are not just a matter of imagination. To convince themselves, just contemplate Spijkenisse and the newly erected mountain of books - 2 photos
"I think this building is funny, it makes it very futuristic, finally something interesting to see," Lisette Verhaig, a passerby on the bottom of the street, tells us.
Stefan Spermon, a computerist in a large neighbouring company, tells us, "Yes, he's really nice, this building."
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
Everyone has Internet, an iPad and e-books.
Today, no one goes any further than that in one of these wide-ranging libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a sleeping town that has nothing attractive at the doors of Rotterdam, holds a quite special record.
The municipality of 80,000 souls shows the lowest education rate in the Netherlands.
In order to restore some neurons to the brains, the city decided a few years ago to contribute to the general culture and to reproduce the seven fictitious bridges that appear on the euro banknotes in the form of beautiful small miniatures in painted reinforced concrete.
The success of the cultural offensive remained limited.
This is how the city authorities realized that there was only one way to get back to the statistics: building a library!
Winy Maas, from Rotterdam MVRDV's architect's office, master of bold and spirit-filled building diagrams, accepted the project with its usual flexage and presented in 2003 with five books under his arm and a wink on his face.
And while the members of the jury were still looking, puzzled and lifting their shoulders, Maas, the confronted, stacked his books of choice in order of size to make a pyramid, and ended his discourse backed up by activist arguments by one: "common auction!"
Here it is, my proposal for the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, or as we say, the Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain of 30 million euros fell to the ground.
The building is part of a revitalization project including an underground parking lot, a supermarket, a post office and a few buildings and houses for a total of 50 dwellings.
Early in November, the mountain of books received the second award "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project was selected for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
Thus, this small, tender village, which until now had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and a city hall of an aghast laideur, whose white facades invite to think that they shelter a dairy, has been enriched by a contemporary architectural work.
The most important thing is that Spijkenisse now owns the first public cultural building in its history.
The Long Path to Reading
First impression: Eldorado of the book under cheese bell.
Certainly, an elevator takes you to the heart of the massif, but the real joys of reading and architecture open up to you when you crowd the floor of the building to discover its topography.
The interior entirely made of glass is bright and clear, the Dutch brick floor and elegant verbs speak unequivocally the language of the municipal public squares.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
We're already looking at public benches, dogs and little boys and girls who play ball.
And everywhere books, books and books.
"Usually, library beams are located along the facade and in the middle there is a large and dark room, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal," Willy Maas explains.
We have completely overturned the classic spatial configuration and opened the reading spaces from the inside to the outside.
The interior of the mountain of books has been properly furnished: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the centre for the environment and the building's technical center.
A particular beauty lies in the black rays of the library, which are sometimes of the slabs, sometimes of the balustrades, sometimes of the stairway ramps.
A new experience for sight, touch and smell.
Even the architects and engineers of the hardened building do not want unknown materials.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," explains Joop Trouborst, project leader in the municipality of Spijkenisse, in a response to the Standard.
This is how one day we found in an agricultural company ad hoc waste comes from agriculture.
In the Netherlands, the synthetic membrane of one millimeter thick has been used for years as substrate in the greenhouses and fields.
It's cheap and we get time.
The fine membrane is used for one or two seasons, then it can be discarded.
For the library, the membrane was compressed, for the first time in such quantities, into plates of a thickness of four centimeters.
Under the effect of heat and pressure, the "Landbouwplastic" (KPL) changes color and becomes a dark, homogeneous and resistant material, the smell of which evokes both a new car and sports shoes.
Top of the 105 steps is the top of the mountain.
At the end of almost 500 metres, the literary coffee offers a stunning view of the city, as well as Dutch croquettes and figus pots.
The latter create an atmosphere, but they mainly contribute to maintaining the ideal level of moisture in the air of the literary mountain.
Gifts for the New Soul
"It's incredible, but despite all the glass surfaces, this building is a model project on ecology," says Trouborst.
The temperature of the building is adjusted by geothermal.
Although the mountain of books is below a glass bell, the sun only illuminates the interior for a short time, even the days of good time.
The beam thickness of wood mounted across the glass facade serves as a sunscreen, intercepting a large part of the rays.
The atmosphere is very pleasant.
The fully automated stores are loaded with the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the above-mentioned septic computer scientist, has already risked entering the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
Cynthia Bogarde, professor of traditional Chinese medicine, even describes Boekenberg as "the soul finally found" by Spijkenisse.
A few weeks ago, at the inauguration, every citizen was invited to donate a book from his personal library.
This measure helped to fill the gaps in the library that were not yet fully garnished (currently, it has 70,000 pounds).
The concept is a success.
The rays overflow everywhere.
For architect Winy Maas, "there's nothing worse than a half-empty library."
"I believe that our invitation has created a certain relationship between every citizen and this new building.
Everyone knows his book is part of this building.
Even if it's only for decoration."
This is how MVRDV has reached the master's discipline, which is called, in the professional jargon, "the creation of an identity".
Spijkenisse wrote a new page of literary history.
Even if she may seem young and uneducated.
Finally, this is a new starting point for the birth of an identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a greater role."
Germany chose to abstain when voting on the admission of the Palestinian State.
According to Stephen Szabo, expert on relations between the United States and the EU, this decision puts Berlin in a delicate political situation.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had announced its intention to vote against the Palestinian demand for observer status with the United Nations.
But then she chose abstention.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not approve what Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, Berlin must exercise caution because it has special relations with Israel.
But I also think that it does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to assert its independence, however, without being overly critical of Israel.
At the insurrection in Libya in March 2011, Germany had also chosen to abstain when voting on the establishment of an air exclusion zone.
Finally, NATO imposed this measure.
Is Germany experiencing difficulties in adopting a clear position on major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason for this is that Berlin is reviewing its foreign policy, seeking to move away from a policy, so to speak, defined by the Americans and to establish a German foreign policy.
Furthermore, the lack of coherent and common policy within the Union complicates the situation.
The Germans are therefore facing several fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they're still trying to find this role, but they're on the path to a "more normal" foreign policy.
An external policy, such as in France or Great Britain
What, then, does the term "normal" foreign policy mean for Germans?
It shows the willingness to adopt positions independent of those of the United States and European partners, including with regard to national files.
I believe that German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, so by exports and relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Near East.
German economic interests are to some extent different from those of other major powers: that is why Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced Germany's position towards the Middle East conflict and the abstention in the United Nations vote?
Germany first has important opportunities in the Near East, especially in the Gulf countries.
That is why Berlin must be careful not to undermine public opinion, but also the elites of Arab countries.
This is undoubtedly a key element.
However, I would not attach too much importance to this, because it is not a purely unilateral relationship.
But this is in any case a key element in German strategic thinking.
Does Germany damage its relations with the United States by choosing to abstain from important votes, as in the case of Palestine?
I believe that Europeans and Americans fully understand the German position.
That is why I think the fracture is not so serious that it was in the case of the Libyan question.
Perhaps even Germany will be more respected.
Germany has thus shown that it must be taken seriously as an international actor and that its interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, views on the Palestinian initiative are diverse.
On the other hand, the United States has announced its veto with a clear voice.
Do opinions differ between the United States and the majority of European countries?
There have always been differences due to the American domestic political scene.
I believe that the Obama Administration shows a secret understanding of the European position.
But given the political configuration of the country, the government cannot, of course, defend its position publicly.
I believe that the real differences of opinion are not so great that they always seem to be.
If you look at the relations between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahou, you will notice that Obama is far from overwhelmingly enthusiastic about Netanyahou's policy.
Does Germany experience difficulties in reconciling its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of the major European partners on the other?
I don't think it makes things easier for Germans.
Of course, it would be a little simpler for Germans if there was a coherent and uniform European policy, but today that is not the case.
They cannot therefore join a broader political line and must affirm their unique position.
This is what they are doing now in the euro issue.
In my opinion, Germany will take on a locomotive role in the future and encourage Europe to adopt a European position.
It is not easy for Germany, particularly because of relations with Israel.
This issue has always been sensitive.
But in my view, the Germans are well aware that they must play a role that marks their independence more.
Does Germany see itself as a major player on the international stage, does Germany only want to play a key role?
Or does it still have difficulty taking on leading roles?
Germany is still not used to it, it is always uncomfortable for it and, for obvious reasons, the country is still experiencing difficulties in playing a more important role.
Looking, for example, at the euro crisis, it is noted that whenever Germany decides to weigh more, many anti-German feelings are heard.
It doesn't make things easier for Germans.
In fact, this is still the same problem: we do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more delicate position than the United States.
It must be composed of very diverse neighbors and opinions, and it is not easy.
Today, the influence of the United States on European policy is only decreasing, but at this point the EU does not fill this gap, so who remains?
The Germans will simply have to play a more important role.
And even if they don't like it, even if it's unpleasant to them, and if they're just less appreciated, it's life!
Stephen Szabo is the Deputy Director of the Transatlantic Academy of Washington, an institute where academics and policy experts from Europe and North America jointly analyse the challenges of the transatlantic community.
Szabo is also a member of the German Marshall Fund, where he specialized in German politics, American foreign policy and transatlantic relations.
"Protection of brands" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are known brands all over the world.
Armani Polo... what is this really about?
Behind this name is a trademark officially registered in China, but has nothing to do with the original company.
The trade mark thus enjoys protection such that the company that bears the name cannot file a complaint.
And even if she could, he's not sure she'd get a cause.
"It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," explains Thomas Pattloch, lawyer at Taylor Wessing's firm specializing in violation of the property rights in the Far East.
Every week, a new file arrives on my desk.
Imitators need only a few additional letters in order to record their marks.
So instead of Gucci, we record Lu-Gucci, and instead of Prada, we record Prada-Kny.
German companies have also been legally copied, such as Puma, the manufacturer of sports items.
Pattloch opens a binder where registrations are made with the Beijing Trademarks Office.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company filed the brand Zegna DF Puma, a name that the company artificially created by appropriate part of the name Ermenegildo Zegna, the fashion house.
It is a known fact that the Chinese have become champions of the world of copying and violation of intellectual property.
In large cities, there are commercial centres on several floors that sell practically counterfeits.
However, Pattloch's cases are different: his commanders charge him to tackle the fact that the Chinese trade mark office officially confers on Chinese companies the right to use a name that is already protected in another country.
The Chinese speak of "Bang Mingpai", as a relative brand.
The term is derived from "Bang Dakuan".
It is with this term that women who marry rich men are designated.
The Chinese authorities say they have nothing to blame.
"It's bad for business, we have to fight this trend," Pattloch says.
"The brand is sweetened, the singularity disappears, the damage to the reputation is enormous."
Financial losses and costs of justice are estimated at millions for the sectors concerned, especially in the case of expensive light products.
According to data from the CLSA market analysis company, China represents, with an annual volume of EUR 15 billion, the third world luxury market and the fastest growing market.
However, it is not easy to remove questionable registrations from the trademark register and these procedures are costly.
The latter may last up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain.
Pattloch refers to the trials in which the court rejected the complaint, because after a long period of time, the critical name had become a "reality of the market".
Pattloch explains that if the complainant does not have a chance, he may even be forced to pay money to the plagiarism, because he would have damaged his brand in China.
In this area, sometimes it is the law of the jungle that dominates.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler had lost a legal battle against the construction machine manufacturer Sany, the same company that had just bought the concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
That's why Chinese can use an emblem that looks like the Mercedes star.
Geely, Volvo's buyer, used before a blue and white logo that reminded BMW's. The conflict was resolved and Geely had to change it.
The Lacoste fashion house had lost against the beaches of Hong Kong and Singapore which had redirected the gaze of the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
According to the Chinese authorities, they are not guilty of anything.
The CTMO brand office in Beijing admits, however, to having experienced some difficulties in 2010 due to a lack of staff and space.
However, the Office would have passed last year from an "emergency situation in the course of work to a normality found".
Thus, the number of untreated opposition procedures would have decreased by 22%.
Almost 57,000 such cases were reportedly closed, representing an increase of 75% compared to the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 proceedings remain pending at the Office.
Take Expensive Action
As often in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for trademark filing, almost one third more than in 2010.
According to the Office, it is a record and that means that China is at the top of the ranking for the number of new deposits in the world for the tenth consecutive time.
This would also apply to the total number of legal marks, which is 5.5 million.
In 2011, the Office reportedly accounted for 1.8 billion yuan right of registration.
In other words, each record reported an average of 1,280 yuan, or 160 euros.
A legal battle costs much more, as illustrated by the case of the German family business Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the company has been fighting against a Chinese plagiarism.
Of course, the Germans have been able to obtain that the illegal manufacture of vehicle components is suspended.
However, the Imitator was able to maintain his Chinese rights on the Freudenberg brand.
"It's our fault, because family names cannot be protected in Germany," explains Hanno Wentzler, president of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The Trademark Office had therefore rejected the Munich objection.
Freudenberg has certainly gained cause gain from the following two instances, but the opposing side continues to fight until today.
Vigilance is necessary.
Today, the case is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident, he believes in a positive outcome of the trial and boasts the professionalism of judges.
Nevertheless, he adds: "The procedure is long, challenging and costs us a lot of time and money."
It is also difficult to assess internal costs. The archive service has even had to review the actions of the past 100 years in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg had even proposed in vain to the opposing party a "big sum in six-digit euros" to settle the dispute.
"That's what we see what it means for us," Wentzler says.
The dangers of the Far East even threaten to overwhelm Europe.
This would be the case if copyists in this region ensured the operation of unprotected trademarks.
For example, a Chinese producer wanted to name Freudenberg in Germany for a shoe and leather production company.
The company had long abandoned this sector, but it had still been able to prevent the deposit.
Wentzler adds: "vigilance is set."
Pattloch and advise the German companies to exercise great caution in their trade relations with China.
It is not enough, they believe, to rely on international trademark law, that foreigners should rather "register also in China everything that is likely to be protected", as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, costs may be much more important than those of registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg lost the battle in the last act of his legal drama, the company should pay licence fees to the opposing party for the use of its own name, as Wentzler explains.
Or we would lose our place on the market segment in question.
World AIDS Day: foot tapping, singing, helping
The Imbongi Choral repeats at Heidelberg, and the AIDS orphans of Swaziland rejoice at their arrival.
Here's the story of a link that goes far beyond a distance of 8,733 kilometres.
First, we hit the foot: cowboy boots, basketball, scarps for ladies and moccasins for men seek rhythm by hitting the ground of the foot. Very quickly, they find it.
One, two, three, four.
Then the voices of the singers slowly expand - high, low, tenor and soprano - they take over, enchant and follow.
Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor loses almost his canvas shoes when he directs the orchestra with his gestures of wild flexibility.
We are Monday evening, the Choral Imbongi repeats a new song in the music room of the Heidelberg Institute of Medical Psychology.
Fifty singers and singers from 23 to 69 years of age came, from genetics in human medicine to man at home.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each Chorist has different words, all in a very exotic language: the Zulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and some regions of Swaziland.
Be Helped to Help
UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS Programme, estimates that 34 million people worldwide are affected by the disease.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 people infected.
In addition, more than 40% of the population is HIV positive.
180 AIDS orphans from the village of Estitjeni found sponsors in Germany thanks to the association "Voices for Africa".
70 of them attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros per less, one can become a sponsor.
This amount guarantees the child money for the school, a school uniform and a daily hot meal in the gogo center.
Imbongi means in zulu "counter of stories" or even "songer of praises".
No one can commonly speak the Bantu language in this region, but everyone can sing it.
For nearly 10 years, the choir has been repeating songs in this foreign language that it has brought to Germany to return to its native region: South Africa.
As at 8,733 kilometres by flight of Heidelberg bird, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is Esitjeni, the village that depends on the vocal power of the German choral.
40% of people affected
The village has about 2,000 inhabitants, some living in modest huts of straw or land, and most of them are children.
More than 300 of them are orphans, as HIV has taken their parents.
In Eskitjeni, the lowest rate of HIV infection and the lowest life expectancy in the world can be observed on a smaller scale according to UNICEF.
The population almost never accepts male circumcision, a measure that ensures a proven reduction in the risk of infection by half.
More than 40% of Swaziland's population is carriers of the immunodeficiency virus and it is not uncommon to die in the middle of thirty.
On a group trip to Africa in the spring 2005, choral had been able to discover the village. The Imbongis saw mostly many children on the street who lacked not only parental care, but also simply everything: food, clothing, education.
In a poor country without a school degree, there is absolutely no prospect.
At first, there were only a few people who were personally committed to paying a few euros each year in order to be able to send a child to school and offer him a hot meal per day.
But just a year later, Choral founded "Voices for Africa", an association that has since been working almost professionally for the AIDS orphans of Estitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most common sexually transmitted diseases?
Among the bacterial STIs are syphilis, chlamydiates and bleinnorrhagia (or gonorrhea).
Common STIs are HIV, human papilloma virus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Pubis pux and gale belong to parasitic IST.
Which groups are primarily concerned?
Syphilis and mulnorrhage often appear in men who have sexual relations with other men.
The Robert-Koch Institute estimates that sexual contact between men is the origin of at least four cases of syphilis out of five reported in Germany.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia-related infections, trichomonase, candidosis (fungal), bleinnorrhagia and human papilloma virus are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The rate of HIV spread among heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany. However, about 20% of new HIV infections are observed in this group.
In young people, there is a significantly higher rate of chlamydia-related infections than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections concern young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In addition, in Germany, the human papilloma virus is common among young people.
What is the evolution of the number of infections?
It is not mandatory to report all sexually transmitted diseases.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of cases of syphilis more than doubled in 10 years: the figure rose from 1,967 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections has decreased.
In 2011, there were approximately 2,700 cases.
This represents a reduction of one tenth compared to the previous year.
What are the symptoms of a sexual illness?
Infectious diseases can cause abscesses in genital organs, urinary pain, white losses, underflow pain, as well as the appearance of buttons and warts.
However, they do not cause any pain or other symptoms on a regular basis and therefore remain hidden.
How to protect yourself?
Preservatives may reduce the risk of infection, but do not protect 100%.
The reason is that pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases may also be transmitted through lubricating infection or close body contact.
Experts therefore recommend that any person who often changes sexual partners regularly pass examinations.
Most ISTs quickly detected can be cured and late sequelae can be avoided.
Thanks to sponsorships, donations, but above all to funds collected by choristes through their voices throughout Germany, the means are accumulated.
"In all, we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a woman who is sure of herself and who always gets what she wants, manages the money from Germany.
She also ensures that orphans are properly accommodated, for example, in one of their grandmothers.
Gogos, this is what we call the old women in Zulu, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them host up to 14 orphans, offer them a roof and make sure they go to school every day in their uniforms.
The orphan who no longer has anyone is welcomed to a safe place at Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, as are the two cooks who prepare daily meals for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" created a sewing school and allowed the construction of two chickens. With the assistance of the American organization for health PSI, the association organized a HIV testing test for many inhabitants.
This is not true of itself, because even though the disease is well visible throughout the country, it remains a taboo subject.
A king and his 14 wives
"AIDS is a real taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it's a topic that affects sexuality."
It's rather curious, coming from a country whose king has 14 official wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
These measures, which have been sanctioned by the State, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV in recent decades.
Migrant workers have also spread the virus across the country.
However, condoms are found at each corner of the street, adds Annette Lennartz, "but almost nobody uses them.
Culture is different, flesh against flesh."
In order to promote some cultural exchange, Imbongi chorists travel together every two or three years in South Africa and sing songs filled with nostalgia, courage, confidence and black identity that many inhabitants of the tip of the black continent still know about apartheid.
The bus full of whites singing in African language is a sign of recognition as it generates not only good mood and joy, but sometimes also tears out a tear to a few difficult border guards.
The bus always takes them to Eskitjeni, where the choirists visit their boys.
Although it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esitjeni is well known in the Ezulweni Valley.
"Go to Eskitjeni, you'll find some light," people say there.
And after a journey of 8,733 kilometres by bird flight, back to Heidelberg, before these choristers who hit the foot in the rehearsal room of the Bergheimer Straße, there is also light.
Messenger: NASA discovers the presence of ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe reported evidence of the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice layer could reach 20 meters thick.
The American Space Agency NASA has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although this planet is the closest to the Sun, it contains frozen water, as explained by three studies published on Thursday in the specialized journal "Science".
The Messenger probe reported evidence of an ice cover in the region of the planet permanently plunged into the shadow.
This cover would have a thickness of at least 30 centimeters up to 20 meters.
Water probably comes from comets or maybe asteroids that would have hit Mercury.
However, no one connects the discovery of water with the assumption of a presence of life on the planet, explains the chief scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
The discovery could help to understand how water and other essential elements of life have arrived in other regions of the solar system.
Not seen by the inhabitants of our planet, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to the earth, such as small interstices through which we observe the infinite.
The image comes from a photographic apparatus developed by German researchers at the Max-Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the Nain Planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not considered a "planet" according to the new definition of the term of the International Astronomical Union of 2006.
This detail of an infrared photograph taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are blue and the pink dots, more difficult to identify, are the "newborn" in the universe's delivery room.
The Spitzer telescope discovered this region where the stars are born, named "W5", a hardly romantic name, in the constellation of Cassipée, at 6,500 light-years.
NASA's Spitzer telescope photographed the flash of a dying star.
The ring in the shape of a beignet is composed of elements that the star projects when it dies.
In the immense Trifid nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, gas and dust form new stars.
The Spitzer telescope photographed this galactic delivery room.
The Pleiades, a host of stars also called "the seven sisters", can be observed naked during the night.
However, the telescope further enhances the colors.
In this infrared photo, Helix's nebula, like a red eye, looks directly at the viewer.
It is 700 light-years in the Constellation of the Verseau.
His similarities with an Earth continent earned him the title of North America.
The combination of normal photo and infrared photo allows you to observe a spectacular hue.
Only infrared detectors from the Spitzer telescope were able to capture an image of the new star in all its beauty.
One of the greatest puzzles of astronomy is the creation of Saturn's rings.
One theory is that rings are the remains of a moon of Saturn that disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without leaving traces.
One of the largest and nettest photographs taken by the Hubble telescope is that of the Tourbillon galaxy.
According to the dye, photographs of spiral galaxies can become true works of art.
The photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the nebula of the Trifide in the constellation of the Sagittarius, several thousand light years.
Trifide's name comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided, divided into three), because three dust trails divide the bright heart of the place of birth of the stars.
Astronomers photographed the beginnings of a cosmic carabolage in the constellation of the Serpentaire: 400 million light-years from the Earth, the cores of two fusion galaxies rush each other, the collision is inevitable.
The Hubble telescope observed the birth of these stars in the M83 spiral galaxy.
If you don't like technical abbreviations, you can use its nickname "Australian Fire Wheel".
The photo of the Hubble space telescope shows a detail of the Iris nebula, in the constellation of Cephea.
The nebula is 1,400 light-years and consists of dust grains that are ten to a hundred times smaller than the current domestic dust.
This photo has been drawn from optical and radiographic clicks taken by different telescopes.
We can see here the circle composed of black holes that are 430 million light-years from Earth.
The space telescope photographed for NASA this group of galaxies named Arp 273.
Scientists have named the largest spiral galaxy "GC 1810".
In this nebula lies the brightest group of young stars in our milking pathway.
The heavenly cradle always gives birth to new stars.
These star clouds, which are connected by the Rosette nebula, also constantly create young stars at 5,000 light-years from the Earth.
In this galaxy with light rays and pierced with a small black hole, there is no dust yet, there is only gas.
Scientists think he was born shortly after the bigbang, when the universe was largely made up of hydrogen.
Our look at the universe: the main telescopes
The telescope would have been invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before Galilee used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have grown steadily and thanks to them, it has been possible to see further and further into the universe.
For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Hale telescope of the Palomar Mountain Observatory near San Diego was the world's largest telescope.
The mirror on this image had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, in the United States, there is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows to observe the universe through two mirrors with each diameter of 8.4 meters.
The belly of the Gran Telescopio Canarias in La Palma, the Canary Islands, is immense. The mirror alone reaches a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa has been segmented to make savings.
The diameter is approximately eleven metres.
The disadvantage of the method of economic construction is that the telescope is fixed at the vertical angle level, which limits mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also set at the vertical angle level.
Its particularity is due to its great capacity for collecting light.
Despite a relatively small mirror diameter, this capacity is close to those of the world's largest mirror telescopes.
Scientists listen to the universe in search of extraterrestrial signals using Arecibo's radio telescope (Puerto Rico).
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Any person who owns a computer can help the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI, or "search for extra-terrestrial intelligence") by contributing the computing power of his machine.
View on the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope ("very large telescope"), an installation worthy of its name.
Thanks to a total of four mirrors, this telescope can illuminate the average infrared spectrum.
The construction of a very large European telescope (Extremely Large Telescope) is also planned for the ESO website in Chile.
Its main mirror is expected to reach the impressive size of 42 meters. It will consist of nearly 1,000 mirror elements.
However, the telescope will not be able to take clichés before 2018 at the earliest.
Until 2007, Keck's two telescopes on the Hawaiian Mauna Kea volcano were considered the largest in the world.
They had two mirrors of a diameter of 10 meters each.
Keck's telescopes are part of Mauna Kea's observatory that watches the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTF.
A giant new telescope should also be built on Mauna Kea and the diameter of its mirror will reach 30 meters.
This illustration allows us to admire it.
However, the most important images of space come from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, it has given us images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope has been looking for exoplanets, mainly those that are habitable.
NASA announced on February 2, 2011 that it had found 1,235 candidate planets since the start of the mission.
This photo illustrates the latest preparations before the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The James-Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent to space as early as 2018 on board an Ariane 5.
The first mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
In particular, the telescope will have the task of finding light projected by the first stars and galaxies after the bigbang.
Scientists believe that the South Pole of Mercury also houses ice.
However, no reliable data on this theory exists, as Messenger orbits far closer to the North Pole of Mercury.
For decades, radar data indicated the presence of ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the launch of the Messenger probe in 2004, the first orbit around Mercury, scientists are now certain of it.
Drink butter daily, and live up to 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A survey of a country, in which we are still relatively young at 97 years of age.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A survey of a country, in which we are still relatively young at 97 years of age.
The trip to the Talysh mountains is a well-known romance.
In the vicinity of the many rounds of the road, the small bus falls along wooded hills, torrential rivers and modest farms.
Everything is green and fertile, almost believed in the Black Forest.
But here we are in southern Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometres away.
This is where the ethnic group of Caucasian Talysh lives, about which much is unknown, except that they speak perfectly of Persian and Azerbaijani and that they have a very long life.
Terminus: Lerik.
The small plastronne town with its overly aggressive architecture of the Soviet era that does not agree at all with the picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists are rare here, the journey from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is far too difficult.
It takes eight hours to travel the 323 kilometres, because the road has only one path.
The province has not yet benefited from the legendary wealth that the country owes to its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.
However, Pilate Fatulayeva, 48, is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist place.
"Baku became famous in May thanks to the Eurovision competition, and next year there will be the festival of the oldest people in the world," Fatulayeva explains.
She is the director of the longevity museum, the only such museum in the world.
There we can discover the life of about eight tens of Talysh in the region who are over 100 years old. Fatulayeva shows us a picture in black and white.
Here's my grandfather, he's 120 years old.
Having another child at 136 years of age
But the controversial star of the museum is Şirali Müslümov, a shepherd who would have been 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And when you think that the oldest person documented was 122 years old, Müslümov's age seems more than doubtful.
"He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973," Fatulayeva said.
The man would have married three times and he would have had 23 children. At the age of 136, he would still have designed a girl.
Would Şirali Müslümov have been mistaken for a few decades by calculating his age?
Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max-Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard him talk about the man at the great age of Central Asia.
"Unfortunately old people also live in certain regions of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "also in Sardinia, there are men who live incredibly old."
However, it is impossible to establish scientific evidence due to the absence of documents, not to mention that there was no civil registry.
Every day, a glass of melted butter
Nevertheless, it is true that people in the Lerik region often reach a age worthy of the Bible patriarchs.
Currently, 20 people are over 100 years old.
What, then, is the reason for the longevity in the South of that country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, the Azeri tourist guide, explains that Talyshs have particular genes.
On the other hand, Fatulayeva, the director of the museum, thinks it is a matter of food.
However, it does not seem plausible, from a nutritional point of view, that the foods rich in calories of the Talyshs, who love meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of which drink daily a glass of melted butter, are good for health.
Or is it the simple way of life that preserves the youth of people? In Cengemiran, a tiny village near the city of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At the age of 97, she is still relatively young for the region.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest wooden house, as it is typical to see throughout the Caucasus region.
It is sitting on the ground next to a shop, whose contents are untiringly beaten.
Eight people live here under a single roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and a daughter, who have been adults for a long time.
Two little kids crawling in the house too.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests served in typical stomach-shaped armoured glasses.
Mirzayeva's white teeth are perfectly aligned, and under his scarf they hide long strands of a dark blonde that his son reveals us with pride.
I've always washed my hair with milk, and that's how I've never lost them and kept their color.
"I never used shampoo," adds Mirzayeva.
Monthly retirement is enough to live
She always ate what came from her own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and small peas.
All my life, I've never bought any food in a supermarket.
Then she tells us about her husband who was in the army.
The worst moments were after World War II.
But everything improved when the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took orders.
The language of propaganda is surprising in the mouth of an old lady.
However, the worship of the paternal figure of the nation, a man who led his country as a dictator, hardly knew any limits in Azerbaijan
He was in power until 2003, his son Ilham succeeded him later.
In any case, the elderly in Azerbaijan are not aware of the distress.
Mirzayeva receives every month 230 manats (about the same amount as in euros) for her retirement, a sum that guarantees a good life train in the region.
And perhaps the long-term grisoning son of Mirzayeva is right: "the elders enjoy great respect in our culture."
They are the center of the big family, they are loved, cared for and happy.
That's a good reason to live as long as possible.
The "rights of man" omitted in the Constitution
The revolution is reborn in Cairo.
Rival demonstrations reveal the country's deep fracture.
The draft constitution based on sharia is violently controversial.
The Egyptian President is not in favour of words filled with emotion.
We must succeed in the transition.
"And this success is my responsibility to the people and to God," he said on state television.
His speech was intended for the whole people, but also for the Christian Coptics, Liberals, enlightened Muslims and lay people.
For all the members of the confused and desperately disunited opposition are afraid.
They are afraid of a theocracy on the Nile by the powerful Muslim brothers.
Mohamed Morsi stated, almost by apologizing, that he temporarily restricted the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded his "in order to save the revolution".
However, the Egyptians and the world do not really know what this 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate at the U.S. University of Southern California, wants to save.
Will the judiciary be overthrown?
The 234 articles written at haste by the majority Islamic constituent assembly of 100 people during a fifteen-hour night force tour are indeed worrying to some extent.
As in previous constitutions, the draft provides that jurisprudence is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what does the word "princes" really mean?
This was and still remains a question of interpretation, and there is good reason to fear that Islamists will use the vague formulation and the resulting margin of legal manoeuvre to apply a stricter interpretation of the sharia.
In any case, it suggests a newly introduced article stipulating that, with regard to all the subjects relating to the sharia, al-Azhar University must be consulted. The institution is the most important Islamic institution in the country and its spread spreads across the Sunni Islamic world.
This may be possible, but it does not necessarily mean that the clergy will monitor the legislative system, which would in fact lead to the guardianship of the judiciary.
Many points of the draft Constitution are for interpretation
Another problematic aspect is the probable maintenance of military jurisdiction.
During the reign of Mubarak, these courts sought to suppress the opponents.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were detained by the military.
The State must also, in the project, protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "promote its morals and values".
From a legal point of view, the wording is so vague that State institutions could even control the content of cinematography and literature.
Clearly, it would simply be censorship.
Furthermore, no articles specifically guarantee equality between men and women.
Instead, another article prohibits offending or spreading the prophet Muhammad or his envoys.
However, the article does not define what an offence is or how it should be punished.
Also doubtful is the wording suggesting that it is forbidden to "offensive people".
Is it enough to draw a caricature of the president or tell a joke to the detriment of a man of law?
Many points are therefore subject to interpretation in the draft that Morsi is voting on and which, according to his own words, will be "very soon" the subject of a referendum with the Egyptians.
"The revolution was turning away"
The opposition has been mobilizing for weeks against the digital superiority of Islamists.
On Friday evening, tens of thousands of protesters gathered in an unusual accord on Tahrir Square in Cairo, promising to bring down the sharia before it enters into force.
"The revolution is coming back and we are going to win," launches Hamdin Sabbahi, third in the presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace Prize and former leader of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El Baradei stated that the draft Constitution is "to be thrown into the trash of history".
On Twitter, the instant messaging service, he accused Morsi's supporters of wanting to promote a "putsch against democracy".
"If he proclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and we will overthrow him," exclaimed Jasser Said, an opponent.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet at issue," said Egyptian media Khaled Ali, a political man and member of the opposition.
In addition, several judges announced that they did not want to monitor the referendum, which would result in its nullity.
"The Qur'an is our Constitution"
On the other hand, the well-organized Muslim confrererie called for a counter-demonstration not on Tahrir Square as a precautionary measure, but on the other bank of the Nile, where a great prayer was organized before the University of Cairo.
The veiled women and supporters of the Salafists, who participated in it in a large number, scandalized: "the people demand the application of the law of God."
"Clean our country!" they asked Morsi, saying that "the Qur'an [was their] Constitution."
A struggle for sovereignty on the symbolic Tharir Square, where everything began, would soon have generated a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Obviously, that's what Morsi's supporters wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Brothers stated that the opponents of the draft Constitution, in the same way as their supporters, had expressed themselves loud and strong.
According to them, it is now time to let the people decide by the leadership polls that the country must take.
The Islamist project will certainly win the majority.
"Human rights are not mentioned once"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry at the constitutional process imposed which should have extended until February and encompassed all the social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) had defended the Muslim brothers while they were in prison or before the courts under Mubarak.
He did so not because he shared their view of the world, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
That's why he was shot, tried, and imprisoned.
"And now, the term is not even pronounced once in the new Constitution," he regrets during his interview with Welt am Sonntag.
The extension of Morsi's powers to the three powers discouraged the lawyer.
These measures are appalling violations of the rules of democracy and will create a new dictatorship in Egypt.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the President de facto withdraws all his powers," says Saeda.
However, democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels neglected, including by the international community, which looks at the battle between the different political ideologies on the edge of the Nile with a mix of curiosity and nervousness.
This could be paid.
A protester on Tharir Square warns: "You are giving birth to a monster that you will no longer be able to control."
Norway's rakfisk: is it the most smelly fish in the world?
The five million people in Norway benefit from one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe, but also in the world.
Could the secret of the country's success be related to the appetite of premises for an extremely smelly fish?
Take advanced cheese.
Place them in the middle of a pile of wet and dirty football clothes.
Wait a week.
And you get the disturbing smell of rakfisk, one of Norway's most cherished dishes.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about 3 hours from Oslo.
It snows, the landscape is spectacular - and this smell, omnipresent, imprints the air.
The rakfisk consists of salt-scented trout and fermented in the water for a period - depending on the smell you want it to exhale - which can last up to a year.
When darkness settles and it is cold, the Norwegians gather in mass to attend a festival that takes place here in Fagernes, dedicated to this incredible culinary specialty.
"You eat raw, then you drink a glass of aquavit," explains Harvard Halvarsen, a full-time local firefighter also called "Rakfisk General", responsible for managing the festival.
Around us, people use small pieces of fish and get a lot of drink.
"Some people prefer aquavit to rakfisk," Havard adds.
Drink kills the smell.
I'm trying a few pieces.
If you can avoid getting it under your nose, it's not bad - it makes you think of a sushi that would have spent long hours on a bus.
The rakfisk dates back to a time when Norway was poor, before the refrigeration was invented, the fish was immersed in air-tight water barrels and then salted in the fall.
Then, during the winter, once well fermented, the fish came out and - no doubt with the senses diminished by alcohol - eaten.
During the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country to find work, mainly migrating to the United States.
Now, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by full employment, high wages and a complete health system.
The Swedish, their old rivals whose country was not so much richer than Norway, cross the border to come to work.
Rakfisk is considered to be something important, a vital, though odorant, element of Norway's past.
This is part of the most expensive dishes.
But everything is expensive - a small beer paint or a sandwich will cost you 10 € each.
Norway does not often talk about it in international news, which is not to his liking.
Here, people are not willing to talk about Anders Breivik, the extremist rightist racist who killed 77 people, including women and children.
When they mention this murder, they speak of "the incident of July 22".
The Norwegians find it difficult to accept that one of them could commit such an act of barbarism in their peaceful country.
Since the early 1970s, Norway owes its wealth to its oil and gas industry, one of the most important in the world.
"But oil is not the only reason for our success," says Anna, our servant, to the blonde hair and to the eyes of a transverse blue, the image of Nordic well-being, with a shelf of rakfisk by hand.
We are - as you say - prudent people.
His English, like that of most people who live here, is perfect.
We are discreet, we do not like to be noticed.
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution - except for a small percentage of money from this industry, it is invested in a special fund for future generations.
When other countries threw money through the windows, during the years that led to the international financial crisis, Norway was able to keep the cords of its stock market tight.
"As long as we can ski in winter and make hiking in summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"Don't forget the rakfisk," she adds in a shaky laugh.
I stand under the snow and line up to buy what to eat - I got my dose of rakfisk.
On the menu, a hamburger composed of momentum, a true discovery, is excellent.
But tonight, the smell of fish is everywhere.
The hotel I stay in is one of many places where rakfisk is used for dinner and where one can vote for the best of them - or perhaps for the most smelling of them.
There is a TV show where the presenter wears a paper knot, surrounded by rakfisk plates.
We would believe in the Eurovision competition.
"What score did you give to the best fish in the Thor-Juergen Mountains?"
"Here are our points, Harvard."
We hear laughter and applause.
A man falls from his chair, perhaps because of the abuse of aquavit.
Or maybe it's because of the fish emissions.
Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto has a difficult start.
While incoming President Enrique Pena Nieto is preparing to take office in Mexico, Will Grant of the BBC, he is interested in the challenges ahead and the expectations of the people, which are numerous.
Road traffic in Mexico is particularly bad at present.
In a city where bottlenecks are legion in normal time, a security dam has been established since Monday, blocking several key road accesses in the capital and causing real chaos on the roads.
However, the aim was not to prevent people from going to work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
Next Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the Presidential scarf to become the new president at the head of the nation.
A complicated task awaits him.
The Mexican economy is doing well, thanks to the outgoing president Felipe Calderon, but the country is suffering from a drug war that has already cost about 60,000 people their lives in six years.
"My government has made a commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," Mr. Pena Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office a little earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before joining the US President, Mr. Pena Nieto was governor of the State of Mexico.
A very populated and tentacular state that encloses the capital. On its land of predilection, opinions about this new leader are divided.
A direct man
In the bucolic municipality of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is inscribed in the memory of all.
The premises give it the development of tourism and infrastructure in the municipality.
To reach the city, you can take one of M Pena Nieto's new highways, a major improvement has been made to these roads, once bosseled and full of cracks.
Plates bearing its name are attached outside a new sports complex and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
"We count on him to put in place lasting changes," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of the congress and party of Mr. Pena Nieto, the PRI.
In terms of security and economics in particular, we hope for a real change that our country needs so much.
After 81 years without fail in power, the PRI was enunciated in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the Presidential Palace of Los Pinos, there are many expectations within the party concerning Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejects the criticisms of the opponents who blame the new president for lack of charism.
He is an entire man, very committed, with an excellent vision of the country.
He's an excellent stateman and, above all, he can listen.
However, it is not always the image that the people of their former governor have.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more flagrant.
Hidden under the motorways, it is, in many respects, a suburb of Mexico City.
And the problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban.
Earlier this year, soldiers were called upon to rescue drug gangs in the neighbourhood, and violence against women was particularly serious.
In a disaster zone, the bodies of dozens of women murdered in the last two years have been found on the edge of the landfill.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Pena Nieto was governor, a much higher rate than in the very violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place sadly famous for the number of innocent women who were killed there.
Mr. Pena Nieto's detractors say that at best, he failed to tackle the problem of killing women when he was in office.
At worst, they accuse their administration of refusing to see the reality in front of them.
In a concrete house, typical of this decomposed neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles to hold back her tears when she shows me pictures of her deceased daughter Mariana Luna.
The official version reported a suicide committed by Mariana in 2010.
However, her family thinks she was killed by her partner.
"When I arrived at her house, it seemed to me that her body had been washed," says Mrs. Buendia.
Signs indicated that she had been beaten, and body stiffness had already begun.
As her mother tells the story, a photo of Mariana dresses the wall, next to a cross where the word "Justice" appears.
However, that is exactly what the family was denied.
The authorities treated me as if I were an old nun, a troublemaker, a laurnist.
They want us to accept what they say and shut up.
"But it is not normal that there are so many irregularities and omissions," she said.
When President Pena Nieto receives his scarf on Saturday, he will bear a heavy responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised that he will make it his priority during his term of office.
"I hope that he will be as good as he will be as president when he was governor," said Olvera, in Valle del Bravo, member of Congress.
However, this is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear the most.
Bradley Manning didn't complain about ill-treatment, prosecutors said.
Prosecutors are trying to counter claims of ill-treatment that Bradley Manning allegedly suffered during detention.
The trial concerns Manning's detention in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defence wants to classify the case on the grounds that Manning's kidnapping has taken place under extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is accused of having stolen thousands of confidential documents.
The prosecutors tried to prove, on Friday, that Private Bradley Manning -- accused of causing the biggest leak of confidential information in the entire history of the U.S. Army -- missed many opportunities to complain about the ill-treatment he claimed to have suffered during his military detention.
During a cross-examination with Manning, during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Prosecutor Maj. Ashden Fein stated that records of weekly visits to Manning by officers during his nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia revealed no complaints regarding his treatment.
The cross-examination -- during a hearing, the defence filed a petition demanding that Manning be classified on the grounds that the kidnapping was carried out under very difficult conditions and constituted a sufficiently severe punishment -- occurred one day after Manning testified that he wanted to commit suicide during his detention.
This military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of having stolen thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The documents were then published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed Manning was their source.
At the Friday hearing, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms that officers had completed after their meeting with Manning, during his detention in Quantico military prison, where he was subjected to maximum prison isolation from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein referred to the forms, on Friday, Manning recognized that the treatment he had received from his guards was "excellent" and that his treatment in prison was generally "very professional."
The forms do not report any complaints of ill-treatment, although the officers directly questioned him about his prison treatment, Fein stated.
Manning replied that he had orally expressed concerns about certain problems and that the visiting officers had discussed his concerns and indicated that they would deal with them, but did not address the issues raised.
"They wrote "no problem" (after addressing the concerns), and yet that did not mean that I had not raised any problems," Manning said.
Military Judge Col. Denise Lind also asked Manning why he had not complained about his treatment during an interview in January 2011 with the special commission that had met to discuss the suicidal thoughts he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during the meeting was to change his restrictive status indicating a "injurious risk".
The military stated that they had assigned him this restrictive status -- a level below the close surveillance for suicide risk -- for its protection and safety of others.
"I wanted the staff to know that I was doing well, and I wanted to get rid of this status... in order to enjoy a better quality of life from my point of view," Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison at the Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He stated that he had considered suicide when he was in Kuwait and had fainted once because of the heat.
He added that the fact that he was not aware of what was going to happen to him or of what was going to happen to him in the rest of the world was very worrying.
"My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, this cage," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I was gonna die in that cage.
Once in Quantico, Manning stated that he had spent the clearest of his time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours -- without company.
Manning also added that the only objects he had were a mattress, a blanket, tongs, clothes and glasses.
He tried to stay moving, because sleeping or lying down during the day was contrary to the regulations.
Manning also said that when he tried to sleep, he had a light in his eyes, lit outside his cell.
If the guards did not see his face when he turned around at night, they would wake him up so he could see his face.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint for Manning's treatment in January 2011.
Manning was placed in a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
On Friday too, the judge asked Manning about an allegation reported in his Thursday testimony -- that after being forced to sleep naked all night in his cell in Quantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of the guards and other detainees one morning during the call.
Manning testified that at no time was allowed to cover with cover during the call.
During the judge's questions on Friday, Manning stated that he had deduced from his guard's order that he should release his cover that could have hidden his nudity, but he recognized that no one had ordered him to release it.
Manning testified on Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before, because he would have tried to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning would have told the officer that he could have used the elasticity of his slip or his tongs to hurt himself, but he had not.
That night Manning testified that his underwear, his tongs, and his glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that at least the judge will take into account the experiences he had experienced during his detention and that he will greatly reduce his sentence if he should be found guilty before a court of martial, a trial that should be held early next year.
The defence stated that Manning intends to plead guilty of the least serious crimes and to fight for the abandonment of other charges deemed to be too extreme.
The hearing should resume this weekend, with prosecutors who should argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon confirmed that Manning was incarcerated in accordance with the regulations governing the conditions of detention of all detainees in Quantico.
The charges brought against Manning include the theft of public property or documents, the collusion with the enemy, resulting in the illegal publication of information on the Internet, and the transmission of information relating to national defence.
If all the charges are held, he will be sentenced to life in criminal detention.
My Mexico-American identity crisis
He said that many were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunity
Mexicans tend to blame those who have gone away; they remind Mexicans of difficult times, he said.
Navarrette says that Mexico-Americans are caught between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico, arriving in the lobby, in front of customs and immigration services, I felt lost.
Panels indicated two ways: one for "Mexicans" ("Mexicans"), another for "Extranjeros" ("Externals").
I stayed still for several seconds, not knowing which line to lead me to.
I grew up in central California, where I was called the Mexican all my life.
This is an ethnic qualification, as is the one my friends in Boston use when they call themselves "Irish", or my friends in New York when they call themselves "Italian".
Then I became "Mexico-American".
But here it was Mexico.
And on the earth that my grandfather was born, no need for special qualifications or union traits.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, well enough to manage an interview in one language or another.
But I don't have the vocabulary of an Aboriginal person, and I can't lose my American accent.
So I took my U.S. passport and headed for the "Foreigners" line.
I thought about that time of the week when the new Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama at the White House.
Generally, when the leaders of these two countries meet, their main themes are immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans stayed in Mexico rather than risking themselves in the United States.
He wants to join the United States and Canada, and create a Union for Trade on the European Union model, but in North America.
And Pena Nieto pledges to continue the war on drug cartels in Mexico, although he has not provided any further details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of bitterness.
Most Americans probably never thought about the fact that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to give in writing half of their territory to the tip of the gun.
But for Mexicans, who think in terms of centuries, and not minutes, memories are everywhere.
Therefore, as soon as a U.S. official makes the slightest criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear -- in the Mexican press, and among the elite -- complaints about how Americans are violating the sovereignty of their neighbours.
And the children of Montezuma are looking for a fight.
And yet, for Mexico, the most difficult relationship is that of the country with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
You want us to discuss the subject of bitterness?
There's a lot of them.
Mexico has its winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom the country does not offer them.
The only reason that explains the large number of Mexican ancestors in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at some point, in our genealogical tree, a person, perhaps a parent or grandfather, found no opportunity in Mexico and had to go to the North.
And most often, this person was a typical profile -- a dark, uneducated skin, coming from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even if we are currently living in the American dream, that we went to good schools and have good situations, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream that we live in, not that of Mexicans.
Our identity is sometimes disturbed, but our loyalty is obvious.
We grant it to the United States.
On the other hand, we know that some of the Mexican elite among the ruling class does not like us.
The feeling is reciprocal.
We remind them of a humiliating defeat and they cough us as if we were individuals of inferior strain and not enough Mexican.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
For them, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families had not failed when they lived in Mexico, they would never have left.
And we would not be stuck on the right side of the barrier, living comfortably in the United States, but like lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and who legally emigrated to the United States while she was a child, reminds me that there are frictions between Mexicans and Mexico Americans, because Mexicans are more firmly claiming their identity and Mexico Americans are opposed to it.
Although she is an American citizen, she feels that she is part of two countries.
In addition, many Mexican-Americans I know do not seem to be part of one country or another.
We love the music of the Mexican group, Los Tigers del Norte, but also that of Bruce Springsteen.
We have the best of both worlds, but we are not rooted in either.
In Mexico, we are considered Americans.
And in the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
And now, to complicate the relationship a little more, as I learned during my stay, some Mexican leaders and some of the intelligentsia want to get closer to the Diaspora.
They want Mexico-Americans to work as ambassadors of fortune for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We will have to explain to our American compatriots that Mexico is a superb country that absolutely needs to be visited and put pressure on political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course.
That won't happen.
There's too much bitterness.
And if we consider wage inequality, corruption and drug-related violence that are ubiquitous, many of us are not convinced that this is a fantastic country.
You're gonna have to take care of yourself, guys.
It's normal.
If some Mexicans are not ready to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, they must therefore accept that some Mexican-Americans still want them in the way their family members were treated so long ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more Mexicans than I thought.
Old disputes, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is still a failure for peace.
Can there never be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed seems to indicate that such a hope is futile.
While the same futile arguments persist to know who started, dozens of buildings were reduced to dust; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them were civilians, and six Israelis were killed; and for the first time, rockets from Gaza landed near Tel-Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although the Israelis and Palestinians seem to be stuck in their old conflict, all around them, the Middle East is changing.
The Arab spring has blown everything up, whether it is desired or not, the Palestinians and Israelis are caught up in this regional upheaval.
Perhaps their struggle will intensify a little further.
Yet, there is every reason to think that this could help them get out of this deadly deadlock.
A war that doesn't make any losers or winners
At first glance, it seems difficult to show optimism.
Although the ceasefire on November 21st continues, this week's fighting has strengthened the supporters of the force, both sides.
Hamas leaders, the Islamist movement that has been leading Gaza since 2007, will refrain from forcing the Israelis to give up, even though Gaza has shrunk.
Having killed some of its leaders and rejected the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most miserable and overcrowded parts of the world, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground over the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently at the hands of their Fatah rivals, the other more moderate Palestinian faction.
Furthermore, Hamas leaders could say that time is their ally.
The influence of the Arab world Islamists is increasingly strong, and Hamas has become rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a growing regional power, once Israel's closest Muslim ally, has made and caused for Hamas; like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic states in the Gulf.
Hamas members jubilee and say that the Muslim crescent bends around Israel, from Lebanon, to the north, where the Hezbollah militia exercises its rule, passing through Syria, where Islamist rebels can overthrow Bashar El Assad, and even Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And most importantly, on the southern side of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brothers under the presidency of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, from far the most populated and central Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, this despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until its fall in 2011, had little time to devote to Hamas.
On the other hand, the Muslim Brothers are Hamas cousins, and their leaders are more easily referred to public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas can emerge as an important actor that can no longer be excluded even by Israel and America.
Meanwhile, supporters of Israel's hard line will draw the opposite conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas has been packaged.
The missile interception system named Iron Dome has proven its effectiveness and many Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will be able to sleep on their two ears for a while.
In terms of diplomacy, America renews its unwavering support; and many European countries have accused Hamas of being the source of the last wave of violence.
Above all, however, Israel has prospered, particularly under the Prime Minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, who has completely ignored the peace process.
Although the rocket fire in Gaza had killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel had been spared by suicide attacks, including through the Israeli separation barrier, the main piece of what might be a Palestinian state, and which protected Jewish colonies that continued to expand despite their illegality in international law.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose party Likud merged with an even more belligerent party, that of the leader Avigdor Lieberman near the election on 22 January, has the beautiful part.
Why do you want to pamper these Palestinian fictitiouss by giving them a state?
If they were leading the West Bank, would they not launch rockets, as their compatriots did in Gaza?
It is best to keep them behind this wall and hit them as soon as they come out of their head.
Perhaps the supporters of the hard line will win it; but the Arab spring may change the gift.
Although Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere appreciate little Israel, their priority will be to address problems in their own countries.
The defence budget of Israel is more important than that of its four Arab neighbours.
Starting a war with local superpower will not help new Arab governments to manage their economies.
Mr. Morsi worked with Barack Obama to get a cease-fire which is augur well -- and could mark the beginning of something.
Israelis should also think about the future.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a powder that is destined to explode one day in the territories occupied by Israel - somewhat like the bus that exploded in Tel-Aviv this week.
The repression already weakens democracy in the Jewish state, and demographics exacerbate this problem as the Arab population increases.
The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to play Hamas will have a diplomatic award.
Both sides need to be pushed by those on the outside.
The answer remains the one advocated by the reasonable people on each side, and by the majority of the outside world and by this newspaper: two states, with a transfer of territory by Israel in exchange for security.
A small and short-term hope is that the ceasefire will give outsiders the opportunity to defend this cause.
Egypt, which must now endeavour to put an end to the flow of arms to Gaza, in the same way as Turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in accordance with the 1967 borders with exchanges of land and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs from outside countries should also pressure Hamas and Fatah to join.
This would contribute much more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the forthcoming proposal for a pseudo-state at the United Nations.
Mr. Obama also has every interest in what Israel agrees to negotiate.
During his first term of office, he did not present his own peace plan.
Returning to the White House, he seems equally reluctant to establish one.
It's a very narrow vision.
The stability of the Middle East is a vital issue for America.
This is through a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Laws for neutral cigarette packages came into force in Australia
Warnings and photos of sick organs cover the dark green packages that are all the same, regardless of the brand
This law entered into force in Australia is a world's first, logos and colors have been replaced by a dark green olive and horrible photos of sick organs and representations of children and babies whose diseases have been caused by the smoking of their parents.
Apart from the different photos and health warnings, the only difference between packages, since this Saturday, is the name of the brand, printed in small characters on all packages.
This is the most stringent tobacco packaging regime in the world.
The Australian federal government stated that the goal was to deter young people from smoking by eliminating glamour.
Studies have shown that if people have not started smoking before the age of 26, there is 99% chance that they will never start.
"Even when they are very young, children include the message conveyed by tobacco manufacturers through their brand image," said Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that revealed, for example, that children associated the crown of a logo with a princess."
Although Australia has the lowest smoking rate in the world and these changes have little impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries are considering a similar approach.
The tobacco industry has put pressure on this law.
Tobacco manufacturers said that this would boost the black market trade, which would make it easier to access cheaper cigarettes.
"Bad consequences will arise from this legislation," said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
China and Indonesia will sell much more counterfeit cigarettes in the streets of Australia.
Others stated that this law had energized their activity.
Sandra Ha de Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said that the demand for cigarette cases, including silicone to mask the horrible packaging, has increased sharply two months ago since British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco challenged the law and lost in front of Australia's high court.
He said Zico sold 6,000 to wholesalers and is waiting for stock renewal.
For us, business is good.
The only problem, experts say, is the popularity of social media and the population group targeted by the plan.
After a series of Australian laws prohibiting TV advertising, sports sponsorship and the obligation for retailers to hide cigarettes, tobacco marketing is now available online.
Australia has banned advertising on the web by businesses and local sites, but it cannot prevent foreign sites from doing so.
"If you are working in tobacco marketing and you have only a small window to promote your products, the Internet is the perfect place," said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noted an increase in the contributions of some Lambda citizens to brands on social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
We have to ask ourselves whether this is a mere citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes and who has been able to make a video, or whether it is a marketing campaign orchestrated by an agency?
British American Tobacco Australia stated that the industry focuses on the new regulations in force rather than on marketing.
The industry went to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge these new justice decisions - these countries told WHO that trade was unfairly disadvantaged, although none of these countries had significant trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected to be taken in the course of 2013.
Libersek stated that the government had held discussions with other countries about similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to make packaging warning photos mandatory in 2001.
These warnings are now present in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More stringent laws are currently being studied in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these photos.
The pictures don't bother me.
I don't know them.
"You take a cigarette and you store the package," said Victor El Hage when buying a package on which a photo of tumor of the mouth appears.
To be honest, the only reason I'm gonna be arrested is my little girl.
James Yu, manager of the "King of the Pack Tobaccoist" in central Sydney, said that the uniformity of the packages made storing packages on the shelves difficult.
"Before I needed an hour to unload a package, now I need four hours," Yu said.
"The government had only to ban them once for all and we would have said OK, okay, we stop and put the key under the door," he added, raising our arms to the sky.
In a constantly connected world, it may be good to get bored.
I spent five hours at an airport during the Thanksgiving period, because our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
Therefore, I have had enough time to reflect on the theme of boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spending half a day at an airport to wait for a flight is quite boring, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to distract you (not forgetting the duty-free shops).
But more and more, some academics and experts in child development praise boredom.
It is perfectly normal for us - and our children - to get bored from time to time, they say.
This forces the brain to borrow interesting ways, or even to feed creativity.
And since we are, for the most part, constantly facing several types of screens, we no longer know the benefits of boredom.
So should we welcome the boredom with open arms?
Yes.
And no.
But I'll be right back.
First of all, like many people, I thought that boredom was a rather recent phenomenon, particularly since we had more free time.
But this is not the case, says Peter Toohey, professor of Greek-Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011).
"The boredom goes very far," he says.
On the walls of Pompeii are Latin graffiti that evoke the boredom, they go back to the first century.
Then there is the definition that we give to boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined and discussed in various ways, said John D. Eastwood, Associate Professor of Psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After going through many publications and submitting the idea to a discussion group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience that consists of "wanting to do something, but not getting into a satisfactory activity."
What distinguishes the boredom of apathy, he says, is that the person is not undertaking a task even if she would like it.
With apathy, he says, there's no desire to do anything.
What is at the heart of the boredom, he said, is "the interruption of the attention process, associated with a bad mood and the feeling that time passes slowly."
The boredom can be very similar to depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that if both can be connected, people who get bored tend to think that the problem comes from the environment or the world, while depressed people think that the problem comes from them.
Sometimes we sometimes think that we get bored when it's actually a concentration problem.
As part of their study, "The Uncommitted Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", which was published in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science" in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues highlighted an earlier experience in which participants listened to a cassette, the voice of a person reading a magazine article.
Some groups heard, from the next room, the sound too loud of a TV show that had no reports, others just heard the TV show, and the third group did not hear the soundtrack at all.
Those who heard the TV at a low sound level said they were more bored than the other two groups - they had a hard time concentrating, but they didn't know why, and attributed this problem of concentration to boredom.
When you try to focus on a difficult or challenging task, an interruption of attention can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, an aggregate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you do a boring task, "like looking at objects on a assembly chain, music can help you not to get bored."
In fact, he says, now we know that when people get torturing themselves or gryphoning, these gestures, often regarded as signs of boredom, are in fact a good way to stay physically more alert.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to gigote learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to remain motionless," said Professor Fenske.
We all get bored one day or the other - the delay of my plane flight, a speaker with a monocord voice, a particularly boring movie.
But some people are more likely to get bored than others.
To measure this, researchers developed a "Predisposition to boredom" in the 1980s.
The scale includes statements like, "Of the tasks I do, many of them are repetitive and monotonous," and "I have so many centers of interest that I don't have time to do everything."
Using such a scale, researchers discovered that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, and in particular need numerous and varied stimulations.
In general, however, adolescents are soon blasphemed.
In 1991, Reed Larson, an individual and community development professor at the University of Illinois, conducted an experience in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day via a beeper.
He noted that 32 percent of adolescents reported being bored at school and during homework at home, while 23 percent reported being bored when they were not at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson stated that he did not know whether the percentages of today's boredom, or 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he added that he knew that "adolescence is a period when boredom reaches its highest level," especially because children and adolescents do not have much control over what they want to do.
If I rest my question: is boredom good for you?
Sometimes not, because in its extreme form, it can lead people to take absurd physical risks, bet or abuse certain substances to spend time, as studies show.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers speak of a link between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying the problem for more than two decades.
"The boredom is the way the brain has found to let you know that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the U.S.
But the brain does not always know what the most appropriate thing to do.
If you get bored and use this energy to play guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will make you happy in the short term, but not in the long term.
So if your child gets bored and you give him an iPad, he won't get bored anymore, but he won't learn to take care of himself or self-control," says Professor Fenske.
And "this self-regulation goes from one situation to another," he says.
Your child not only learns to have fun, he gets more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should glorify the boredom.
Just as I don't think we should criticize him.
Feel comfortable outside the constant boiling that generate activities and technology is the goal to which we should tend.
Professor Eastwood agrees on this.
"We need to get bored more often, but boredom awakens an acute and frenetic desire to be connected to something that makes sense," he said.
According to him, what people are looking for is a way to disconnect and appreciate the stopping times.
"In an environment where we are constantly hyperstimulated," he added, "it is difficult to find ways to get into something when the noise stops."
In Colorado, no directive for the new marijuana law
Anthony Orozco, 19, a university student and a footballer in Colorado, is charged with something that will soon become legal in his condition: possession of marijuana balls and a pipe used to smoke them.
Mr. Orozco said that one day, in September, he and some friends were on board a car in Lamar, in the middle of the fields, near the border with Kansas, when they were arrested.
After the police officer found the marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a quote to appear for possession of drugs and equipment that could serve his consumption - minor offences, each accompanied by a $100 fine - and a date of appearance.
"We are treated as criminals," said Mr. Orozco.
But is there one?
During the weeks of uncertainty that followed Colorado's vote to legalize the consumption of small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the response to hundreds of cases involving low drug use depends more on the place than on the law.
Here and in the state of Washington, which has adopted a similar measure, hundreds of crimes involving marijuana use have been classified without delay.
Police have stopped charging adults over 21 years of age for the possession of marijuana, as the law will enter into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in Colorado's more conservative districts have called for accelerating existing marijuana cases and continue to incriminating people who own them.
At the same time, several cities from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains are currently voting to prevent the opening of state-approved marijuana sales shops in their neighbourhoods.
"Things are changing so quickly that I don't know what the future holds," said Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, east of Denver.
Washington State regulators also have a good deal of questions.
They are looking for guidelines on how to install a permit system, allowing them to produce, manufacture, distribute and sell - before the deadline of December 1, 2013.
They say that Colorado, whether desired or not, is ahead of most states of marijuana regulation, first of all with regard to therapeutic use and now with regard to personal use.
"The Colorado has a more regulated market, and is a good indicator," said Brian E. Smith, spokesperson for the Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But no place or system, acknowledges Mr Smith, can do more than suggest what works.
"There is no real precedent on which we could base ourselves," he said.
The Washington Act, called I-502, takes effect on December 6, leaving a one-year legal vacuum, during which the permit system still does not exist, while the possession of marijuana will be legal.
In the meantime, practical questions remain pending: how to balance the mandate of the state that guarantees adequate access to approved marijuana and prohibits the installation of cannabis sales shops within a radius of 30 km around a school, park, playground or day care centre.
"There will be no more difficult places than urban areas to install a licensed cannabis trade, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area," said Ben Livingston, a spokesperson at the Centre for Cannabis Legalization, a newly formed research group.
On 21 November, the police chief, Oates, in Aurora, sent an e-mail to his officers, announcing that the "City aroundney" (a public prosecutor's representative) would no longer pursue people aged 21 and over who have small amounts of marijuana, and that the police should stop blaming people for this type of crime "in the immediate sense."
Chief Oates stated that the police would implement the new judicial decisions that regulate the activity of those who grow marijuana for medical purposes, and that it would continue to pursue drug traffickers and dealers.
In Weld County, northern Colorado, the "district aroundney" (Procurator of the Republic), Ken Buck, has a more stringent vision.
After the vote, he stated that his office would continue to deal with marijuana possession cases, mainly in order to pressure users to detoxify themselves.
At present, 119 persons are charged with possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many of them are the subject of further charges.
"Our office has an obligation to prosecute these persons who committed a crime that, at the time of the facts, was a recognized offence," said Buck.
The reactions were even complicated in rural areas such as Mesa County, where voters rejected the initiative for the limited consumption of marijuana.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer appear as adults for the possession of limited quantities.
The representative of the county's public ministry, Pete Hautzinger, supported this decision, but also decided not to immediately classify all marijuana detention cases.
"I don't feel like I'm wasting my time applying the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, providing a legal and governmental framework suitable for the personal consumption of marijuana is not easy.
And the contradictory reactions that have been observed in different American cities highlight the deep ambivalence among local officials regarding the legalization of marijuana.
"This is a cultural barrier" with public prosecutors' representatives, said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents people accused of marijuana consumption and who expresses himself as the local spokesperson for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
"Did they spend much of their lives pursuing in court those who consumed marijuana, too, have difficulty accepting it to be legal," he said.
As the first states to treat the low consumption of marijuana at the same level as that of alcohol, Colorado and the state of Washington are becoming a case of case law for drug legalization.
While state defenders and representatives are planning a new legalized sales border, they look forward to the federal government's directives, which always refer to the sale and culture of marijuana as federal crimes.
Defenders of the legalization of marijuana hope that the Ministry of Justice will give in.
Despite some mediated arrests of patients under therapeutic marijuana and vendors, the federal government has mainly allowed marijuana sales for therapeutic purposes to be conducted in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
While it is true that the police are probably not going to go through the doors to seize small drug bags, there is strong reason to bet that they oppose the licensed sales of marijuana for personal use authorized by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former political adviser to the Obama administration.
Many cities in Colorado did not expect federal authorities to act.
Long before the votes, some local governments have approved moratoriums on the creation of new marijuana sales, even if it is only a one-year postponement.
Last week, the city of Montrose obtained a six-month moratorium, and should impose this ban next week.
"We do not want to find ourselves in a situation where a permit is granted to someone and then face a federal problem," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the municipal council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are interested in the vote of the community rather than the vote of the state.
A lot of questions arise.
Petronella Wyatt: I was mistreated and excluded from Oxford because I was a "Tory" (conservative).
It is not only today's students who are attacked for their opinions.
As far as I remember, I've always dreamed of entering Oxford University.
My father and older brother studied in what was for me a great place to know, a kind of Greek amphitheater of modern times that stimulates the two pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
Yet, two weeks after I moved to Worcester College in the late 1980s to study history, I decided to pack my bags, causing the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and started to cry.
My friends were upset.
The newspaper of L'Evening Standard claimed that I had left this university because I objected to the fact that first-class students had sexual relations in the room next to mine.
Author A. N. Wilson Faetically declared that I was leaving after being forced to drink in broken cups.
The truth was less funny.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran away, because I had been the victim of intimidation and was constantly being bullied.
Not because of my name rather offensive, nor because I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one and only reason, and in this cradle of the so-called knowledge, I was the victim of racist and barbaric behavior: my sorry father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influential adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why bring this up today, you'll tell me.
Well, recent studies have shown that a new generation of middle-right students suffer the same type of persecution.
The growing and institutionalized hatred of Tory students in Oxford is such that last week, some of them demanded protection of their rights, as did those of gays, disabled persons and ethnic minorities.
The conservative members of the student room (JCR) of Corpus Christi College stated that they were "often isolated, personally attacked and felt undesirable" because of their political views.
They want a representative on the University Committee for Equal Opportunities so that their opinions can be expressed freely.
Their situation was not facilitated by the recent documentary broadcast on BBC Two "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" ("The Wonderland: Young, Intelligent and Right"), dedicated to student politics, and depicting the "Tories" as eccentric and neo-Nazi.
In particular, there was student Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), who moved to Rolls-Royce, a fully silvered tree tree and moved with a chromed-headed cane.
At other universities, conservative students claim to be treated as emissary cows for the establishment of an increase in school fees."
Luke Black, 20 years old, vice president of the Nottingham University Conservative Association, told a Sunday newspaper "that there is a growing left-wing party in universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even meeting us."
Samuel Roberts, aged 21, a student in history at Corpus Christi, who proposed a motion for further protection, says that such a climate is "uncomfortable", and Stephanie Cherill, 19 years old, president of OUCA, says that there has been a deterioration in the attitude of JCR members towards people who are centre-right.
"This is an obstacle to the freedom of intellectual debates, as well as the well-being of members," she said.
I was the only one thinking like that in my first few weeks at Oxford.
I entered September 1986, then 18 years old and a paralysing shyness.
The hate of the conservative party was very virulent.
The previous year, the university had voted against the refusal to grant Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary title, because of the reduction in the funding of higher education.
The atmosphere was charged with Stalinian vibrations.
From the first days of the week of reception, when the new students met with others and teachers, I had a taste of what was going to happen later.
I discovered that teachers not only participated in the sarcasms against Tory students but also took pleasure in them.
It was as if the policy on strike minors, the privatization and opposition of the government to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa were engraved on the wood of the classrooms.
The first sarcasm I was the victim of involved a translation into English of the 18th century French texts, and I was not prepared there.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "be careful to translate the first paragraph"
I lost my foot.
Pitt, a little man with a stinky face, took easy.
"Do Thatcherists refuse to learn French or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students laughed.
The tears burned my eyes.
"I suggest you take French lessons during your spare time - finally, if you're not too busy to make friends," he launched a hard tone.
I went back to my room, inconsolable.
At dinner tonight, I sat alone and then felt a slight tap on my shoulder.
He was a second year student of English studies, named James, who presented himself as a member of OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said, gently.
I'm afraid so.
Any person suspected of being a Tory (conservative) is targeted.
It's already hard enough for me, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be even harder for you.
Most Tory youth claim to be Labourers.
Later, at the local pub, I let go of trying to hide.
I insisted that I disagreed with everything Mrs Thatcher said.
This stratagem failed.
A first year student of philosophy, political and economic sciences who, ironically, had studied in Eton, said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're contaminated.
Other students resumed the draft.
I was perverted, man.
"How do the Tories make love?" asked one of them.
They're hitting each other, aren't they?"
I felt like homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Would I have only been able to lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I have been forced to meet people who share the same views only after the fall of the night?
Should I have become a Labourer and deny my views?
The next three years would look like a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only open professor Tory was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history, who taught in my university.
He was hated not only because he was a conservative, but also because he was an external political adviser to Thatcher and one of the authors of his speeches.
He was almost never there.
He hated this provincial and insignificant place, as well as its adherence to the Marxist-Determinist viewpoint of history.
In 1997, he accepted a position as a professor at the University of Bilkent, Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he said.
I started doing a shuttle between Oxford and my parents' house in London, finding refuge with my family and my more open-minded city friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and explained why.
He was unbelievable.
During his studies in Oxford in the 1940s, all political points of view were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said pathetically.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city with dreamy bells.
Even my Communist friends had irreprehensible ways.
He had tears in his eyes.
Leave them a chance.
I'm sure it's to tease you.
It would break my heart if you left Oxford.
Tired by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance has gradually deteriorated.
A friend, also Tory, succumbed to pressure and gave up his convictions.
During a work session conducted the following week, when another history teacher suggested the most seriously in the world, that I was "an enemy of the people", I decided to do so.
I admitted to being a victim of my parents' brainwashing and treated them as "crazy old."
The repetition was short-lived.
It's my father who broke the last nail of my Oxford coffin.
At that time, he wrote two columns in the Murdoch press every week.
My door was locked.
I stayed carpeted in my room, and after five minutes, my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never went back.
You can treat me as a wet pleurinchard chicken.
But no 18-year-old child should be subjected to such intimidation in a school institution.
The most tragic thing is that it was Oxford, which not only produced 14 Prime Ministers Tory, but also enjoys an incredible reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to fame"
As part of the exhibition "Valentino: a Master of Couture", inaugurated this week in London, ABC interviewed Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian Couturier.
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth Ire of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The seamstress recognized him at the inauguration of "Valentino: a Master of the Couture", a prestigious retrospective that brings together more than 130 high seam models created for his sewing house over the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he said with his inimitable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the organ point of a story whose only protagonist is "the lady" Garavani, but who could not have been written without his famous clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and other than the nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until 3 March next, we find an impressive number of private letters and photos signed by the cream of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, passing through Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino presents his personal memories as the trophies of his social ascension: from the modest seam of the city of Voghera, north of Italy, to the idol of the international jet-set.
There's nothing wrong with loving royalty.
"At least they don't crack their cigarette chins on your beautiful carpet like some pop music stars do," says Barone Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and receives with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved to be invited to his Gstaad cottage," explains former woman "Heini" Thyssen, a close friend of past beauty such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to fame.
And even so, he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino model
The Argentine model, Valeria Mazza, also didn't forget the costumer's charisma.
Several years ago, after a parade on the Spanish Square in Rome, we went to his apartment for dinner.
We were about twenty people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
We saw and felt his mind in every detail of his apartment, in decoration, food, music.
"With him, each guest felt important and appreciated," recalls the "top model", which began working with him during the week of the Haute-Couture in Paris in 1995.
"It will never go through fashion, because its creations are works of art," she said.
Noblesse Line Scroll
Garavani's life is not a story of obsessions but shared love.
He loves the high people and with the greatest titles and they also love him.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a 60-foot wide glamorous podium that proposes to exchange roles: the visitor takes the seat of the mannequins and has to parade on the podium to admire a "public" dream with the main creations of Valentino, such as the tailor Jackie Kennedy had chosen for her wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the costume Monica Vitti wore in "La Notte", or a wool and fur coat belonging to the Empress Farah Diba.
This mannequin audience includes names such as Sybille de Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit de Norway, Rosario de Bulgaria or Sophie de Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the Couturier in 2006
Many of her clients say that Valentino's first clothes are like the first love, "unforgettable to forget."
I remember perfectly.
It was a pants, a shirt, a "gilette" vest and a vest from the 1971-1972 Fall-Winter Collection.
"It was a gift he had given me," said Naty Abascal, one of the couture's museums.
"I prefer him to all others for his femininity, his great love of women, and because he sublimes our beauty," adds the former Duchess of Feria.
I really like the colors he uses, they're bright and light up his face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and moderate Patricia della Giomppaola d'Arenberg cannot, nor can she forget the first time she has worn a Valentino model.
When she was a teenager and lived in Italy, she dreamed of having the age and opportunity to wear one of her evening dresses...
Finally, this was possible in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino model for a party in my cousin's castle, Prince Edouard of Line.
It was a red evening dress, with a flying skirt, a strapped buster and a slipper to fall off.
"It was a dream come true," said the widow of Rodrigue d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, he is obsessed with timeless," explains the Italian aristocrat who shares his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess of Arenberg retains the couture's evening dresses with "the greatest care, because a night dress is not only a dress, it is also all the memories she's driving".
The "king" of fashion
The grand finale of the Somerset House exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress during her marriage to Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "girls" (the couture thus calls its seams) to make this dress in ivory silk with incrustations of pearls, twelve different types of laces and a four and a half meters train.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the specialized press, this dress represents a historical fact of the high seas of the late 20th century, "the return of the customers of the high society".
Over the years by the "know-being" of nobility, Valentino is now his best representative.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the greatest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani cumulates as many honours as any of his clients.
"His refinement, his calmness, his neat and perfect appearance have always jumped me in the eye," says Arenberg.
Last time I saw him, it was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée d'Orsay.
He was sitting at the table of Countess Jacqueline of Ribes, one of my great friends.
"He was impeccable, years have no effect on him."
If it's a princess who says it...
The hardest job in the world: the human mules of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, Indonesian volcano carriers risk their lives and health by carrying 70 kilos of sulphur through steep stone trails.
There are people for whom work is a hell and others who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 minors who earn their lives by carrying the sulphur of the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
He must work every day to the bottom of the crater, where the sulphur gas emanating from the entrances of the earth solidifies to the contact of the air.
After harvesting large sulphur rocks, which weigh almost 70 kilos in total, he installs them in two bamboo baskets that he loads on his shoulders through the steep paths.
It's only 250 meters to the top of the volcano that peaks at 2,386 meters of altitude, but the exhausted carriers take more than 40 minutes to gravitate this distance, at a tortoise, keeping the balance and measuring their steps so as not to stumble and fall into the precipice.
They know that a false step could cost their lives, as it happened to a French tourist who made a deadly fall in the Kawah Ijen volcano several years ago.
Kawah Ijen minors earn 5 cents of euro for each kilo of sulphur extracted.
Once up, he breaks a path between the tourists who photograph them as if they were circus animals, and carrying painfully heavy baskets, they walk the 3 kilometers to the balance that a mining company has installed a little under 1,850 meters of altitude.
It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been operating the volcano since 1960 and, you can say, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents euros) per kilogram of sulphur.
It then sells it to 10,000 rupees (83 cents euros) to the petrochemical industry as this ore is very present in daily life and is used to manufacture candles, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even serves to bleach sugar.
"As we carry about 70 kilos, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) on each trip," explains Anto, who usually makes three trips a day.
Each takes 3 hours and is exhausted, but this allows him to earn 138,000 rupees (11,50 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems to be a misery for such a superhuman effort, it is the triple of what it would gain in the fields.
"The income of minors is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros) per day and where the average monthly wage is two million rupees (167 euros)", says the carrier who once worked as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.20 euros) per day and the job was not as difficult, but Anto returned to his family in Banyuwangi, a village close to the volcano, for a reason that, in Indonesia, is as indisputable as the sulfur: "I married a young girl from Bali, where they are Hinduists, and I brought her back to Java to convert to Islam".
Then he suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At the age of 27, he spent three of his life challenging the danger on the Kawah ljen, but the sulfur has already begun to make him pay the bill although he covers his face with a mask and wears special gloves.
Then he suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases rejected by the volcano.
It's the price he has to pay to pursue his dream.
"I will work another two years, because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French," he promises in more than acceptable English.
Mistaken by life, this friendly and intelligent young man could be a tourist guide, server or receptionist in a hotel, but instead he does the job of a mule.
He shares an unhealthy wood measure with other carriers, wakes up every day at two o'clock in the morning because the sulfur keeps leaking at night, when its characteristic yellow color becomes blue and shines in the middle of the darkness.
Defying the darkness, Then descend into the crater by lighting up with a small lamp attached to his helmet, that he bought himself with his own money.
Some 400 carriers load the sulphur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater.
Despite its comfortable profits, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of sulphur to save costs and does not provide any equipment to the carriers who work on their behalf and are paid by weight.
In addition, they also do not touch one under the 30,000 rupees (250 euros) of increase by camera, in addition to the entrance of 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros), that the guards of this nature park charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This work is done for animals, not for humans," protestes Madrusin, a 42-year-old body carrier who has been working in Kawah Ijen for 30 years since he left college.
Capable of carrying up to 110 kilos, he ensures that he will not stop working "as long as he can", because he needs money to raise his 3 sons, aged between 10 and 18.
I won't retire, I'll die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although the sulfur damages the throat and irritates the eyes when the wind turns and traps the minors in thick columns of smoke that come out of the volcano, they are so hardened that no one complains of suffering from serious diseases... to which obviously are added their usual respiratory problems, arthrosis, pain in the knees and shoulders, deformed by the weight of the baskets.
By balancing the basket on his back, Unainik, aged 53, can only load 50 kilos.
Every day, his companions and they extract 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which three trucks carry to the Tamasari warehouse, 18 kilometres from there by a goat trail invaded by the weeds.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life," says Unainik by opening his mouth well, revealing several missing teeth.
The elder of his five children, 30 years of age, also works as a sulphur carrier.
Time passes, but perpetual misery from generation to generation is one of the most difficult jobs in the world: the one that makes the human mules of the Kawah ljen volcano.
Singapore looking for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans place the responsibility for this absence of children on the career, stress and cost of access to property.
"The population of Singapore must develop."
I am a husband and a patriot, you are my wife and a patriot, let's do our civic duty and give life!
It may seem imaginable that these words come from an advertising for mint pills, but despite this, or perhaps thanks to this, the video has spread like a dust trail on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
The words come from a rap group that uses local references such as "Allon put a polykine in the drawer" to mock Singapore's birth rate.
BBH, the advertising agency at the origin of the video, hopes to draw attention to the problem in a fun way thanks to this advertising.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music to get people to "their national duty".
It is intended only for the Internet, so we have been able to make it fun and fun.
This is the main problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the area of birth, so we felt that it was a theme we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried many things like throwing perfumes at pheromones or organizing speed-dating evenings.
Many of these ideas were creative but they did not necessarily work.
So we said the following: what is more creative to solve this problem than to make a rap song?
1.2 children
The Government of Singapore does not take that lightly.
It spends US$1,300 a year in politics to encourage its citizens to have more children.
A government measure for marriages and fathers grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all of this has had little effect.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
Singapore's birth rate, in line with its national population distribution, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2, considered to be the rate of renewal, it was in 1976.
Why, then, do Singaporeans not have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policy of the National Population Division, says it is due to "better education" and "a wider choice of career opportunities".
"This has enabled people to have a wider range of options in terms of goals of life and priorities, beyond marriage and the creation of a family," she explains.
These changes in social standards have contributed to an increase in the number of unmarried people and delay marriage and birth, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
In the meantime, an immigration policy aimed at radically increasing immigration to counter the decline of the population has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites that are simply disguised into xenophobia against new immigrants, particularly Chinese people who are accused of pulling wages down and not integrating.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the party in Singapore has experienced last year its worst election results since independence.
Since the elections, they have tried to correct the problem with the introduction of higher quotas and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the decline in the birth rate has known effects on a country's economic growth, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore's example also has unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to avoid the construction of many small houses.
For example, this began to affect the real estate sector.
Urban development authorities have begun to control the number of small apartments known as "shoe box", which can be built in specific areas of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and their sale is very successful.
However, the authorities are concerned that they can promote a single lifestyle and discourage promoters from wanting to build large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of the EL Developers real estate company, claims that its "shoe boxes" sell much faster than larger housing.
They are more popular, in the sense that these dwellings are built much faster than those larger.
For this reason, it is much more cost-effective for our cash.
However, he admits that the new standards provide clearer guidance to promoters, who were previously put on wheels if they wanted to offer too many small housing in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a state city.
If these new regulations could be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, discussing with Singaporeans working in the financial district of the centre, it would appear that they will not have much effect.
"People are very stressed, homes are expensive, just like education, that's why people give it back later," says a young manager.
Other people may have children.
"But for me, it's important to be able to have my money and my time," another youth in about twenty years tells us.
Men and women mention their career, stress and cost of access to property and education as the reasons why they prevent them from having children.
Thus, although the government tries to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, it is the Singaporeans themselves who have the last word.
What is private offline is private online
Confidentiality
According to the Spanish Royal Academy Dictionary, it is the quality of the private domain or "the field of private life that we can protect from any intrusion".
What is the private domain for under 16 years?
How can this definition be applied in everyday life and on social networks?
Does he understand the dangers to which he exposes himself by disseminating events that he would certainly not share offline on the Internet?
The newspaper elPeriodico interviewed five young boys, between 10 and 15 years old, frequent users of the canvas.
In four of the cases, they associated the term "something very personal" in the personal sense and "password and username" when applying it to social networks.
"I won't reveal my most personal secrets in a post," says Jorge, ten years old, when he tries to explain the meaning of the private term on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has an account for two years.
"These are very secret secrets, my mother may know them but not everyone," he says.
On FB, I put nice pictures or games.
I'm also talking to my friends.
"I won't share one of my photos or someone who would do the stupid thing," he says.
The young boy admits that it is wrong to publish obscene photos, naked people, crimes or write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge ensures he knows his 35 friends on FB as well as his nine subscribers on Twitter.
The majority are family.
Her mother is part of it, she knows the password of one of the accounts.
I opened a Twitter account to express and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just put them on," he says.
"Social networks are fun, I can talk to distant parents or friends, quickly," he says.
He claims that he would never accept the request of an unknown person.
Nor will he trust anyone who would recommend a stranger to him.
The case of José, 14 years old, is different.
The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, on the latter, he admits not to know 20 of the people on his list of friends.
"I'm not worried about this because we have something in common, music for example," he says.
According to the young boy, no one made advances to him or asked him for his address or phone number.
"If they put pressure on me or demanded it, I would just delete them from my account," he admits.
José subscribed to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The experiences we know today under the name cyberharvest are not foreign to the young boy.
A friend of one of my friends was hacked into a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was," he says.
The victim, according to José, did not close his account.
"He just passed it in private."
He then explains to us a series of manipulations to set up his account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this young person would post photos of knowledge in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would if I was angry or angry.
"Even if I know it's cyber harassment," he says.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, professor of English and licensed in Education and Learning, considers that, in order to guide children and adolescents, it must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet has emerged as a means of searching for information but, with the appearance of these sites, the rule of the game has changed," she said.
Porras reports that academic Marc Prensky, who holds a master's degree in pedagogy at Yale University and author of the book "Natives and Digital Immigrants", uses these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives are children and young people born with technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who have to teach them there, while we are learning ourselves," she says.
He adds that the theme is complex, "because we ask them to have a defined criterion on what should or should not be disclosed, published or said at an age when they do not have the maturity necessary to do so."
"We also ask them to be selective when what matters most is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," she adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach confidentiality to children and adolescents is to use questions that make them reflect.
"Tell them not to do it is useless," she says.
Then, Porras lists some examples: there are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or would you like them to publish a picture of you like that of a friend you published?
Do you know what others publish on you?
When you identify holiday photos, do you ask other people to identify them?
And also, does everyone need to know what you're doing every moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they must act online as they do offline.
Those are the same rules.
"On the Internet, everyone must act with respect, morality and other principles, this must be the same on social networks," she says.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, professor of university, primary teacher and educational advisor, states that it is essential for parents to read consciously the conditions of use of social networks.
By understanding each of the terms, they will have solid basis to discuss with their children the implications of an online account.
"For example, age and what is allowed to share or publish," he says.
According to Guardia, it is essential to remind children that they should not speak to strangers.
The summit of Unasur ended without the release of the Lima Declaration
The 6th Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) concluded today in Peru without the fact that the Lima Declaration was made public, although it was previously announced and theoretically adopted by the 7 representatives present.
Ephe tried several times to access the document signed at the 6th Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency initially reported that it would be disclosed after the close of the summit and then stated that it would be published from time to time on the Peruvian government's website.
When they were questioned about the text, they reported that its content had been presented by the President of Peru, Ollante Humala, in brief press statements.
The access of journalists to information on the summit has been constantly limited.
During the day, only the video without the sound of the presidential assembly with the message "private session, restricted audio" was broadcast in the press room.
The limited information circulated among journalists was that given by the press officers of some of the governments of Unasur who attended the meeting, with the exception of the Peruvian spokesman.
The only document released during the day was the list of the presidents present, which caused some malaise among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media calling for more important information.
Later, the Presidency of Peru sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it was President Humala's speech and not the official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru was the host of the third Arab South American Summit (ASPA) and, on that occasion, although this was requested by the press on an urgent basis, it had also not circulated the declaration also called the Lima Declaration, as previously announced.
On the official ASPA website, it can be verified that the document was published last March.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities tried to establish safe transmission systems for all journalists, but they limited the availability of information to the maximum.
The summit also concluded with the joint agreement between Chile and Peru to accept a judgment by the Hague Court which sets a different border between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met at the regional meeting and declared that they would respect the ICJ's decision to hear the arguments of both parties in the trial Lima tried against Santiago and which begins on Monday in The Hague.
"We will respect and execute the verdict that will resolve the disputes we are bringing before this international court today," said President Humala, next to his Chilean counterpart.
"Chili has always been, and will continue to be, a country that respects international law, peaceful resolution of disputes, treaties and international tribunals," President Piñera added by handing President Humala, alongside the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of the two presidents that they would submit to the ICJ took place after Colombia had denounced this week the Bogota Pact by which it had agreed to submit itself to the decisions of that international tribunal, after a decision on the maritime limits with Nicaragua that it considered to be gravely wrong.
The summit was held without the presence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the removal of its former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was charged with opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The representative read out the outcome document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that the lines of action of 31 projects had been set between South American countries for a total of $17 million in investment.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the countries of Unasur would put in place "significant steps to achieve the goal of South American citizenship through the development of residence permits agreements".
He reported that actions would be put in place to improve "cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and international organized crime, actions to improve drug accessibility, low-priced Internet access throughout South America, and to jointly and effectively assess the risks of natural disasters".
With a Europe in crisis, "economic consolidation (Latin America) must not have a triumphalist matrix but must help to increase our productive matrix and to see a better future for our people," concluded President Humala.
"We have decided to give priority to a group of 31 emblematic projects that improve the connection of South America's spaces, particularly in rural and border areas... by uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits," said the Peruvian President in a speech.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five concerned Peru and were on the transversal axes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two aimed at a more important connection with Ecuador although it did not provide further details.
Similarly, the final document mentions the political situation of Paraguay.
"We hope that this country's electoral process will allow for its reintegration into the Union of South American Nations," which is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and in good relations with its neighbours, is another theme discussed at the summit.
In this regard, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos stated, before the regional meeting began, that he hoped to meet his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, the following Saturday in Mexico to discuss the maritime dispute calmly through a judgment of the ICJ requested by Bogota.
"It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday), I have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," said President Santos.
"We are going to review all these ways, they are not exhaustive, including the treaty with Nicaragua that will ask for a discussion with Nicaragua," he said.
"I hope I can tell President Ortega that we will deal with this in the most civilized and respectful manner possible," said President Santos.
Presidents Santos and Ortega will meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they plan to attend the takeover of power of the new president of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Similarly, within the framework of the summit, the Ministers of Defence of the bloc will meet in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus in terms of defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are part of Unasur, although the latter country is suspended.
Peru holds the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from Europe how to integrate citizenship," says Rafael Correa.
Ecuador's President, Rafael Correa, stated today that the creation of a common citizenship was an objective for which "South America, in this case, had to take an example of Europe".
President Correa, who took part in the 6th Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), located in Lima, said on State TV, Peru TV, that Europeans "were engaged in the Second World War" and in other conflicts, "but now they were almost a homeland".
In this regard, he defended the project to establish South American citizenship encouraged by the member countries of Unasur.
"We must achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as already is the case for members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary areas that we want to bring into the past," he warned.
In addition, the Ecuadorian President supported the reconstitution of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the aim of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account the signatories to the San José Covenant on Human Rights.
Those who beat our ears never compromise, on the contrary, we South Americans have all signed it.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is located in Washington under US funding," he said, referring to Ecuador's political asylum to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa ensures that he does not regret his decision, because he has not betrayed his principles himself, but has respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He concluded that at the time, "there were well-founded suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that his trial would not be respected."
Furthermore, he criticizes Swedish justice which required him to submit himself to an interrogation on his territory concerning a suspected sexual offence while "Sweden legislation allows him to do so by videoconferencing, which could be done since Ecuador's Embassy in London".
Correa stated that there was a risk that Assange's mental and physical health would deteriorate.
"I haven't spoken to him since he was in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a little lung problem, but nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian president.
It is possible that his physical and mental health may deteriorate due to being confined in a small space without being able to exercise in the open air.
"This acts on the health of anyone," he concludes.
Correa points out that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian Embassy of London, which would be the assignment of a driver who would allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities, and he stresses that he has had discussions in London in order to find a solution to the imprisonment of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use this word in this case, but there have been permanent discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, has launched a whole series of proceedings with different European bodies," he said.
And he thinks that "if Britain were to grant the safe driving tomorrow, it would end."
And if Sweden, as its legislation really permits, and as it has already done in other cases, questioned Mr Assange at the Embassy of Ecuador in London, or questioned him through Skype tomorrow, the problem would also be resolved.
Correa took advantage of this to reaffirm himself as a defender of the freedom of the press and he said that what he did not tolerate was "the mediocrity, the bad faith and the lies that impair freedom of expression".
"The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not malicious or perverse politicians but bad journalists at the balance of greed, blackmail and extortion," he said.
From this point of view, he welcomed the fact that this is not a type of journalist "neither the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador" and, instead of putting forward his re-election, "it would deepen the revolution to pursue the path and trace the right path".
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto on Paraguay within Unasur at least until the next elections, arguing that the organization "should be firm and not tolerate opportunism and attempted coup d'état disguised", because in reality, "it destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
Moreover, the Ecuadorian President considers the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries through the judgment of the International Court of The Hague, which will strengthen Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty.
For the moment, this judgment is not respected.
This is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to move forward together.
We need to solve them as a whole to get past them and move on.
At the same time, he expressed his confidence in the correct resolution of the dispute concerning the maritime borders between Peru and Chile within the same court and stated that it was "beneficial for Latin America to seize international forums if both countries agreed to accept a judgment so firmly as it may be".
Referring to the possibility of his presentation as a candidate for future presidential elections in Ecuador, with a view to bridging a third consecutive mandate, he noted that he saw this possibility "with much optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite difficult".
Correa assured that if he lost the primary ones in February 2013, he would withdraw from public life.
At the personal level, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unjust as those of Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be resolved through political power.
"My political movement thought it was me who guaranteed this possible victory but we must accept this responsibility," he said.
If I win, it would be my last presidential term and I will then withdraw from political life.
If we ever forgive, I will.
"It's my decision," he said.
Correa also referred to the new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just talked to Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro and he told me that routine medical treatment was already planned and he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean a fall in President Chávez's health status," he commented.
The Ecuadorian Head of State participated today in Lima at the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) which ended with a call for better regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS-related deaths are now due to late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed as a result of the test: HIV positive.
"It is as if the sky had fallen on my head," he said by referring to the time of the announcement, that the doctor had tried to make "less painful", in vain.
The young man hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to inform himself about his illness and his caressing was such that he had just celebrated his 43rd anniversary.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit in Guadalajara civilian hospital (HCG), in which he met in 1994 after many battles.
Fabrizio has lived with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 1990s, where there were many doubts, little choice of treatment and more stigmats.
So even the director of an IMSS clinic prevented him from saying goodbye "because he was voiceless."
At that time, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and have a good quality of life.
However, ignoring their disease, many people still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, "exhausted" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, in all cases after the first reported cases, "the great victory is today that the survival of a patient who started treatment at the appropriate time and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," said HCG's HIV unit leader Jaime Andrade Villanueva and he takes as reference that this information was validated in April this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectiologist and HIV/AIDS expert Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS was no longer a deadly disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depended on the level of allocation of the immune system that patients had at the time of diagnosis, with better prospects for those who did not consume drugs: up to 30 years for a CD4 rate of 200 and up to 50 years for those reaching a rate of 500 CD4.
To speak simply, it means that for someone who would receive a positive 25-year-old HIV diagnosis, "as long as he remains under control, he can live without problems up to 75 years," the interrogated scientist explained.
In order to replace this progress in its context, it is necessary to know that the life expectancy of Mexicans is now 76 years on average.
While mortality has significantly decreased in recent years, in Mexico, the number of people who died from AIDS has increased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (according to the UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that since the onset of AIDS, 60% of patients registered on the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and 187 died until May of this year; however, we are assured that access to antiretroviral drugs has been universal since 2005.
So why is there still death?
I don't think the problem comes from access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's what happened in our hospital.
Over the past 12 years at least, we have never lacked medication, the problem is that patients arrive at very advanced stages because they do not know that they are infected, or they learn it at advanced stages of the disease.
It gives us an indisputable fact "nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have an opportunistic infection, what it takes to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to carry out earlier diagnoses and, for this, to offer massive testing tests to all people who ask for it."
Specialists and members of the State AIDS Prevention Council of Jalisco (Coesida) agree on its proposal, as well as patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who had to do their testing in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had done it and, despite his youth, he was already AIDS bearer and suffered from Kapsi's sarcoma, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you learn that you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die and they don't want to know anything.
"If I'm going to die, I better break up three times a week," they say, that's not my case.
The change has been beneficial, I eat well, I do exercise, I take my medication.
To date, his parents only know that he is suffering from cancer.
I have a normal life, just like anyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active sexual life, but co-responsibly, I pay attention to myself and the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to help, thanks to his testimony, those who fear today, during the World AIDS Day march.
If they do the test, if they take risks, the sooner they will know if they are HIV-positive and better it will be, and if they already have the diagnosis, they must know that we can live like everyone else, being responsible.
His message summarizes the slogan of the battle against AIDS in this year 2012.
Preservatives on the counter
There are many gaps between health programs and ordinary citizens, said Ricardo Salazar, a Guadalajara journalist who embraced the cause of HIV.
And the greatest is prevention.
In all places dedicated to this, "we have actually increased the distribution of condoms, before we were given one or two, now we are given packages of a hundred, it is very good, but as a result, that today, some still do not have access to condoms," he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
The question: "What are you going to do?", posed with sarcasm and valuable judgments by social workers, guidance counselors, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that adolescents do not want to hear, says the journalist.
He proposed reorienting this ineffective distribution; that condoms not only be sold to counters, but that they be found in public toilet distributors and in the places where young people attend.
It is not about encouraging promiscuity.
Nor was it about paying the girls and the motel, as Governor Emilio González had responded when asked whether there would be a distribution of condoms within his administration.
"This is not how sexuality works, it is best to provide condoms to people already sexually active," he said.
The figures in Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 of AIDS and 1,317 of HIV).
The State is the 4th State of the country in number of new and accumulated cases of AIDS and 13th cases for the number of HIV patients.
92% of the infections are sexual, 6% by blood and 2% by perinatal route.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV, since in each case there are 4 or 5 people who are unaware of HIV.
A ruling ratified by a U.S. court ignores the restructuring of the debt of the Vitro group through a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico. The scenario leads to a bad precedent for all national companies with ramifications in the neighbouring country and with solvency problems.
It appears, therefore, that the survival procedures of companies authorized by Mexican laws are not valid in the country under the star banner, contrary to international agreements.
From a practical point of view, the judgment rendered on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale of the Court of Bankruptcy for the Northern District of Texas leaves Mexican companies without defence in the face of the possibility of blocking their property beyond Bravo.
However, the resolution will allow Mexico's main glass manufacturer to refer to the United States Supreme Court on the basis of three inconsistencies.
First, while the case judge points out that creditors must register according to the United States Bankruptcy Act, the fifth-circuit appeal court, based in New Orleans, states that the main proceedings are the formalized commercial bankruptcy in Mexico.
The first point would involve denouncing international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of transnational corporations.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law for the Uniformity of International Trade Law had been established for this purpose by taking the American Law Institute as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment provides that without the inter-corporate vote, recognised in the critical mass of commercial bankruptcy, the debts contracted by Vitro's subsidiaries to the parent company, the majority required for the approval of the restructuring could not have been obtained.
However, Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, the case of Vitro is not the first to use this plan.
Here there are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Commercial Mexicana, whose Federal Institute of Commercial Banks had secured debts.
Moreover, what is certain is that, since the votes of the subsidiaries remained, in all ways the Vitro creditors who fought against this in the United States courts, i.e. the "valutour" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, would not have obtained the majority.
The vote would have been 45 votes against 37.
A data is omitted by the court of appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro was blamed for the difficult situation he had experienced since 2008 without stopping from the serious economic crisis faced by the United States, affecting the country's costs.
For the time being, the society of the González Sada family will appeal to the same court of appeal for the vote to take place in its entirety, i.e. with the five judges, since only three had voted.
The use of insurance will demand non-prosperity and require the review of the trial by a higher court, in this case the United States Supreme Court of Justice.
The most serious is that the court ignored a document sent by the Government of Mexico on behalf of the amicus curiae ("friend of the Court") in which Vitro's procedure under the Commercial Bankruptcy Act was detailed, noting that it was releasing it from the conventions signed by both countries to bring it to the same level as paragraph 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Act.
In addition, he pointed out that the country had adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules for cross-border insolvency cases, which ensured equity for debtors and creditors.
Carabolage of two parts: they look like Vitro and they look like the country.
General budget
The complaints of the Mexican Aviation Society's trade unions against the former employer of the company, Gastón Azcarraga Andrade, were silent for several months, he was accused of fraudulent administration, the Association of Air Pilots has already encountered problems.
The court, headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has just filed a criminal application against the National Banking Commission and the Values which is accused of obstruction of justice.
According to him, the inspection authority systematically denied that it provided information to the Attorney General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the contractor to withdraw from Bank IXE F/589 198 million pesos on behalf of the Mexicana de Aviación.
The funds would have been used for the purchase of shares of the Professional Hotel Administration.
As everyone knows, Azcarraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
They sit on the Dragon Mars
Meeting at a weekend in an amphitheatre of the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, university professors, entrepreneurs and members of civil society approved the creation of a broad front of opposition to the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
As you know, we are talking about a colossal sales and distribution centre in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from the large wall country, with a housing area for employees of 150 companies.
Previously, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of Industry and Transformation) had succeeded in uniting the governors of the Southeast region to oppose the monumental project that is partly on protected areas and represents the greatest threat to the industry.
ACTA's dead.
The government has put forward a Senate requirement to explain under what terms and circumstances the Ambassador of Mexico to Japan had signed the Anti-Contraface Trade Agreement, known under its English acronym ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property, this theme is already of ancient history.
As everyone knows, it has been successful that the Senate itself condemned this possibility, as it was regarded as an infringement of freedom of expression on social networks.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes "The basketball is my whole life"
The world-troctor of the "Hetin" Reyes basketball has spent more than 60 years of his life in relation to the field and, thanks to him, has traveled all over the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have knowledge of the history of local basketball as large as Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
The reason is that before a brain hemorrhage condemns him to the wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in this sport for more than 60 years, whether as a lower league player, player of the national basketball team, manager and leader of the national team, BSN, with the Bayamón Vaqueros or as president of the basketball federation.
"I have worn several helmets in basketball throughout my life, and even several at the same time, as when I was president of the BSN, director general of the national team and president of the federation during the 1990s," recalls Reyes during a visit of Primera Hora to his home in Bayamón, where he has lived with Isabel, his faithful wife for over 50 years.
"The basketball is my whole life."
Reyes does not exaggerate when he makes this statement.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memories that recall his route without standards, testify.
Bayamón in the heart
Of all his memories, those he loves most are those who remind him of his passage as a player in the Vaqueros team in the mid-50s to 1982, after having spent 15 years as a co-manager or team manager.
"This was my best years, the ones I enjoyed most because I had the chance to participate in eight Vaqueros championships since 1967, whether as manager, co-manager or leader.
This has been a great deal of satisfaction for many years, including the five championships held from 1971 to 1975.
I then retired from the championship in 1981, the year Jerome Mincy joined the team of the BSN.
From there, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, took the lead of the team," says Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had been a leader here and who was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me: "I have a Costa Rican player for you, he measures two meters.
Do you want it?"
That's how Mincy began, one of the best players Puerto Rico had.
Bartow then recommended Raymond Gausse, who was naturalized and was one of the best shooters.
I remember saying that if Mincy had allowed Bayamon to win a championship, Gausse would help us try to win another one.
He welcomed the Vaqueros Championship with Gausse, but only at a distance since in 1988 he was already the great manateu of the federation.
At the time, he preferred to take advantage of his duties and those of Mincy on the national team.
I remember when we first won it in the United States at the Pre-Olympic Tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then there was the 1990 World Cup, where we arrived 4th and where we should have won the bronze medal if this Canadian judge had not made us play the last game, Reyes said.
Is the 1990 World Cup team the best national team you've ever seen?
She is one of the best, just like the one who beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympic Games.
But my favorite is that of the Cuban Pan-American Games in 1991, when we won the gold and we put a hold on the U.S. team, which was quite similar to the one that had won the bronze during the World.
This team was not only composed of Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), there were also the young (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to attend the world of 90 due to a knee problem.
A team that may not have been the best in terms of individuals, but it gave us a gold medal and great joy at the Pre-Olympic tournament in Neuquén in Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and young Rolando Hourruitiner in place of players suspended by the Imbroglio of the Pan American Games of Mar del Plata, we won the gold against all the predictions.
What was Puerto Rico's best player?
This is undoubtedly Piculín Ortiz.
Its international tournament statistics are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level as Piculín did.
And this does not take into account his path in the different leagues for which he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's very hard to say.
We had a good team composed of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
In young people, I really like the work Leo Arill does.
For you, what is your greatest success in the federation?
Having been part of the most glorious period of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that in the early 1990s, the NSA had up to 17 teams in one season.
What do you have to do?
There are things I would have wanted to put in place, such as regionalization of minor categories.
For example, the Ponce boys only play in their area and face only teams from other parts of the island during national playoffs.
Today, young people travel and play too much when this is not necessarily necessary.
I have at least seen the benefit of mandatory certifications and courses for leaders, field staff and referees.
That makes me happy.
What are you doing today?
In general, I listen to music, I watch videos from my time on YouTube, I enjoy my grandchildren and, from time to time, I attend basketball games.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Death of actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth (Texas), became known worldwide for the role of John Ross Ewing, better known as J.R., in the television series "Dallas", in which he embodied a businessman without scruples, fearless and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as an unscrupulous oil magnet J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who had returned this year to J.R's role in a new "Dallas" season, died Friday evening from complications of cancer, according to a family statement sent to The Associated Press for Warner Bros., production house of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, playing again the ironic role he loved most," said the family.
Larry's family and his close friends were with him in Dallas on this Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played her wife's role in the original series and later, was with Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital, said his press deputy, Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, affectionate and talented, and I will miss him a lot.
"He was an exceptional person and he lived his whole life," Gray said in a statement.
The doctors had diagnosed liver cirrhosis in Larry Hagman in 1992 and had acknowledged that he had been drinking a lot for many years.
In 1995, he was detected with a malignant tumor in his liver and had a graft.
Several years before "Dallas", Hagman was introduced to television in the role of an ordinary type in the "Jinny of My Dreams" series broadcast by the NBC channel from 1965 to 1970.
In it he interpreted the role of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed when he discovered an attractive genius, interpreted by Barbara Eden, and brought her home.
He also played in two comedies that remained short in the antenna, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
Amongst his roles in cinema are roles well received by critics in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was thanks to his master's interpretation of the delightfully detestable J.R. that Larry Hagman had his greatest success.
The drama series of the CBS channel on the Ewing clan and its neighbours was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "Who killed J.R.?", invented to maintain the suspension around an episode full of emotions in which the character of Hagman was almost murdered, generated speculations around the world and millions of dollars played in bets.
As a result, among other things, the series reached a record of hearings at that time.
When the answer was revealed in an episode of November 1980, 41 million viewers were on average in front of their screen and made "Dallas" the second most watched entertainment program in the world, after the final episode of "MASH" in 1983, which had gathered 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law, Kristin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. had pregnant her and then threatened to accuse her of prostitution if she did not leave the city, but other people also had reason to assault her.
Hagman played the role of Ewing as a corrupt and insatiable man but with a charismatic smile: a dishonest entrepreneur and an unfaithful wife who tried to internalize her alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what should be as an epitaph for J.R," Hagman said in 1988.
We should write: "This is the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
Here's the only part he lost.
Victoria Principal, co-protagonist of the original series, remembered this Friday of Hagman as a "great man, both on the small screen and in life".
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans throughout the world, and in the heart of each one of us, who had the chance to know and love it.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
Five episodes have already been recorded for the second season and a sixth is being completed, the chain has been informed.
For the time being, neither Warner nor the TNT channel have reported how Hagman's death will be integrated into the series.
Originally from Fort Worth in Texas, he is the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who knows the celebrity with classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Mary Martin was still a teenager when she gave him the day in 1931 while she was married to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He took his first steps on the theatre scenes of New York in the early 1950s and served in the 1952 to 1956 air force in England.
That's where he met the young Swedish interior decorator Maj Axelsson and he married him.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived many years in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life" (in French: Hello Darlin': J.R.'s pitiable memoirs)
"I didn't write anything in this book that could hurt someone or affect him in any way," he told the press at that time.
After his liver transplant, he became an active organ donation activist and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist patients with anxiety.
"I advise them, I restore their trust, I come with them when they come to operate and after," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to offer them some comfort, like, "Don't be afraid, it won't be easy for a while, but it's gonna be okay."
He was also a tobacco activist and participated in several campaigns.
A course dealing with the "End of the World" has just begun
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and climate warming.
This semester, when Stuart Charmé decided to give a course on the end of the world, he knew that he was launching an irresistible hammock: the end of the "great count" of the Maya calendar on December 21, which many refer to as proof of the end of the imminent world.
But Professor Charmé had no idea what expected him in the following months: Hurricane Hurricane Sandy, a tax gulf that some called the "Debate Army" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christian theorists at the end of the time thought the apocalypse would start.
"I didn't realize that this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester I've ever known," Professor Charmé told his students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey) this week.
If we look at what happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and we were talking about it, it was a very good time.
And remember that what is bad is good for those who believe in the apocalypse.
And he is not the only teacher to teach courses on "the end of the world" this semester, which will, in theory, be the last of history.
In Temple, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker holds the "Media, Culture and the End of the World" course.
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and climate warming.
"We analyze this because these ideas proliferate over time," he said, and the way they offer hypothetical scenarios guides a certain human behavior.
If nuclear weapons fell into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could explode.
This month, students will analyze movies with apocalyptic themes and study how they can be compared with examples of real life.
"I tried to inform my students about what was possible, probable, credible and impossible," Vacker said.
On the main campus of the University of State of Pennsylvania, the Professor of History of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an Assistant Professor of History of Art and Anthropology, teamed up to give a course, simply called "The End of the World".
"We add "2012" to have the opportunity to give the course again, in case the world would not disappear," said Professor Restall.
Despite the "near disaster", students must study, create projects and pass their final exams.
In the State of Pennsylvania, the final examination will be on the eve of Revelation, which leaves students no choice but to work "until the very night of the end of the supposed world," said Restall.
Courses have proved to be quite popular.
"It was completed in two hours," said Restall about his course for high-level students, consisting of 35 students.
We received e-mail messages several weeks before the start of the semester, from people who asked if there was still room.
Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It fascinates me to see what people are able to do to comfort themselves," says Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, University of Rutgers-Camden.
For the fear of Revelation, whether secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort, or of lack of comfort.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student in Psychology and Nursing, claims to have seen all the apocalyptic films.
"I had never heard of a course that taught this subject," he said.
I appreciate it.
But none of the students interviewed, and even less a teacher, told us to believe at the end of the world of December 21.
"Our first project was about Mayan prophecy, and we somehow discredited it," says Julie zegle, a senior student from the last year in Temple, aged 21 and from West Chester.
The Maya never predicted the end of the world, it is only a key date on the calendar," said Restall.
But I agree that there is anxiety related to apocalypse in Western culture, dating back to several centuries, which causes people to react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has sparked such speculation.
"In other places on the globe, people don't think about it," he says.
This is mostly the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, responded quickly when asked if he knew that "the end of the world" was being taught here.
"The Philippines does not participate at the end of the world," he replied, as if it were an exception from a superior authority.
We have a grace from the Pope.
Restall notes that over the years, we have talked about the many supposed dates of the last judgment, and he states that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately begin to think about the next date" or philosopher about the fact that December 21 marks the beginning of a seven-year period at the end of which the world will disappear.
Students and teachers take the date lightly.
Several told us they were planning to go to "end of the world" parties.
"Sometimes I call friends and we laugh together," commented Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
