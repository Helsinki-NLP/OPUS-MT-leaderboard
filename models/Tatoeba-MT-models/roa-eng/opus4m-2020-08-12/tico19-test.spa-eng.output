Cumulative incidence of rapidly increasing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union or the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows similar trends in the countries of the European Union or the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, confirming that, although at different stages according to the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly across all countries.
Based on the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should improve their preparation for a wave of patients with COVID-19 who will require medical care and in particular intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a cluster of cases of unknown etiology pneumonia was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention of China reported that the causing agent was a new coronavirus now known as coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronary artery disease (COVID-19).
The evidence to date indicates that 80% of people with COVID-19 have a mild disease, i.e. a respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, and that most of them recover.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 evolves into a more serious disease requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% of cases develop a critical disease requiring intensive care.
Mortality in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we examine trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each country of the European Union or the European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compare them with those in the province of Hubei, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK with Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the UK
After China, COVID-19 continued to spread geographically and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world now follow that of this country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In the edition of 5 March 2020 Eurosurveillance, Spiteri et al. reported on the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe in accordance with the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were registered in France on 24 January 2020, in persons returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As at 15 March 2020, cases of COVID-19 had been detected in the 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (RU), according to which between 31 December 2019 and that inclusive date, 39 768 cases and 1727 deaths had been recorded, of which 17,750 cases and 1441 deaths had occurred in Italy only.
Obtaining the cumulative amount and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), reports of COVID-19 cases reported in each country in the world, obtained only from official sources, such as the Ministry of Health of countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO, are updated daily at 8:00 a.m.
These data were used to examine the trends of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK and to compare them with that of Italy.
As an indicator of the prevalence of active cases of COVID-19, we calculated the cumulative incidence of cases of COVID-19 truncated to 14 days; thus, we took into account the natural course of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA country and the UK, during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also present the cumulative number of cases reported in each country at 8:00 a.m. as compared with Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Trends in COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the UK
Trends in the cumulative incidence of 14-day COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK, in general, followed that of Hubei Province, China (Figure 1).
In the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase by around 21 February and then increased significantly by 28 February 2020 (additional material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of reported cases in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK showed upward trends in the cumulative incidence of similar COVID-19 (additional material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK, compared to Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
He stressed that, by 15 March at 8:00 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had already registered a total number of cases comparable to that of Italy only 3 weeks before or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported COVID-19 cases is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Trends in the cumulative incidence of VOCID-19 suggest that the pandemic is progressing at a similar pace in all countries.
This is so despite the different stages in which countries are located, variations in national public health responses and possibly different case definitions in countries and protocols to select patients who must be tested to confirm COVID-19, including delayed tests.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy described a situation where 10% of patients with COVID-19 required intensive care, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on admissions of COVID-19 cases to a hospital or intensive care unit are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6 % and 1 % of cases respectively (data are not shown).
However, they should be systematically collected to complement current surveillance data focusing on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study conducted in 2010-11 showed a wide variation in the availability of intensive care and intermediate care beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 inhabitants in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds of intensive care and intermediate care per 100,000 inhabitants in 2010–11).
Model scenarios in relation to the saturation of the medical care capacity, with calculations for each EU/EEA country and the UK of the prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalization cases associated with a risk >90 % of overcoming the capacity of intensive care beds, are provided in the sixth update of ECDC’s rapid risk assessment on COVID-19.
As cases have so far been clustered in certain regions of the EU/EEA and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units normally serve a defined regional capture population, information on cases and intensive care beds should preferably be made available at the level of the Statistical Territorial Unit Nomenclature 2 (NUTS-2).
Italy's experience and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is moving rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units, therefore, should be prepared for a sustained community transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 and an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 requiring medical care and, in particular, intensive care, such as in the affected regions of Italy.
As indicated in the rapid risk assessment of ECDC, it is essential to adopt a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a change from a containment approach to a mitigation approach, since the rapid increase envisaged in the number of cases may not give sufficient time to decision makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly if not implemented in advance.
The rapid risk assessment also lists the public health measures necessary to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short period of opportunity for countries to deepen their control efforts to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on the health system.
If this is not done, health systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to face a wave of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days and weeks.
The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (SARS-CoV-2), has so far led to the death of 3,000 people and has infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere, resulting in a catastrophe for humans.
Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could also be transmitted from bats and causes similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has lower severity and mortality than SARS, but it is much more communicable and affects older people than young people and more men than women.
In response to the growing number of publications on the emerging disease, the purpose of this article is to provide a timely and comprehensive analysis of the research topic, which is developed rapidly.
We will address the basic aspects of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and disease prevention.
Although many questions remain unanswered, we hope that this analysis will help to understand and eradicate this threatening disease.
The Spring Festival of 25 January 2020 has become an unforgettable and memorable memory for all Chinese people, who were urged to stay at home throughout the festival and for several weeks more due to the outbreak of a new viral disease.
The virus has almost the same name as the coronavirus (CoV) that caused a outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, on February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) called it SARS-CoV-2, and the associated disease was called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China and spread rapidly throughout the country and to almost 50 more countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus has caused more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients high and more than 3000 patients died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is the "public enemy number 1" and that it is potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 scientific articles have been published on COVID-19, including its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report of 7 January 2020, which determined the sequence of the virus isolated from multiple patients.
The aim of this analysis is to summarize the progress made in research on this new subject that is developing rapidly.
When possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another disease caused by a CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, a outbreak in 2012).
We will also examine what is known so far about the prevention and prognosis of the disease, as well as some key questions that have not yet been answered.
Coronaviruses have traditionally been considered non-lethal pathogens for humans, which mainly cause about 15% of common colds 4.
However, in this century, we have met twice with highly pathogenic coronaviruses in humans, i.e. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which originally caused an outbreak in China, in 2003, and Saudi Arabia, in 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other countries with appalling morbidity and mortality.
Therefore, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is the third coronavirus of which is recorded in the history of mankind.
As shown in fig. Fig. 1.1, conglomerates of pneumonia of unknown origin were first informed on 31 December 2019 of Wuhan to the National Health Commission of China.
Seven days later, the sequence of the coronavirus was revealed.
On 15 January 2020, the first fatal case was registered in Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to cities, provinces and neighbouring countries.
On 20 January, the infection of health care providers was reported, suggesting that transmission between humans was possible.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan was placed in quarantine and all public transport was suspended.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on the disease reported that of the 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 had had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market which was considered the site of origin of the infection of an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, WHO declared a global health emergency to the outbreak.
At the time of this report, the disease has already spread throughout China and almost 50 more countries around the world (fig. 2).
As the situation evolves rapidly, the final dimension and severity of the outbreak cannot yet be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multicenter study of 8866 patients, including 4021 patients with confirmed COVID-19, presented a more up-to-date illustration of the epidemic described below (https://mp.weixin.qqq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but mainly people aged 30 to 65.
Nearly half (47.7%) of infected persons were over 50 years of age, very few were under 20 and only 14 were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/100 000) than women (0.27/100 000).
The COVID-19 expanded mainly in conglomerates in and around Hubei.
On average, 5 days (from 2 to 9) were between the appearance and diagnosis of VOCID-19.
The mean incubation period was 4.8 days (between 3.0 and 7.2).
The average time from onset to death was 9.5 days (between 4.8 and 13).
The basic reproductive number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected persons increased exponentially before January 23, 2020, which coincides with the age of mass mobilization prior to the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and the adjusted mortality of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for VOCID-19 were sex (male), age (≥60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a large and wrapped subfamily of viruses that contain a single-way RNA.
They can be divided into four genera, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alphacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus are those that infect humans.
Spinal glycoprotein (S) of the envelope binds to its cellular receptors, the angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptide 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV respectively, and then membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released to the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA, along with the nucleocapsid envelope glycoproteins and proteins, forms vesicles containing virions, which are then merged with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was announced on 10 January 2020.
It was found that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of betacoronavirus with a genetic identity of more than 99.98 % in 10 sequential samples taken from the original outbreak site: the Huhanan seafood market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
With an electronic transmission microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in ultra thin sections of the human respiratory epithelium.
Human ACE2 was determined to be a receiver of SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds to human ACE2 weaker than SARS-CoV protein, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less serious infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
The SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein encoded by the orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by the orf8.
Orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 may have a function in viral pathogenicity and inhibit IFNβ expression; however, orf8 does not contain any known domain or functional reason.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al., revealed the structure of complete-length ACE2 electronic cryomicroscopy in resolution 2.9 Å, in complex with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They discovered that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was assembled as a dimer, and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can combine two S proteins, which provides evidence for the recognition and infection of the coronavirus.
B0AT1 could become a therapeutic target for drug study in order to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The origin and the intermediate guest
It is known that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated in bats and transmitted to humans through civets and camels, respectively.
In a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, bat is considered to be the native guest of SARS-CoV-2, since the new virus is identical in 96% to two coronavirus similar to bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, it is still unknown which intermediate guest helped the virus cross the species barrier to infect humans, and it remains to delucidate the transmission route.
Ji, et al., proposed snakes as carriers of bat virus to humans, which involved homologous recombination within protein S.
According to one study, researchers from Guangzhou, China, suggested that pangolines (long-leaf mammals that feed on ants and are usually used in traditional Chinese medicine) are a possible intermediate guest of SARS-CoV-2 based on a genetic homology of 99% in a coronary virus discovered in pangolines and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a 1 % difference propagated by the whole of two genomes remains a great difference; therefore, conclusive results are expected to provide concrete evidence (fig. 33).
The physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still widely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at less than 20 °C with a moisture of 40-50 %.
SARS-CoV-2 could have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be sensitive to ultraviolet rays and to heat at 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol at 75%, chlorine disinfectant, perchloric acid, chloroform and other fat solvents, but not chlorhexidine, are effective for disabling the virus.
The entire human population in general lacks immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and, therefore, is susceptible to the new coronavirus.
So far, no detailed study has been announced on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only use previous studies with other coronaviruses, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (fig. (fig. 4).
In general, after the virus invades the host, it is first recognized by the host's innate immune system through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including type C lectin receptors, toll-type receptors (TLRs), NOD-type receptors (NLRs) and RIG-I (RLRs).
Through different pathways, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFN) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophageal phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, SARS-CoV N protein can help the virus escape immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response adds to the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8+ T cells directly kill virus-infected cells.
Co-operative T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to help defence cells.
However, coronaviruses may inhibit T cell functions by inducing T cell apoptosis.
Humoral immunity, which includes supplements such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, is also essential to combat viral infection.
For example, the isolated antibodies of a recovered patient neutralized the MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an exaggerated response of the immune system locally generates a large number of free radicals that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst case, multiorganic failure and even death.
The SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by the appearance in conglomerates, more likely affects older people with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is common for people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised to be more likely to infect than others.
The estimated average of the SARS-CoV-2 incubation period is 1 to 14 days, mostly between 3 and 7 days, according to a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1099 cases shows that the incubation period was on average 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, shows that the incubation period was 4.8 days (between 3.0 and 7.2) based on the demography of 8866 cases.
It is very important that health authorities adapt the effective quarantine time according to the most accurate incubation period; this is how it will be expected that asymptomatic infected people will transmit the virus to others.
As a usual practice, people exposed to the virus or infected should normally remain quarantined for 14 days.
Should quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fever is usually the main and initial symptom of COVID-19, which may be accompanied by no other symptoms or other symptoms such as dry cough, dysnea, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients had dyspnoea or hypoxemia one week after the disease appeared.
In severe cases, patients rapidly evolved to develop acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever or respiratory symptoms and acute fever, even without pulmonary abnormalities in imaging studies, should be tested for early diagnosis.
A demographic study at the end of December 2019 indicated that the percentages of symptoms were 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dysnea and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients required respiratory care.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies of a family conglomerate and a conglomerate caused by the transmission of an asymptomatic person.
Comparably, a 2012 demographic study showed that patients with MERS-CoV also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dysnea (55%) as main symptoms.
However, 80% of them required respiratory assistance, much more than patients with COVID-19 and in line with the highest mortality of MERS with respect to COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and throat pain (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
In patients with SARS, fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dysnea (40%-42%), diarrhoea (20%-25%) and throat pain (13%-25%) were shown to be the main symptoms and respiratory care was required in approximately 14% to 20% of patients.
By 14 February, COVID-19 mortality was 2% when confirmed cases reached 66,576 worldwide.
Similarly, SARS mortality for November 2002 was 10% in 8096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, according to a population study of June 2012, mortality was 37% in 2494 confirmed cases.
In a previous study, it was reported that SARS-CoV-2's R0 was high and stood at 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) from 5.71 to 7.23, while SARS-CoV's R0 ranged from 2 to 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The previous figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater propagation capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but its lethality is lower than that of the latter two.
Therefore, it is much more difficult to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than those of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The appearance in conglomerates usually occurs within the same family or from the same meeting or vehicle, such as a cruise.
Patients usually have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan and other affected areas or contact with infected persons or patients within the two weeks prior to onset.
However, it has been reported that people may carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and that patients discharged from the hospital may resume contracting the virus, an alarm signal that quarantine time should be increased.
Patients have a normal or reduced amount of white blood cells in the peripheral blood (especially lymphocytes) at the early stage.
For example, lymphopenia was observed with a white blood cell count of <4×109/l, including a lymphocyte count of <1×109/l, and high levels of aspartate aminotransferase in 1099 patients with COVID-19.
Liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin levels were elevated in the blood of some patients, and C-reactive protein and erythrocytic sedimentation were elevated in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the level of dimer-D, a product of the degradation of fibrin present in the blood, was high, and lymphocyte count was gradually reduced.
Anomalies are detected in thoracic X-rays in most patients with COVID-19, characterized by bilateral emerilated glass shades or opacity in the lungs.
Patients usually develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory difficulty syndrome (ADRS).
When SDRA is produced, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis seriously affect gas exchange.
Dysfunction of type I and type II pneumocytes decreases the surfactant level and increases the surface tension, thus reducing the capacity of the lungs to expand and increasing the risk of pulmonary collapse.
Consequently, the worst findings in chest X-rays are usually paralleled to the maximum severity of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the release of pneumonia, the formation of a hyaline membrane and the infiltration of lymphocytes into the interstitium, and multiple sincicial cells in the lungs of a patient who died due to the disease, which is consistent with the pathology of a viral infection and SDRA, and similar to that of patients with SARS and MERS.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by a chain reaction of polymerase with reverse transcriptase (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which could accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations for diagnosis (which were no longer based solely on RT-PCR) in China on 13 February 2020 began to be used.
A similar situation also occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological findings is essential and imperative for effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a CRISPR-based use protocol to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic fragments of SARS-CoV-2 RNA between 20 × 10-18 mol/l and 200 × 10-18 mol/l (10-100 copies per microlitre sample) using a graduated rod in less than one hour that does not require complex instruments.
With luck, the new technique can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience if it occurs in clinical samples.
Due to lack of experience with the new coronavirus, physicians can mostly provide support care for patients with COVID-19, while testing with a variety of therapies that have been used or proposed previously for the treatment of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (table 2).
These therapies include treatments currently in use or potential with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma of recovered patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
It was even proposed to use the plasma of recovered patients for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies compete to see who first develops antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 attacks mainly the lungs at the beginning and probably also attacks, to a lesser extent, other organs that express ACE2, such as those of the digestive tract and the kidneys.
However, respiratory dysfunction and insufficiency are the greatest threat to patients and the main cause of death.
Consequently, respiratory assistance is critical to relieve symptoms and save lives, and includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation according to the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need extracorporeal membrane oxygenation assistance (CEMO), a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique that is used to treat potentially fatal heart or respiratory insufficiency.
In addition, the maintenance of electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, and the protection of vital organ functions are also essential in patients with SARS-CoV-2.
Cytokin storm is known to be the result of an exaggerated immune system reaction in patients with SARS and MERS.
Cytocin storm is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a number of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNβ and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a huge amount of free radicals that are the main cause of SDRA and multiorganic failure.
Immunosuppression is essential for the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, a monoclonal IL6 receptor antibody, have been used to treat cytokine storm.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine storms include modulation of T-cell-directed immune response; blockage of IFN-Δ, IL-1 and TNF; inhibition of JAK; blinatumomab; suppressor of cytokine signaling pathway 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, such as immunosuppressants, were widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high-dose steroids were not beneficial for severe lung injuries in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
On the other hand, they can cause serious side effects, specifically osteonecrosis, which significantly affects the prognosis.
However, the prudent use of corticosteroids in low to moderate doses has been recommended over a short period of time for patients with COVID-19 in critical condition.
At the time of this analysis, the effectiveness of any antiviral therapy has not been confirmed.
However, the efficacy of redesivir, a nucleotide analogue, administered intravenously in an American patient with COVID-19, has been verified.
Reddesivir is a new antiviral drug originally developed by Gilead for the treatment of Ebola and Marburg virus diseases.
Subsequently, redesivir also demonstrated the potential for inhibiting other viruses with monocatenal RNA, such as MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on these, Gilead has provided the compound to China to carry out a couple of trials in people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and there is great expectation for the results.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon alfa, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been suggested as possible therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
Interaction of these treatments with other drugs used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma of recovered patients and antibody generation
The blood extraction of patients who recovered from an infectious disease to treat other patients who have contracted the same disease or to protect healthy people so that they do not contract the disease is not something new.
In fact, recovered patients usually have a relatively high level of antibodies against the pathogen in the blood.
The antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by lymphocytes B to fight pathogens and other foreign objects, and recognize certain molecules in the pathogens and neutralize them directly.
On this basis, blood plasma was extracted from a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 and injected into 10 seriously ill patients.
Her symptoms improved within 24 hours, accompanied by reduced inflammation and viral loads and better oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, it is necessary to verify and clarify this to propose the method for large-scale use until specific therapies are developed.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some plasma-associated disadvantages should be considered carefully.
For example, antibodies can overstimulate immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which may result in fatal toxicity.
Blood antibody concentration is usually low, and plasma demand is high to treat patients in critical condition.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to combat a global pandemic.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from recovered patients and identify genetic codes that encode effective antibodies or seek effective antibodies against essential virus proteins.
In this way, we can easily increase the production of antibodies.
MCT has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of diseases in China.
However, its effects depend largely on a combination of several components in a formula that varies according to the diagnosis of a disease according to MCT theories.
Most effective components remain unknown or inaccurate, as it is difficult to extract and verify such components or their optimal combinations.
At present, due to the lack of effective and specific therapy for COVID-19, MCT has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for those who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, it was determined that Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules are effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
The main rates of recovery in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 were observed in several provinces in China that used TCM in 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei province, which used TCM in only about 30% of its patients with COVID-19, had the lowest rate of recovery (13%).
However, this is a fairly approximate comparison, as many other impact factors, such as the amount and severity of patients, should be included in the evaluation.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and his colleagues published a study comparing the treatment of Western Medicine (MO) only with the combined treatment of MO and MCT.
They found that the time required for the recovery of body temperature, the disappearance of symptoms and hospitalization were significantly lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group only.
More surprising, the rate of worsening of symptoms (light to severe) was significantly lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group only (7.4% versus 46.2%) and mortality was lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group only (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the effectiveness and security of the MCT are still waiting for more well-controlled trials on a larger scale and in more centres.
It would also be interesting to characterize the mechanism of actions and to identify the effective components of TCM treatments or their combinations if possible.
Patients with suspicion or confirmation of COVID-19 are generally very afraid of highly contagious and even fatal disease, and quarantine patients also experience boredom, loneliness and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatments, such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, can cause more anxiety and mental distress.
In the early phase of the SARS outbreak, a number of psychiatric disorders were reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitation, psychotic symptoms, delusion and even suicidal tendencies.
The screening of contacts and mandatory quarantine, as part of public health responses to the outbreak of COVID-19, can make people feel more nervous and guilty about the effects of infection, quarantine and stigma on their family and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to patients with COVID-19, suspects and persons in contact with them, as well as to the general public who need it.
Psychological support should include the formation of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communications with regular and accurate updates on the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 and treatment plans and the use of electronic devices and professional applications to avoid close contact with individuals.
Effective vaccines are essential for disrupting the transmission chain of animals and humans infected with susceptible guests, and are often complementary to antiviral treatment in the control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop protein-based S vaccines to generate potent and long-term neutralising antibodies or immunity that protect against SARS-CoV.
Vaccines with live attenuated viruses have been evaluated in animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these possible vaccines in older people and models of lethal stimulation and their protection against zoonotic virus infection should still be determined before a clinical study is initiated.
This is probably due to SARS being extinguished 17 years ago and no new cases have been registered since then.
On the other hand, cases and conglomerates of MERS sporadicly in the Middle East continue to spread to other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccine strategies for MERS have been developed using viruses disabled, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune people is an urgent and decisive task to control the ongoing pandemic.
However, it is difficult to overcome the difficulties due to the long period (18 months on average) necessary for the development of a vaccine and the dynamic variations of the coronaviruses.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has recently begun to manifest its complete clinical course in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover gradually without sequelae.
However, as with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, creating a disease forecast model is essential for health agencies to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on the clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor in the prognosis of SARS, which is also correct for COVID-19.
COVID-19 occurred mostly in people aged 30 to 65 and 47.7% of these patients were over 50 years old in a study of 8866 cases, as described above.
Patients who required intensive care were more likely to have comorbidities and underlying complications and were considerably higher than those who did not require them (mean age 66 versus 51), suggesting that age is a factor in predicting the evolution of patients with COVID-19.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31/100 000 versus 0.27/100 000), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: patients with COVID-19 who require intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute heart injury and arrhythmia.
Heart events were also the main cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 may also join positive ACE2 colangiocytes, which may cause liver dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It should be noted that age and underlying diseases are strongly correlated and may interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: the level of C-reactive protein (CPR) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and has been proposed as a possible factor of prognosis for the disease, response to therapy and final recovery.
In addition, the correlation between the level of PCR and the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 has been proposed.
In addition, a high level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict patient evolution.
These enzymes are intensely expressed in several organs, especially the heart and the liver, and are released when the tissue is damaged.
Therefore, they constitute traditional markers of cardiac or hepatic dysfunction.
Main clinical symptoms: chest X-ray and temporary progression of clinical symptoms should be considered in conjunction with other symptoms for the prediction of clinical outcomes and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants commonly used as adjuvant therapy for infectious diseases in order to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Since high doses of corticosteroids were widespread in patients with severe SARS, many survivors developed avascular osteonecrosis with permanent disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at low doses and for a short period in patients with COVID-19.
Mental stress: as described earlier, during the outbreak of COVID-19, many patients have suffered extraordinary stress, as they generally endured long periods of quarantine and extreme uncertainty, and witnessed the death of close relatives and other patients.
It is essential to provide long-term psychotherapy and support to these patients to help them recover from stress and return to their normal life.
According to demographic studies conducted so far, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics than those of SARS.
In addition to replication in the lower airways, SARS-CoV-2 can be replicated efficiently in the upper airways and causes mild or no symptoms at the early stage of infection, as is the case with other coronaviruses that cause common colds.
Therefore, patients infected at an early stage or during incubation can produce a large amount of viruses during their daily activities, making it extremely difficult to control the epidemic.
However, it was considered that the transmission of SARS-CoV occurred when patients were seriously ill, while the transmission mostly did not occur at the early stage.
Thus, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is much more severe and difficult to control than the outbreak of SARS.
Major efforts are being made at this time in China, including the closure of Wuhan and surrounding cities and the continued quarantine of almost the entire population in hopes of halting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures are causing significant damage to the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing, indicating the slowdown in the epidemic.
According to the most optimistic forecast, the outbreak will have ended by March and the downward phase will last 3 or 4 months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimated that COVID-19, which appears to be significantly more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., created a model to predict the evolution of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two thirds of the world's population.
One Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected as both nasal and pharyngeal exuds in patients who had recovered and had left the hospital two weeks earlier, indicating that the newly identified virus could become a flu-like cyclic episode.
However, promising signs have been seen in China given the decrease in the number of new cases, indicating that current strategies could be working.
Originally it was predicted that Ebola would cause up to one million cases with half a million deaths.
However, through a quarantine and strict isolation, the disease has been controlled.
Like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 may weaken in terms of infection and eventually become a less pathogenic virus coexisting with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS is given below (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmitted through cough or sneezing, and possibly also through direct contact with materials contaminated with the virus.
The virus was also detected in faeces, which raises a new possibility of fecal-oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases had possibly been caused by nosocomyo infections, including 17 patients with other previous diseases and 40 health care providers.
Therefore, precautions should be taken to protect humans, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues and even transients in contact with infected patients or persons.
The first line of defense that could be used to reduce the risk of infection is the use of masks; the use of surgical masks and masks with N95 breather (series number 1860) helps control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent liquid droplets of a potentially infected person from being transmitted through the air or attached to the surfaces, from which they could be transmitted to other people.
However, only N95 masks (series number 1860) can protect against inhalation of virions as small as 10 to 80 nm, and only 5% of virions can penetrate them completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size and both measure about 85 nm.
Since particles may penetrate up to five stacked surgical masks, direct contact medical care providers with patients should use the N95 masks (series number 1860) and not the surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health care providers should use tailor-made isolation thresholds in order to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing an N95 mask; it is possible that the virus entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, health care providers should also wear protective blankets or transparent glasses while working with patients.
For the general public of affected or potentially affected areas, it is strongly suggested that the population wash their hands with disinfectant soaps more closely followed by the usual, try to stay at home on voluntary quarantine and limit contact with people who may be infected.
Three feet is considered to be an appropriate distance for people to stay away from a patient.
These measures are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 appeared as a new virus for the human world, its high homology with SARS-CoV, reported January 7, 2020, should have caused great alert in China for its experience with SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, it was only until 19 January 2020 that the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control reassured the citizens by saying that the new virus had low contagiousness and limited reproductive capacity among humans, and that there would be no problem in preventing and containing the disease.
This message significantly relaxed the public's alarm, especially at a time when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical moment to contain the disease on a minimum scale in Wuhan was neglected.
Chinese disease control agencies should learn from this hard lesson and adopt decisive improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should be (1) more cautious when making public announcements, since every word matters to citizens and can make them change their attitude or decisions; (2) more sensitive and responsive to unusual information from clinics, rather than waiting for formal reports from doctors or officials; (3) more restrictive to contain a possible epidemic at its early stage, rather than trying to reassure the public; and (4) more regular in the implementation of adapted and effective simulations to increase public awareness of epidemic diseases and to test and improve society's response system periodically.
The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread throughout China and some 50 more countries around the world at the time of this analysis.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and there are also many similarities between the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS, the outbreak of COVID-19 has generated the sensation of SARS reappearing.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential to contain the epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and more men than women, and gravity and mortality are also greater in older people than in young people.
SARS has higher mortality than COVID-19 (10.91 % versus 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 transmit the virus although they do not have symptoms, while patients with SARS usually do so when they are seriously ill, which generates a much greater difficulty in containing the spread of COVID-19 compared to SARS.
This explains, in part, why SARS-CoV-2 spread much faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
The regular RNA test for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, cured patients can give positive in the virus again.
These results dramatically increase the risk of spread of the virus.
Given the rapid progress in COVID-19 research, a number of important issues such as:
Where did the SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% of genetic homology was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two coronaviruses of bats similar to SARS, it is still not possible to conclude that SARS-CoV-2 comes from bats.
Which animal was the intermediate species that transmitted the original guest virus, say, bats, to humans?
Without knowing the responses to number 1 and 2, it is not possible to stop transmission efficiently, and the outbreak can resuscitation at any time.
Although molecular modelling and biochemical testing have shown that SARS-CoV-2 joins ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter the respiratory tract cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also join the cells that express ACE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is not possible to achieve a rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically while transmitted among humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, will it extinguish like SARS or will it periodically rise as the flu?
While it may take some time, it is essential to seek answers to these and many other questions.
However, whatever it takes, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to our normal life.
Zoonotic Origins of Human Coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have driven the co-evolution of the coronaviruses and their guests, including human beings, for thousands of years.
Until 2003, it was known that two human coronaviruses caused mild diseases, such as common cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have reversed the currency by revealing how devastating and deadly a human coronavirus infection can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019 put the coronaviruses in the attention centre again and surprised us with high transmissibility and reduced pathogenicity compared to their brother, SARS-CoV.
Human coronavirus infection is a zoonosis and it would be useful to know the zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses.
Most human coronaviruses have their origin in bats, in which they are not pathogens.
Guests of intermediate reservoirs of some human coronavirus are also known.
Identifying animal guests has direct implications for the prevention of diseases in humans.
Investigating interactions between coronavirus and guests in animals could also provide important information on the pathogenesis of coronaviruses in humans.
In this analysis, we present a general description of the existing knowledge of the seven human coronaviruses, with emphasis on the history of their discovery, as well as their zoonotic origins and transmission among species.
Notably, we compare and contrast the different human coronaviruses from the perspective of the evolution of the virus and the recombination of the genome.
The current epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is analysed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for successful guest changes and the implications of the evolution of the virus in the severity of the disease are also highlighted.
Coronaviruses belong to the Coronaviridae family, which includes a group of positive monochatenary RNA viruses with envelope.
These viruses, which house the largest genome, from 26 to 32 kilobases, among the RNA viruses, were called "coronavirus" due to their morphology, by the form of a crown that they have under an electronic microscope.
As for its structure, coronaviruses have unsegregated genomes that share a similar organization.
Approximately two thirds of the genome contain two large open reading frameworks (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into repplicable polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab.
Polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 non-structural proteins, called nsp1~16.
The remaining part of the genome contains ORF for structural proteins, including spike (S), wrap (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
A series of ancillary proteins specific to each lineage are also encoded by different coronavirus lineages.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, coronaviruses are classified into four genera (alphacoronavirus, betacoronavirus, gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus), among which the genus betacoronavirus contains most of the human coronaviruses and is subdivided into four lineages (A, B, C and D).
The phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents are the source of genes in most alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus, while birds are the main reservoir of gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus.
For thousands of years, coronaviruses have constantly crossed the boundaries of species and some have emerged as important human pathogens.
To date, seven human coronaviruses are known.
Among them, HCOV-229E and HCOV-NL63 are alphacoronavirus.
The other five betacoronavirus are HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronary artery (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronary artery (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as common cold or diarrhoea.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the recently identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic and cause severe infection of the lower respiratory tract in a relatively larger number of patients, with a higher probability of developing acute respiratory difficulty syndrome (RASD) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first strain of HCOV-229E, B814, was isolated from nasal secretion of patients with common cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been accumulated through comprehensive studies on HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43, which cause self-limited symptoms.
In fact, until the outbreak of SARS, it was a widely accepted concept that human coronavirus infection is generally harmless.
The SARS outbreak that occurred in 2003 is one of the most devastating in today's history and has infected more than 8,000 people, with a crude mortality of about 10%.
Ten years later, the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) resulted in a persistent epidemic on the Arabian peninsula with sporadic spread to the rest of the world.
The new human coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), later known as SARS-CoV-2, is the cause agent of the ongoing 2019 coronavirus disease epidemic (COVID-19), which has claimed more than 3120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm has been ringing and the world must prepare for the approaching SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
The seven human coronaviruses have a zoonotic origin in bats, mice or domestic animals.
Several lines of evidence support the evolutionary origin of all human coronaviruses in bats, in which viruses are well adapted and are not pathogens, but present great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has posed enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges in China and the rest of the world.
Tracking the zoonotic origins of human coronavirus provides a framework for understanding natural history, driving force and the factors of restriction of the gap between species.
This could also guide or facilitate the search for the reservoir and intermediate animal guests and amplifiers of SARS-CoV-2, which would have important implications for the prevention of future propagation.
In this analysis, we present a general description of the zoonotic origins, the transmission between species and the pathogen of human coronaviruses.
In particular, we highlight and analyze the common theme that the parental viruses of human coronaviruses are normally not pathogens in their natural reserve guests, but become pathogens after transmission between species to a new host.
We also examine the evolution of human coronaviruses, in which increased transmissibility usually leads to reduced pathogenicity.
The evolution of the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is also analysed in this context.
Animal coronaviruses have been known since the late 1930s.
Before strain B814 of HCOV-229E was first isolated from nasal secretion of patients who had contracted a common cold, different coronaviruses had been isolated in different infected animals, such as turkey, mouse, cow, pig, cat and dog.
In recent decades, seven human coronaviruses have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of the discoveries of human coronaviruses in chronological order (Table 1) would be informative and instructive.
The first strain of HCOV-229E was isolated from the respiratory pathways of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966 and subsequently adapted to grow in cell lines WI-38 of the lung.
Patients infected with HCOV-229E had symptoms of common cold, such as headache, sneezing, general discomfort and throat pain, with fever and cough in 10~20% of cases.
Later, in 1967, HCOV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and the subsequent serial passage into the brains of lactating mice.
The clinical characteristics of HCOV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to those caused by HCOV-229E, whose symptoms are identical to those of infections by other respiratory pathogens such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
Both HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43 are distributed worldwide and tend to broadcast predominantly during the winter season, in temperate climates.
Generally, the incubation time of these two viruses is less than a week, followed by a period of disease of about 2 weeks.
According to a study with human volunteers, healthy people infected with HCOV-229E developed a mild common cold.
Only some immunocompromised patients had severe lower respiratory tract infection.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", caused the first pandemic caused by a well documented human coronavirus in the history of humanity, and the etiologic agent is SARS-CoV, the third human coronavirus that was discovered.
The first case of SARS dates back to the end of 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8096 reported cases of 774 deaths and spread across many countries and continents.
Apart from the superpropagators, it was estimated that each case could cause approximately two secondary cases, with an incubation period of 4-7 days and the occurrence of the maximum viral load on the tenth day of disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially have myalgia, headache, fever, general discomfort and chills, followed by dysnea, cough and respiratory difficulty as late symptoms.
Lymphopenia, impaired liver function and high creatine kinase levels are common abnormal results in SARS laboratory tests.
Diffuse alveolar damage, proliferation of epithelial cells and an increase in macrophages are also observed in patients with SARS.
Approximately 20-30% of patients subsequently require intensive care and mechanical respiratory care.
In addition to the lower airways, several organs, including the gastrointestinal tube, liver and kidney, may also be infected in these severe cases, usually accompanied by a cytokine storm, which may be fatal, particularly in immunodepressed patients.
The virus was first isolated from the open-air lung biopsy of a relative of the initial patient who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, huge efforts have been made to investigate human coronaviruses.
HCOV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
Initially, it was found to be prevalent in young children, older adults and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
The presentation of corriza, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis is common in the disease caused by HCOV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from a nasal sample taken from an 8-month-old child suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although identified in the Netherlands, it is actually distributed around the world.
It has been estimated that HCOV-NL63 causes approximately 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, and their maximum incidence occurs early in summer, spring and winter.
HCOV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as crup.
In the same year, HCOV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCOV-HKU1 was reported to be associated with acute asthma exacerbations.
Like HCOV-NL63, HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 was worldwide and caused mild respiratory diseases.
These four human coronary virus acquired in the community have adapted well to humans and, in general, are less likely to mutate to cause highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents have occurred due to unknown causes, such as in the rare case of a more virulent HCOV-NL63 subtype, which has recently been reported to have caused serious infection of the lower airways in China.
In general, when these human coronaviruses acquire the ability to transmit efficiently and continuously maintain themselves in humans, they also become less virulent or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lung of a 60-year-old patient who had developed acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most of the cases confirmed in the laboratory are from the Middle East, occasionally imported cases have occurred to close contacts in several European and Tunisia countries.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SARS, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also developed acute renal failure, which so far only occurs with MERS among diseases caused by human coronavirus.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As at 14 February 2020, more than 2500 confirmed cases were recorded in the laboratory, with a high lethality of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses for humans known to one another.
From mid to late December 2019, conglomerates of patients with pneumonia were detected in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, which were retrospectively associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The World Health Organization declared the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 an emergency of public health of international importance and also called COVID-19 disease.
As at 3 March 2020, 90,053 cases worldwide have been confirmed, with a raw death rate of 3,4%.
Notably, mortality in Hubei, China, is 4.2%, while off it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infection, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which occurs as fever, cough and dysnea.
Diarrhea has also been observed in some patients.
Pulmony is one of the most severe symptoms and can rapidly evolve into acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to 82% high nucleotide sequence homology, they are categorized into different branches of the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but more communicable compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Cases of asymptomatic people infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, which could contribute to their rapid spread worldwide.
Comparing and contrasting SARS-CoV-2 with the other six human coronaviruses, similarities and differences of great interest are identified.
First, the incubation period and duration of the course of human coronary artery disease are very similar.
In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six human coronaviruses.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms lies between SARS-CoV and the four human coronavirus acquired in the community (i.e. HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection has characteristics that are most frequently observed in community-acquired coronary virus infections, including the presentation of non-specific or mild symptoms or even the absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, there is also a small subgroup of severe cases of COVID-19 as is the case with SARS-CoV infection, although the relationship is slightly smaller.
Third, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns characteristic of both the coronary virus acquired in the community and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of humans acquired in the community.
On the other hand, it remains to be verified whether the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after passes between humans, as is the case with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, as with other human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in faecal samples.
If the faecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role, as in the case of SARS-CoV, at least in some circumstances, it must still be clarified in future studies.
It is also of particular interest to find out if SARS-CoV-2 could exhibit seasonality, as is the case with the coronary virus of humans acquired in the community.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable propagation after passing between humans, will influence the final outcome of the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19.
The four human coronaviruses acquired in the community that cause mild symptoms have adapted well to humans.
From another perspective, it might also be true that humans have adapted well to these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, both could be survivors of ancient human coronary artery pandemics.
Coronaviruses have been eliminated from humans that cause serious diseases in humans and humans that have developed serious coronary syndromes in humans.
For this to happen, human coronaviruses must be replicated in humans to a sufficient extent to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that counter the host's restriction factors.
In this sense, the longer the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 and the more infected people, the greater the probability that it will be fully adapted to humans.
If properly adapted, its transmission in humans would be difficult to stop through quarantine or other infection control measures.
For many years, the four coronaviruses acquired in the community have circulated in human populations and have caused common colds in immunocompetent people.
These viruses don't need an animal reservoir.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted well to humans and their transmission between humans is unsustainable.
They need to stay and spread in their zoonotic reservoirs and seek the opportunity to spread to susceptible human goals, possibly through one or more intermediate guests and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV as well as the four human coronaviruses acquired in the community.
It is highly communicable as the coronaviruses of humans acquired in the community, at least for the time being.
However, it is more pathogenic than acquired human coronaviruses in the community and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will be fully adapted to humans and circulate among humans without an animal reserve or intermediate guest.
Before analyzing the animal origins of human coronaviruses, we will be useful to examine the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate and human coronavirus amplifiers.
An animal acts as an evolutionary guest of a human coronavirus if it houses a closely related ancestor who shares a high homology at the nucleotide sequence.
The ancestral virus is usually well adapted and is not pathogen in this guest.
Similarly, a reserve guest houses a human coronavirus continuously and in the long term.
In both cases, guests are naturally infected and are the natural guests of the human coronavirus or their parental virus.
On the other hand, if the human coronavirus was introduced into the intermediate guest just before or almost at the same time as its introduction into humans, it is not well adapted to the new host and is usually pathogenous.
The intermediate guest can act as the zoonotic source of human infection and perform the amplifying host function by allowing the virus to replicate transiently and then transmit to humans to amplify the scale of the infection in humans.
A human coronavirus may cause infection in the terminal guest if it cannot sustain transmission in the intermediate guest.
On the contrary, human coronaviruses can also adapt to the intermediate guest and even generate long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate guest becomes a natural reserve guest.
The epidemiological data retrospectively revealed that the initial case of SARS had been in contact with hunting animals.
Further studies on seroprevalence indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence of IgG anti-SARS-CoV compared to that of the general population.
Civetes of masked palms (Paguma larvata) and a raccoon dog in live animal markets were the first identified carriers of viruses similar to SARS-CoV that are almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no more SARS cases were recorded after killing all civets in the markets.
However, it was reported that the civets of wild masked palms or farms without exposure to live animals markets were mostly negative in SARS-CoV, suggesting that the civets of masked palms would only act as an amplifying intermediate guest, but not as a natural reserve of SARS-CoV.
Notably, since 80% of the different animals in Guangzhou markets have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the potential for several species of small mammals to also act as intermediate SARS-CoV amplifiers cannot be ruled out.
They all seem to be terminal guests of SARS-CoV.
Later searches of SARS-CoV's natural animal host revealed a closely related coronavirus of bats, known as CoV HKU3 of Rhinolophus bats related to SARS (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in Chinese ferratus bats.
These bats are positive in anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genome sequence.
This and other bat coronavirus share a nucleotide sequence homology of 88-92% with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation for the new concept that bats host emerging pathogens in humans.
Several SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoV) have also been identified in bats, but none, except one called WIV1, can be isolated as live viruses.
It is known that the angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ACE2) human is the receptor of SARS-CoV.
It was shown that the WIV1 obtained from a fecal sample of bats uses ACE2 of bats, civets and humans as a receptor to enter the cells.
Amazingly, serums of patients with convalescent SARS were able to neutralize WIV1.
So far, the WIV1 represents the most closely related ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, which shares a 95% nucleotide sequence homology.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parental virus of SARS-CoV and that bats are not the immediate reserve host of SARS-CoV.
According to the phylogenetic analysis, the MERS-CoV is categorized into the same group as the bat's CoV-HKU4 and bat's CoV-HKU5.
The bat's CoV-HKU4 and the MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, dipeptidyl peptide 4 (DPP4), for virus entry.
MERS-CoV-dependent polymerase RNA sequences phylogenetically draw closer to their beta coronavirus counterparts of bats identified in Europe and Africa.
So far, you can't find a MERS-CoV living in wild bats.
The MERS-CoV and its closest relative, the bat's CoV-HKU25, share a nucleotide sequence homology of only 87 %.
Therefore, the bat might not be the Mers-CoV's immediate reserve guest.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromedars are seropositive in neutralizing antibodies of the MERS-CoV specifically, as do camels originating in the Middle East in several African countries.
A living MERS-CoV identical to the virus found in humans was isolated from the exuded dromedary nasal, which further supports that camels act as hosts of bona fide reservoir of the MERS-CoV.
It should also be noted that mild symptoms have generally been observed, but a massive spread of the virus into infected camels for research with MERS-CoV.
Notably, infected camels propagate viruses not only by respiratory, but also by faecal-oral, which is also the main way of spreading bat viruses.
However, there are still questions, as many confirmed cases of MERS do not have a history of contact with camels prior to symptoms, which is reasonably attributed to transmission between humans or unknown transmission pathways involving unrecognized animal species hosting the MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares a 96.2% nucleotide homology with a bat coronavirus, RaTG13, isolate from Rhinolophus finis bats.
As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to assign a parental relationship.
In other words, bats may not be the immediate reserve guests of SARS-CoV-2 unless they are found in the future coronavirus of virtually identical bats.
Presumably, the intermediate animal guests of SARS-CoV-2 should be among the wild species that are sold and killed in the wholesale market of Huanan shellfish, with which many of the initial cases of COVID-19 were associated, indicating a likely event of animal transmission to humans.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have suggested that a group of small mammals in danger, known as pangolines (Manis javanica), could also host ancestral betacoronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2.
The genomes of this new pangoline coronavirus share a 85-92 % nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are equally closely related to RaTG13, with an identity of around 90% at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
They are grouped into two strains of viruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a domain of binding to the receptor (RBD) more similar to SARS-CoV-2, with an amino acid sequence identity of 97.4%.
In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 RBD and RaTG13 are more divergent, despite a higher degree of sequence homology throughout the genome.
A previous study in sick pangolines also reported the detection of viral contagions in lung samples, which are also related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted different methods of assemblage and manual healing to generate a partial genome sequence comprising about 86.3% of the full-length viral genome.
We cannot rule out the possibility that the pangolin is one of the intermediate animal guests of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support direct origin in the SARS-CoV-2 pangolin due to the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and betacoronavirus of pangolines related to SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even smaller than that between SARS-CoV-2 and betacoronavirus of pangolines related to SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutionary route of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolines and other mammals still needs to be established.
Although the highest sequence homology was found in RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, betacoronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest complete genome sequence homology.
It is highly speculative that the high degree of similarity between the RBDs of the betacoronavirus of pangolines related to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 is due to the convergent evolution mediated by selectivity.
A counter-proposal defends a recombination between betacoronavirus of pangolines related to SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 in the third species of wild animal.
As a driving force in evolution, recombination is extended among betacoronavirus.
No conclusion has yet been reached on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, the zoonotic origin of HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-HKU1 was also studied.
The phylogenetic evidence indicated that both HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-229E could have originated from bat coronavirus, while HCOV-OC43 and HCOV-HKU1 parental viruses have been found in rodents.
It was reported that a bat coronavirus called ARCoV.2 (palaches mountain coronavirus) detected in a tricolor bat in North America had a close relationship with HCOV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCOV-229E was genetically related to another bat coronavirus, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, although it has also been suspected of camelides as intermediate guests.
For further clarity, the knowledge of the animal origins of known human coronaviruses is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
The phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence of events of transmission of human coronavirus among species in history.
When HCOV-OC43 crossed between species to infect humans from livestock animals in 1890, a pandemic of respiratory infection was recorded.
The history of transmission between HCOV-229E species is not known with such precision.
The alphacoronavirus of bats closely related to HCOV-229E have been found.
Among them is an alphacoronavirus of alpacas.
Several lines of evidence support the transmission of bat virus directly to humans.
First, unlike the alpacas, humans could have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
Humans, on the other hand, have close contact with the alpacas.
Second, the alphacoronavirus of bats related to HCOV-229E are diverse and non-pathogenous in bats, while alphacoronavirus of alpacas caused an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alphacoronavirus of alpacas has not been found in wild animals.
Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that alpacas acquire human HCOV-229E-related alphacoronavirus.
In fact, bats are the direct source of pathogenic viruses in humans, such as rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it would not be too surprising for bats to transmit HCOV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, while bat alphacoronavirus acts as a genetic acquis of HCOV-229E, alpacas and dromers could act as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, in particular in the case of MERS-CoV.
The MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of transmission between species, from bats to dromedarias, and from dromedarias to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV in bats is discovered with its initial identification, and has also been supported by subsequent findings.
It is clear that bats contribute, with a profuse collection of virus species, to the exchange of genetic fragments between species and to the transmission between species.
Longevity, densely populated colonies, close social interaction and the great ability to fly are all favorable conditions that make bats the ideal "virus propagator".
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has been introduced into the dromedary for decades.
It is well suited to these camels, who have become an intermediate guest, to be a stable and natural reserve guest.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
Their sporadic transmission to humans is an accident and humans remain a terminal guest of the MERS-CoV, as transmission is unsustainable.
In comparison with the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolines, if any, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is different.
In particular, pangolines betacoronavirus are highly pathogenic in pangolines.
They may be a terminal guest of betacoronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2, as are the civets in the case of SARS-CoV.
Several possibilities for transmission between SARS-CoV-2 species of animals to humans, should be confirmed or discarded in future studies.
First, bats could be the reserve guest of a SARS-CoV-2-related virus, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share the ecological niche with bats, through slaughter or coal mining.
Second, pangolines could be one of the intermediate amplifiers in which a virus related to SARS-CoV-2 had recently been introduced.
Humans contract the virus through the slaughter and consumption of hunting meat.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
A study of antibodies is required in domestic and wild animals.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in a third species that has contact with both bats and pangolines.
The search for the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 continues.
Apart from the different types of animal guests, three main factors in viral terms also fulfil an important role in facilitating coronavirus crossing the barriers of species.
First, their relatively high mutation rates in the replication of RNA.
Compared with other monocatenal RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rates of the coronavirus could be considered "moderate" to "high", with an average replacement rate of ~10-4 substitutions per year, per site 2, depending on the adaptation phase of the coronavirus to new guests.
Coronaviruses have a read-check exorribonuklease, whose elimination results in extremely high mutability and attenuation, or even impermissibility.
Interestingly, it is known that the nucleotide analogue redesivir suppresses the replication of the coronavirus by inhibiting this exorribonuclease and the polymerase RNA dependent on RNA.
Redesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents that have been tested in clinical trials.
However, the mutation rates of the coronaviruses are close to one million times higher than those of their guests.
In addition, the mutation rate is usually high when the coronaviruses are not well adapted to the host.
Compared with SARS-CoV, which has a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently lower, suggesting a higher level of human adaptation.
It is to be hoped that it has already adapted to another guest close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to dromedarias.
In theory, genetic drifting is unlikely to cause vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 to lose their effectiveness rapidly.
Second, the long RNA genome of the coronaviruses exercises additional plasticity in the modification of the genome for mutations and recombination and thus increases the probability of co-evolution between species, thus enabling the emergence of new coronaviruses when appropriate conditions are given.
This is supported by the unique copious open reading frameworks and the functions of the proteins encoded towards the 3' direction of the genome.
Third, coronaviruses change randomly and frequently of templates during RNA replication through a unique mechanism of "copy-choice".
In a guest acting as a mixing vehicle, the chain change occurs frequently during the transcription of RNA of the coronavirus.
Full-length RNA and highly homologous subgenomics could be recombined to generate new coronavirus.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-OC43, as well as in animal coronary artery, such as bat's SL-CoV and bat's CoV-HKU9.
Virus-guest interaction in relation to transmission
In addition to the three above-mentioned viral factors, viral interaction with the host receptor is another key factor that influences the transmission between species.
In the present, the recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example, which also showed evidence of positive selection in species transmission events.
Based on the comparative analysis of isolated strains of SARS-CoV of humans and civetas, it is believed that SARS-CoV experiences rapid adaptation in different guests, in particular with mutations in the RBD of protein S.
In general, the S-protein RBD of a coronavirus interacts with the cell receptor and is strongly selected by the host's antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is found in amino acids 318 to 510 in fragment S1, which binds to human ACE2 and its correctors for viral entry.
SARS-CoV RBD is able to recognize ACE2 receptors from several animals, including bats, civets, mice and bats, allowing transmission between virus species.
In fact, it was observed that only 6 amino acid residues were different from the isolated strains of human and civet viruses in the RBD and 4 of them are found in the reason for binding the receptor for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
The Civeta SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which could increase the affinity of the interaction of the strain protein with the ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two substitutions of amino acids could be essential for the adaptation of the virus to humans.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor with SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S1 protein unit implies that the affinity of binding of S protein with human ACE2 could have changed.
In fact, an electronic cryomicroscopy study indicates the affinity 10 to 20 times greater of this union compared to that of human ACE2 and the S protein of SARS-CoV.
It will also be of interest to determine whether any other corrector might be necessary for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Surprisingly, HCOV-NL63 also joins ACE2, but with a different part of S.
There are many other human coronavirus receptors, such as aminopeptidease N in HCOV-229E and 9-O-acetylated syálic acid in HCOV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses in humans, after transmission between species from their animal guests.
In addition to cellular receptors, the result of transmission among species of human coronaviruses is also determined by other factors of dependency and restriction of the host.
The divergence of these guest proteins between humans and natural reserve guests of human coronaviruses, such as bats, dromers and rodents, could constitute an obstacle to the transmission between species.
Human coronaviruses should usurp the guest's dependency factors and subvert the host's restriction factors to ensure successful inter-species transmission.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of virus-guest interaction still need to be identified and characterized.
An objective investigation of complete genome of guest dependency and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 could be beneficial using advanced CRISPR technology.
New Human Coronavirus Appearance: Let's Start From Zero
The diversity of bat coronavirus provides many opportunities for the emergence of new human coronaviruses.
In this sense, bat coronavirus acts as the genetic collection of human coronaviruses.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also drive the evolution of human coronaviruses and constitute two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein coding genes has the potential to dramatically modify viral phenotypes.
Among the accessory proteins of SARS-CoV, it has been considered that ORF8 is important in the adaptation to humans, as bat viruses related to SARS-CoV have been isolated, but it has been determined that they encode divergent ORF8 proteins.
A elimination of 29 characteristic SARS-CoV nucleotides was found in isolated strains at the beginning of the epidemic in humans.
This elimination divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is believed to be an adaptive mutation that promotes change of guests.
In addition, SARS-CoV has possible history of recombination with alpha and gammacoronavirus lineages, which identified a large number of smaller recombinant regions in the polymerase RNA dependent on RNA.
Recombination locations were also identified in nsp9, most of nsp10 and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the epidemic MERS-CoV suffered recombination events between different lineages, which occurred in drugstores in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other human coronaviruses, in which human coronaviruses are recombinant with other animal coronaviruses in their non-structural genes.
It should also be warned that artificial selection can contribute to unwanted changes in viral genomes, which most likely results in the release of viruses from the selection pressures exerted, for example, by the host's immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of a full-length ORF4 in the prototype strain of HCOV-229E due to the elimination of two nucleotides.
Although an ORF4 could be observed intact in bat and camel viruses related to HCOV-229E, the alphacoronavirus of alpacas has a single nucleotide insertion, causing a change in frame.
Last but not least, the evolution of new human coronaviruses is also driven by the pressure of selection in their reserve guests.
No symptoms were detected or only mild symptoms were detected when mice were infected with coronavirus, indicating mutual adaptation between coronavirus and bats.
The bats appear to be well adapted to anatomical and physiologically coronaviruses.
For example, defects in the activation of the inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology caused by coronary artery viruses.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in bats is suppressed due to the positive regulation of natural killer cells inhibitory receptor NKG2/CD94 and the low level of expression of class I molecules of the major histocompatibility complex.
In addition, the high level of oxygen reactive species (ROS) generated from the high metabolic activity of bats could suppress the replication of the coronavirus and affect the reading check of exorribonuclease, which provides the selection pressure for the generation of highly pathogenic virus strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic coronavirus strains could also evolve by recombination, which would lead to the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for the adaptation to the host.
Therefore, it is no coincidence that three new human coronaviruses have appeared in the last two decades.
Coronaviruses are not pathogens or cause mild symptoms in their reserve guests, such as bats and camels.
They replicate vigorously without causing a strong immune response from the guest.
These include the secrets of why there are asymptomatic carriers and what causes serious cases of human infection.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to the hyperactivation of immune response and to the storm of cytokines, in which the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
On the other hand, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response has dissociated itself from the replication of the coronavirus.
The same strategy to unlink the immune response could have beneficial effects on anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon response is especially strong in bats.
Therefore, administration of type I interferon at least at the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be beneficial.
In addition, activation of NLRP3 inflammation in bats is defective.
According to this reasoning, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammation with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The appearance of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general line leading to the appearance of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Although a beta coronavirus of bats has been found that shares 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, there is also a coronavirus of bats that shares 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although Civetas and other animals on the markets have been determined to host viruses identical to SARS-CoV, immediate intermediate guests of SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.
Betacoronavirus of significantly homologous pangolines were found at SARS-CoV-2, indicating that pangolines could act as one of the intermediate guests or that betacoronavirus of pangolines could bring fragments of genes to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is made by man, either deliberately or by accident.
The coronaviruses have recovered the protagonist due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of coronaviruses in bats and other animals has profoundly changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs of human coronaviruses in human transmission.
Wide evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats and are transmitted to humans through intermediate guests.
Since SARS-CoV infection originated in contact between humans and civetas in the markets, closing the wet markets and killing the civetas in them could have been effective in curbing the SARS epidemic.
Following this same reasoning, pangolines should be withdrawn from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, given the discovery of several beta coronavirus lineages of pangolines closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, if and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolines and other mammals remains to be clarified in future investigations.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has been in the dromedaries for a long time.
These camels are an important transport tool, as well as a main source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the local population.
They are widely distributed throughout the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to sacrifice all camels to control the MERS, as was done in China with wild animal markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To prevent recurrent outbreaks of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels, in combination with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may appear that cause outbreaks.
A variety of zoonotic coronaviruses, are circulating in wild state.
In particular, the coronaviruses of bats with zoonotic potential are very diverse.
There are great possibilities for these zoonotic coronaviruses to evolve and recombine, which would lead to the emergence of new coronaviruses that are more transmissible or more deadly in humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
Based on bad experiences with SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparedness and response plan should be adopted.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until the opportunity to spread is presented.
Although bats have many characteristics that favor the spread of viruses, human contact opportunities with bats and other wild species can be minimized if the population is educated to move away from them.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of the coronaviruses and their natural guests, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of animals to humans and future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonoses is to keep humans away from the ecological niches of the natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.
Several pieces are still missing in the SARS-CoV-2 zoonotic origin puzzle.
First, if bats transmit an ancestral virus of SARS-CoV-2 to pangolines, it will be interesting to analyze in what circumstances bats and pangolines could share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if bats have a more direct role in human transmission, it should be determined how humans come into contact with bats.
Thirdly, if a third mammal acts as the true intermediate guest, it must be clarified how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and pangolines.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, could be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, monitoring and experimental infection should be carried out.
Whether it is a bat, pangolin or other mammal, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its parental viruses that are almost identical will be identified in their natural guests in the future.
Continuous research in this area will dilucidate the evolutionary route of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
The diagnostic criteria for "suspecting cases" and "confirmed cases" of COVID-19 need to be updated
On February 6, 2020, our team published a quick guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of infection by the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), and this guideline included our experience and is a good reference to combating this pandemic worldwide.
However, the disease by coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge gradually increase based on the results of ongoing research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also updated continuously.
In this letter, we responded to a comment on our guideline and provided the most recent diagnostic criteria for "suspecting case" and "confirmed case" according to the latest Guidelines for the Diagnostic and Treatment of COVID-19 (seventh edition) published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) triggered a outbreak, which is now officially known as the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the virus was called coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO classified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick advisory guideline that was posted online at Military Medical Research on February 06, 2020.
He's attracted a lot of attention since it was published.
However, it should be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge gradually increase based on the results of ongoing research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continually updated.
For example, the Guidelines for Diagnostics and Treatment of COVID-19 published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020 have published a total of seven editions and some contexts have changed considerably.
Now, our guideline received a comment from Zhou et al., presented a simple classification proposal based on their clinical experience.
His work added new evidence for our guidance and also constitutes a valuable reference for this pandemic throughout the world.
We support his important work and express our appreciation.
However, your work also needs to be updated according to the latest guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 (seventh version of the trial) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm a suspicious case it is necessary to combine any point of epidemiological background characteristics with two points of clinical manifestations to perform a thorough analysis, or three points of clinical manifestations should be met if there is no clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological background: (1) history of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and the surrounding areas, or other communities in which cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with positive nucleic acid testing); (3) history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms of the city of Wuhan and the surrounding areas, or other communities in which cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (4) history of contact with confirmed groups of cases (≥ 2 cases with fever or respiratory symptoms occurring within 2 weeks in small areas, such as the home, the office, a school class, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever or respiratory symptoms; (2) characteristics in COVID-19 infection images; (3) total white blood cell counts showing normal lymphocyte count, decreased or reduced at the early onset stage.
The diagnosis of a confirmed case should be based on a suspicious case with some pathogen or serological test characteristics as follows: (1) real-time positive polymerase chain test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) complete viral genome sequencing showing high homogeneity to recognised new coronary virus; (3) positive result for specific IgM antibody and specific IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2 in serum; or a change of specific IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2 from negative to positive, or increased titre ≥4 times more in the recovery phase than in the acute phase.
We can see that the real-time polymerase chain reaction test to detect nucleic acid in blood samples or airways was added to the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions.
The detection of blood samples was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and then serological tests were added to the seventh edition.
{NS}
In addition, there is increasing evidence that we should be cautious with asymptomatic and symptomatic atypical patients.
Therefore, the flow diagram of Zhou et al. should be updated, since they classified the person without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The scoring system should also be verified in other clinical studies and practices.
In conclusion, we expect more direct evidence to emerge and we ask readers to send us their comments.

Bangladesh reports five new deaths due to COVID-19, the largest number in one day
Bangladesh confirmed yesterday five new deaths due to COVID-19 in one day.
It's the largest number of deaths in one day due to the virus.
Until yesterday, Bangladesh's Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (EDCR) reported that the number of infected cases registered included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases remaining in their homes.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
In an online briefing, IEDCR's director, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said the victims were four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were over 60 years old, two between 51 and 60 years old and one between 41 and 50 years old.
He also said that two of the victims were from Dha.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news medium, that one of the deceased was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Commission, whom they were attending at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Bangladesh's Minister of Road Transport and Bridges, Obadul Quader, said public transport would be suspended for longer than originally planned until next Saturday.
This suspension of public transport had initially started on 26 March and was scheduled to end on Saturday, 4 April.
Transport of essential products, such as medical supplies, fuel and food, was still permitted.
The first recorded cases of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh occurred on 8 March, were two men returning from Italy and also the woman of one of them.
By March 19, these three had already recovered.
More than a million SARS-CoV-2 infections worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infections exceeded one million worldwide, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52,000 deaths were related to COVID-19, the disease caused by coronavirus.
The milestone took place on the same day that Malaui confirmed his first coronary virus infections and Zambia had his first death related to the coronavirus.
North Korea said on Thursday that it was one of the few countries without coronavirus infections.
Yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases within 24 hours prior to 10:00 a.m., European Central Time (UTC-0800) of 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus were reported, linked to at least 5900 deaths.
CBS News reported, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, that on Wednesday there were more than 1000 deaths in the United States caused by coronavirus infections.
Around the world, countries announced stricter measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the closure of the city until May 1.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin stated that the Russians would continue to receive their wages without going to work until 30 April.
The Parliament of Portugal voted to extend the state of national emergency 15 days; the vote was adopted by 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia extended the curfews in the holy cities La Mecca and Medina throughout the day; previously, the curfew was only maintained between 3:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.
Thailand planned to implement a curfew between 10:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state had extended its order to stay home until May 1.
Supermarkets in Australia lower the limits of toilet paper by transaction
On Sunday and Saturday afternoon, Australian supermarket chains Woolworths and Coles lowered their hygienic paper purchase limits to two and one package per transaction in all supermarkets in the country, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also applied the limit of a package.
These limitations were posted as messages in the boxes and Facebook pages of the chains.
Consumers were reportedly being supplied for fear of COVID-19 if people had to self-insulate themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited purchases of toilet paper for home delivery to one package per order.
These changes were introduced after the previous restriction of four packages per transaction applied by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March respectively.
Coles, in his press release of March 8, reported that, with the application of the restriction of four packages, "many supermarkets still exhaust the product within one hour of delivery," and said that the demand "had no precedents", while ALDI, in a Facebook release on Tuesday, said it was "unexpected".
Sales went up with a "strong increase" last week, according to a Woolworths spokesman.
The Costco supermarket in Canberra also limited the amount to two packages last week.
To further alleviate the shortage, Coles requested larger packages from suppliers and increased the frequency of deliveries, Woolworths ordered additional stocks, while ALDI made stocks available for a special offer on Wednesday planned in advance.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said that retailers are trying to increase stocks, but local city restrictions on truck delivery schedules make it difficult for them to do so.
It foresees an increase in production costs, as suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer offers.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that, following the early release of stocks, some supermarkets cannot make the special offer of Wednesday.
In a report at News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at the University of Technology in Queensland, said supermarkets supply stocks every night.
He stressed that the hygienic paper is a voluminous article, which causes a low amount of stocks in numbers, and, when it is exhausted, leaves a wide space empty in the shelves, which intensifies the feeling of scarcity.
Coles and Woolworths have the idea of [that] if there was an abundant amount of the article in the shelves, if products like rolls of toilet paper and disinfectants could [buy] and there would probably be large amounts, panic would be minimized, said Russell Zimmerman by ABC News.
The manufacturer of recycled toilet paper Who Gives a Crap said last Wednesday that the stocks were exhausted.
Kimberly-Clark, who manufactures the toilet paper Kleinex, and Solaris Paper, who manufactures Sorbent, noted that they were working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to maintain the supply, according to the report at News.com.au.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that some property sellers offered free toilet paper to the first bidder at auctions in Melbourne, when fewer auctions were made because buyers had free time on the weekend long the Working Day.
The edition of the Thursday of NT News, a newspaper printed in Darwin, included an eight-page pack designed to be cut and used as a toilet paper.
The supermarkets at the outset were reluctant to impose restrictions, according to an ABC Australia report of 3 March, in which they said they had no plans to introduce restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products also have a lot of demand, including masks, disinfectant, dry products, liquid soap and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, on Sunday afternoon it was observed that the British online store Ocado limited the purchases of the toilet paper Andres to two packs of 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization declares the COVID-19 pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the current outbreak of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
Although the word "pandemia" refers only to the extent of the spread of a disease, not to how dangerous specific cases are, WHO stressed the need to encourage Governments to take action:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries detect, test, treat, isolate, identify and mobilize their inhabitants in the response, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreysus, Director General of WHO.
We are very concerned, both about the alarming levels of spread and gravity and about the alarming levels of inaction.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States, the pandemic "has no precedents".
In statements published by CNN in February, he stated, "in addition to the influenza, no other respiratory virus has been traced from the appearance to the continued global spread."
Gebreysus expressed a similar opinion, and said "we've never seen a pandemic caused by a coronavirus before."
"And we've never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time," he added.
The new pandemic status emerges following the WHO decision in January to declare the outbreak an emergency of public health of international importance.
The director of the U.S. National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said about the outbreak, "in conclusion, it's going to get worse."
Until Thursday, Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, and more than 4600 deaths.
The 2019–20 Coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of 2019 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, as a public health emergency of international importance on 30 January 2020, and was recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As at 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 cases were reported in 210 countries and territories, and about 97,000 deaths were reported as a result.
About 364,000 people recovered.
The case fatality rate was estimated to be 4 per cent in China, while worldwide it was estimated to be between 13.04 per cent in Algeria and 0.08 per cent in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and lack of air.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but may vary from two to fourteen days.
There is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment.
The primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include washing your hands, covering your mouth when coughing, keeping away other people and controlling and self-insulation of people who suspect they are infected.
The authorities around the world responded through the implementation of travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace hazard controls and closures.
The pandemic caused a serious global socio-economic alteration, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and the widespread shortage of supplies aggravated by panic-driven purchases.
Schools and universities closed at national or local level in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of the world's student population.
Misinformation was disseminated on the virus over the Internet, and there were incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, other people of Eastern and South-East Asian descent and appearance, and other areas with significant virus cases.
Due to reduced travel and closures of the heavy industry, there was a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
On 31 December 2019, the health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei province) reported a group of cases of unknown cause pneumonia, and an investigation was initiated in early January 2020.
The cases, mostly, were related to the wholesale market for Huanan seafood, so it was thought that the virus had a zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus closely related to bat coronaviruses, pangoline coronaviruses and SARS-CoV. Subsequently, it was discovered that the first person who was known to exhibit symptoms was ill on December 1, 2019, and that person had no visible connections with the last group of the wet market.
Of the first group of cases reported in December 2019, it was found that two thirds had a link with the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post suggested that a case dating back to 17 November 2019 of a 55-year-old person from Hubei Province could have been the first. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that, as new cases reportedly decreased in China but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had for the first time exceeded the number of new cases within China.
There may be a considerable amount of uninformed cases, especially among those with lighter symptoms.
As at 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported in young people, and those aged 19 and under accounted for 2.4 per cent of cases worldwide. Patrick Vallance, the UK's main scientific adviser, estimated that 60% of the British population would have to be infected before effective collective immunity could be achieved.
The cases refer to the number of persons tested for COVID-19 and obtained a positive result confirmed under the official protocols.
As at 23 March, no country had conducted tests in more than 3% of its population, and many countries had official policies not to carry out tests in people with only mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March revealed that, until 23 January, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections had not been detected in China, and that these unregistered infections were the source of infection of 79% of registered cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy was significantly higher than the reported cases.
Initial estimates of the basic reproductive number (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention determined that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not, the time elapsed from the development of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, being the most frequent 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths had been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as at 5 February, about 80 per cent of deaths were for people over 60 years of age, and 75% had pre-existing diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Official records of deaths by the COVID-19 pandemic, generally refer to deceased persons who gave positive in the COVID test, according to official protocols.
It is possible that the number of actual deaths due to COVID-19 may be much greater, since people who died without having been tested, for example, in their homes, in elderly homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy revealed that the amount of additional deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID death register in a factor of 4 to 5 times.
A spokesperson for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted "We know that [the number of deaths declared] is an underestimation", a statement corroborated by the anecdotal sub-content reports in the United States. This underestimation is frequent in the pandemics, as in the H1N1 swine flu pandemic in 2009. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on 14 February.
On 28 February, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths were recorded in each of the countries of Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As at 13 March, more than forty countries and territories reported deaths on all continents except Antarctica. Several indicators are generally used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary according to the region and over time, and are influenced by the number of tests, the quality of the health system, treatment options, the time elapsed from the initial outbreak and the characteristics of the population, such as age, sex and general health. The proportion of deaths on cases reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a given time interval.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death rate on cases is 6.0% (97 039/1 617 204) as at 10 April 2020.
The number varies according to the region.
In China, estimates of the proportion of deaths on cases decreased from 17.3% (in those with symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (in those with symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other indicators include the mortality rate per case, reflecting the percentage of people diagnosed who died due to a disease, and the rate of mortality due to infections, which reflects the percentage of infected (diagnosised and undiagnosed) who died due to a disease.
These statistics do not have a time limit and consider a specific population from infection to case resolution.
Some academics have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine of Oxford University estimates that the mortality rate for pandemic infections as a whole is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The higher estimate of this range is consistent with the results of the first random tests for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study that analyzed the impact of the tests on the estimates of the case fatality rate.
WHO claims that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and final duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may differ depending on location.
Maciej Boni from the State University of Pennsylvania said, "Infectious outbreaks, if not controlled, generally stabilize and then begin to decrease when the disease is left without guests available.
But, at this point, it is almost impossible to make any reasonable forecast of when that will happen."
China's leading medical adviser, Zhong Nanshan, said that it could "end in June" if all countries could be mobilized to follow WHO's recommendation on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in London said that SARS-CoV-2 "will be circulating, possibly for one or two years".
According to the Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be necessary "until a vaccine (possibly 18 months or more) is available."
William Schaffner of the University of Vanderbilt said, "I think it is unlikely that this coronavirus, since it is transmitted so easily, will disappear completely" and "may become a seasonal disease, which reappears every year."
The virulence of re-appearance would depend on collective immunity and the magnitude of mutation.
Symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively non-specific and infected people may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, sputum production in the airways (flemish), loss of sense of smell, lack of air, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, hemoptissis, diarrhoea or cyanosis. WHO states that approximately one in six people is seriously ill and has difficulty breathing.
According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, pressure or persistent pain in the chest, sudden confusion, difficulty waking up and blued color in the face or lips; in the face of these symptoms, immediate medical care is recommended. The further advance of the disease can cause severe pneumonia, acute respiratory disease, sepsis, septic shock and death.
Some of the infected individuals may be asymptomatic, do not have clinical symptoms, although the results of the test confirm the infection, therefore the researchers advised to carefully control and examine those who have close contact with confirmed infected people in order to rule out the infection.
Chinese estimates of the proportion of asymptomatic persons range from a few to 44 per cent.
The usual incubation period (the time between infection and onset of symptoms) covers one to 14 days; more often it is 5 days. As an example of uncertainty, the estimate of the proportion of people with COVID-19 who lost their sense of smell at first was 30% and then decreased to 15%.
Some details of how the disease is spread are still being determined.
The disease is believed to spread mainly during close contact and through small drops that occur when coughing, sneezing or talking; close contact is considered to be a distance of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
According to the studies, when coughing without covering the mouth, droplets can move from 4.5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some have proposed that the virus may also be transmitted through small drops that remain in the air for longer periods, which can be generated by talking. Respiratory droplets may also occur during exhalation, even when talking, although the virus is usually not transmitted through the air.
Droplets can enter the mouth or nose of people nearby or possibly inhale into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (PRC), can cause aerosolization of respiratory secretions and therefore air propagation.
It can also spread when one touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches the eyes, nose, or mouth.
While there is concern that it can be transmitted through faeces, this risk is believed to be low.
The Government of China denied the possibility of oral faecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more contagious during the first three days after symptoms appear, although propagation may be possible before symptoms are revealed and in more advanced stages of the disease.
People obtained positive results in disease tests up to three days before symptoms occur, indicating that transmission is possible before developing significant symptoms.
There are only a few asymptomatic reports confirmed by the laboratory, but some countries have identified asymptomatic transmission during contact tracking research.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) argues that although it is not fully clear how easy the disease is spread, usually one person infects another two or three. The virus survives from hours to days on the surface.
Specifically, it was determined that the virus is detectable for up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, one day in cardboard and up to four hours in copper.
This, however, varies according to humidity and temperature. Positive results were obtained in COVID-19 tests performed in pets and other animals.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although the British authorities recommend washing their hands after contact with animals, as well as after contact with other areas that could have touched infected persons.
Coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with the acute respiratory disease group in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the coronaviruses related to nature. Outside the human body, the virus dies when it comes into contact with soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. The SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is believed to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analyses revealed that coronavirus is genetically grouped with the genus betacoronavirus, its subgenre sarbecovirus (line B) together with two strains derived from bats.
At the full genome level, it is 96 % identical to other bat’s coronary virus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one difference in amino acids in certain parts of genome sequences between pangoline viruses and human viruses.
To date, the comparison of the complete genome indicated that the coronavirus of the pangolines and SARS-CoV-2 share up to 92 % of the genetic material, which is not sufficient to demonstrate that the pangolines are the intermediate host.
Virus infection may be provisionally diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, although ultimately confirmed by polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcriptase (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or by computed tomography images.
According to a study conducted in Wuhan comparing the chain reaction of polymerase to computed tomography, computed tomography is much more sensitive than the chain reaction of polymerase, although less specific, and many of the characteristics in the images coincide with the processes of other diseases and pneumonias.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends "not to use computed tomography as a detection method or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19".
WHO has published several RNA test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first published on 17 January.
The test uses the chain reaction of polymerase with real-time reverse transcriptase (rRT-PCR).
The test can be done in blood or respiratory samples.
The results are generally available within a few hours or days.
Usually, this test is performed with a nasopharyngeal hisopus, although a hisopus can also be used for the throat. Some laboratories and companies are developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
As at 6 April 2020, none of these proved to be sufficiently precise to approve their widespread use.
In the United States, a serological test developed by Cellex was approved for emergency use by certified laboratories only.
The characteristic features in the images of computed X-rays and tomography (TC) of symptomatic individuals include asymptomatic opacities in asymmetrically illustrated glass and absent pleural effusions.
The Italian Society of Radiology is compiling an online international database of results obtained in confirmed case images.
Due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, the diagnosis of non-confirmed images by polymerase chain reaction has limited specificity in the identification of COVID-19.
A comprehensive study conducted in China compared the results of chest computed to those of polymerase chain reaction and showed that, although the diagnosis by images is less specific to infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting its consideration as a detection tool in the areas affected by the epidemic.
Convolutional neural networks based on artificial intelligence were developed to detect virus characteristics in the images, both with X-rays and computed tomography.
Strategies to prevent transmission of the disease include maintaining good general personal hygiene, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with your hands without having washed them before, and sneezing or coughing on a disposable handkerchief and throwing your handkerchief directly into a waste container.
It is recommended that those who may already be infected wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission. Many Governments have restricted or discouraged all non-essential travel to and from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached the community propagation phase in many parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some members of the community do not know where or how they were infected. It is recommended that health care providers caring for someone who might be infected take standard precautions, contact precautions and use eye protection. The tracking of contacts is an important method for health authorities to determine the origin of an infection and to prevent further transmission.
The use of mobile phone location data by Governments for this purpose has generated concerns about privacy, and Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for limits on this type of surveillance.
Several mobile applications have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record a user's proximity to other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they were in close contact with someone who gave positive in the COVID-19 test. Wrong ideas are circulating about how to prevent infection; for example, nasal washing and mouthwashing throats are not effective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19, although many organizations are working to develop one.
Handwashing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with water and soap for at least twenty seconds, especially after using the bath or when they have their hands visibly dirty; before eating and after ringing their nose, coughing or sneezing.
This is because, outside the human body, the virus dies when it comes into contact with soap, which disintegrates its protective bubble.
The CDC also recommended using a disinfectant for alcohol-based hands with at least 60% alcohol in volume when water and soap are not available.
WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with their hands without having washed them before.
Surfaces may be decontaminated with several solutions (one minute after exposure to disinfectant on a stainless steel surface), including ethanol at 62–71 %, isopropanol at 50–100 %, sodium hypochlorite at 0,1 %, hydrogen peroxide at 0.5 % and iodine at 0,2–7,5 %.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that, if a case of COVID is suspected or confirmed in an installation, such as an office or nursery, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common spaces, shared electronic equipment, such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls and ATMs used by sick people are disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with flexed elbow or disposable handkerchief to cough or sneez, and that they immediately discard the scarf.
It is recommended that those who may be infected wear surgical masks, since the use of a mask may limit the volume and distance travelled by the respiratory droplets that are dispersed when speaking, sneezing and coughing.
WHO issued instructions on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Using a mask can reduce the tendency [of] people to touch their face, which is an important source of infection without proper hand hygiene."It has also been recommended to use masks in people who care for someone who might have the disease.
WHO has recommended the use of masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, for example, those who care for a person with COVID-19, although it also recognizes that wearing masks can help people avoid touching their face.
Several countries have begun to promote the use of masks by the public.
In the United States, CDC recommends wearing non-medical masks made with fabric. China specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks by healthy members of the public, especially when they are in close contact (1 metre (3 ft) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends using a surgical mask to take public transport or be in crowded locations.
Thai health officials recommend that people manufacture cloth masks in their homes and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia prohibited leaving public spaces without wearing a mask or without covering their nose and mouth.
On 16 March, Vietnam requested that all people wear a mask when they were in public spaces to be able to protect themselves and protect others.
The Austrian Government demanded the use of masks by all persons entering a supermarket.
Israel requested that all residents wear masks in public.
Taiwan, which has manufactured ten million masks per day since mid-March, on April 1, demanded the use of masks by passengers on inter-urban trains and buses.
Panama imposed the mandatory use of masks to go outdoors, while also recommends the manufacture of masks made at home to those who cannot buy them.
Masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (also known as physical distance) includes measures to control the infection designed to curb the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between individuals.
Methods include quarantines, travel restrictions and the closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters and shopping malls.
People can implement social distancing methods by staying in their homes, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using forms of greeting that do not include contact and physically distance from other people.
Many governments now demand or recommend social distancing in regions affected by the outbreak.
The maximum size of the meetings recommended by U.S. government agencies and health organizations was reduced rapidly from 250 people (if there was no known spread of COVID-19 in one region) to 50 people, and then to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public meetings of more than two people. Older adults and those with underlying diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension and compromised immune systems have a higher risk of suffering diseases and serious complications, and the CDC recommends that they stay in their homes as much as possible in the areas of the community affected by the outbreak. By the end of March 2020, WHO and other health agencies began to replace the use of the term "social distancing" with "physical distancing", to clarify that the objective is to reduce physical contact while maintaining social connections, whether virtually or at a distance.
The use of the term "social distancing" has had an impact on the assumption that people should adopt a complete social isolation rather than encourage them to stay in contact with other people through alternative means. Some authorities have published guidelines on sexual health to be used during the pandemic.
They include recommendations for having only sex with a person with whom you live, who does not have the virus or symptoms of the virus.
Self-inclusion at home was recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those suspected of having been infected.
The health agencies have published detailed instructions on appropriate self-inclusion, and many Governments have demanded or recommended the self-sustaining of entire populations in the affected areas.
The stricter autoquarantine instructions were issued for those belonging to high-risk groups.
People who may have been in contact with someone with COVID-19 and who have recently traveled to a country or region with widespread transmission are advised to make self-quarantine for 14 days from the last possible exposure.
Strategies to control an outbreak are restraint or suppression and mitigation.
The containment is carried out in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to identify and isolate infected persons, as well as to introduce other measures to control the infection and vaccines to prevent the disease from spreading to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to control the spread of the disease, efforts are transferred to the mitigation phase: measures are taken to curb the spread and mitigate its effects on the health system and society.
A combination of containment and mitigation measures can be taken at the same time.
The suppression requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic number of reproduction to less than 1. Part of controlling the outbreak of an infectious disease involves trying to reduce the epidemic peak, which is known as flattening the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of collapse of health services and allows more time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can control the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, use of masks and self-quarantenous; physical distancing Community measures, such as closure of schools and cancellation of massive competition events; community commitment to promote acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures and cleaning of surfaces. In China, more drastic measures were taken to contain the outbreak once its gravity became evident, for example, the implementation of quarantines in entire cities and the imposition of strict travel bans.
Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea implemented mass detection assessments and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected persons.
Singapore provided financial support to those infected who decided to do quarantine and imposed large fines on those who did not.
Taiwan has increased the production of masks and sanctioned the accumulation of medical supplies. simulations in Britain and the United States show that mitigation (which decreases the spread of the epidemic but does not stop it) and suppression (reversing the growth of the pandemic) have great challenges.
Optimum mitigation policies could reduce the maximum demand for medical care by two thirds and deaths by half, but still generate hundreds of thousands of deaths and the collapse of health systems.
Removal may be preferred, but it must be maintained throughout the time that the virus circulates in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if that happens first), since otherwise transmission is reactivated rapidly when the measures are flexible.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic involves social and economic costs.
There are no specific antiviral drugs approved for COVID-19, but efforts are being made to develop them, including testing existing medicines.
Taking free selling medicines for cooling, drinking liquids and rest may help relieve symptoms.
Depending on gravity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids and respiratory assistance may be required.
The use of steroids can worsen the results.
Several compounds that were previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being investigated for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO also indicated that some "home and traditional remedies" can relieve the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO describes increased capacity and adaptation of medical care to the needs of patients with COVID-19 as a fundamental measure of response to the outbreak.
ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have developed guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services for resource redistribution at different levels, including focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 tests, canceling optional procedures where possible, separating and insulating positive patients in COVID-19 and increasing intensive care capabilities through staff training and increasing the amount of available respirators and beds.
There are several theories about where the first case could have originated (the so-called zero patient).
The first case that was known of the new coronavirus can date back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Over a month, the number of cases of coronavirus in Hubei gradually increased.
These were mainly linked to the wholesale market of Huanan shellfish, which also sold live animals, and one theory is that the virus comes from one of these animals; or, in other words, it has a zoonotic origin. On December 26, a number of cases of unknown cause pneumonia were observed for which Dr. Zhang Jixian was in charge at Hubei Provincial Hospital, who informed the Jianghan CDC of Wuhan on December 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a "coronavirus similar to SARS".
The police advised eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, to spread false rumors, and another doctor, Ai Fen, was rebuked by his superiors for giving the alarm.
Subsequently, on 31 December, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public note and informed WHO.
In early January, sufficient cases of pneumonia of unknown cause were reported to the health authorities in Wuhan and to initiate an investigation. During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, contributing to migration for the Chinese New Year and the fact that Wuhan is a transport centre and a major railway crossing.
On January 20, China reported about 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
As of 20 January 2020, 6174 people had already developed symptoms. As of 26 March, the United States has surpassed China and Italy with the largest number of confirmed cases worldwide. As of 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died and more than 364 000 have recovered.
Around 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
Because of the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have restricted free movement and established border controls.
National reactions have included containment measures, such as quarantines (known as housekeeping orders, shelter orders in place or confinement) and curfews. On 2 April, approximately 300 million people, or approximately 90 per cent of the population, comply with some kind of confinement in the United States, more than 50 million people are confined in the Philippines, about 59 million people are confined in South Africa and 1300 million people are confined in India.
As at 26 March, 17 billion people around the world were carrying out some kind of confinement, which increased to 26 billion people two days later, about a third of the world ' s population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 dates back to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report indicates that the first case occurred on 17 November.
On 26 December, Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a group of cases of unknown cause pneumonia, and his hospital informed the Jianghan CDC of Wuhan on 27 December.
The first genetic tests of patient samples on December 27, 2019 indicated the presence of a coronavirus similar to SARS.
On 31 December, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public note.
WHO was reported on the same day.
While these notifications were being made, the police warned the doctors in Wuhan about spreading rumors about the outbreak.
The China National Health Commission at the outset stated that there was no "clear proof" of transmission between humans.
At the end of January, the Chinese Government launched a drastic campaign, later described by the Secretary General of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, as a "popular war", to contain the spread of the virus.
In what was described as "the greatest quarantine in the history of humanity", on 23 January a health cord was announced that prohibited travel within and outside Wuhan, this extended to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, and affected a total of about 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles in the city was prohibited.
The celebrations of the Chinese New Year were cancelled (January 25th) in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, the Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Later, another hospital, the Leishenshan Hospital, was built to receive more patients.
In addition to the new hospitals built, China also converted another 14 facilities in Wuhan, as convention centres and stadiums, into temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the Government implemented further measures to contain the outbreak of COVID-19, which included the issuance of health statements for travellers and the extension of the Spring Festival holiday.
Universities and schools were also closed throughout the country.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions implemented several measures, especially in relation to schools and universities.
Remote labour measures were established in several regions of China.
Travel restrictions were implemented both inside and outside Hubei.
Public transport was modified and museums temporarily closed throughout China.
Public movement control was implemented in several cities, and it has been estimated that approximately 760 million people (over half of the population) faced some kind of restriction to outdoors. After the beginning of the global outbreak phase in March, the Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the "import" of the virus from other countries.
For example, Beijing has imposed a 14-day mandatory quarantine for all international travellers entering the city. On 23 March, in mainland China only one case had been transmitted at the national level in the previous five days, on this occasion, through a traveler returning from Istanbul to Canton.
On 24 March 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that the spread of transmitted cases at national level was essentially blocked and that the outbreak had been controlled in China.
On the same day, the travel restrictions in Hubei as well as Wuhan were flexible two months after confinement had been imposed. On 26 March 2020, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that the entry of visa holders or residence permits would be suspended from 28 March, without specific details of when this policy will end.
Those wishing to enter China should apply for visas in Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Government of China urged companies and factories to reopen on 30 March and provided economic stimulus packages for signatures. The Council of State stated a mourning day that it will begin with a national moment of silence of three minutes on 4 April at 10:00, coincidering with the Qingming Festival, although the central government asked families to submit their respect online to meet the physical distance in order to avoid the outbreak of the COVID-19.
On 20 January 2020, it was confirmed that COVID-19 spread from China to South Korea.
On 20 February, the country's health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases, mainly attributed to a meeting in Daegu of a new religious movement known as the Church of Jesus Shincheonji.
It is suspected that the devotees of Shincheonji who visited Daegu from Wuhan were the origin of the outbreak.
On 22 February, of the 9336 church followers, 1261 or approximately 13% reported symptoms. On 23 February 2020, South Korea declared the maximum warning level.
On 28 February, more than 2000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, which increased to 3150 on 29 February.
All South Korean military bases remained quarantined after the evidence confirmed that three soldiers gave positive for the virus.
Airline schedules were also affected, and were therefore modified. South Korea presented what was considered the world's largest and best organized programme to test the virus in the population and isolate infected people, as well as to identify and quarantine those who were in contact with them.
The methods of detection included mandatory self-reporting of symptoms by newly arrived people from other countries through a mobile application, drive-thru centers to perform virus detection tests with available results the following day and increased diagnostic capacity to be able to test by up to 20,000 people every day.
The South Korea programme is considered a success in controlling the outbreak despite not adopting quarantine in entire cities. South Korea was initially polarized with respect to President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed requests to demand Moon's removal, so they considered it to be a mismanagement of the outbreak by the Government, or to commend their response.
On 23 March, South Korea was reported to have total cases on a lower day in four weeks.
On 29 March, it was reported that as from 1 April, all newly arrived persons from abroad are expected to remain quarantined for two weeks.
According to media reports, on 1 April, South Korea received requests for assistance for virus testing from 121 different countries.
On 19 February, Iran reported its first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Qom, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died later that day.
Early measures announced by the Government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural events, sporting events and Friday prayers, and the closure of universities, higher education institutions and schools.
Iran allocated five billion rials to fight the virus.
On 26 February 2020, President Hassan Rouhani said that there were no plans to quarantine the areas affected by the outbreak, and that only people would be quarantined.
In March, plans were announced to limit travel between cities, although heavy traffic between cities as a result of the New Persian Year Nowruz continued.
Shi'an shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020. During February, Iran became a virus propagation center after China.
In the light of the allegations of a cover-up of the magnitude of the outbreak in Iran, more than ten countries had traced their cases to Iran by 28 February, indicating that the size of the outbreak could be more serious than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian Government by that date.
The Iranian Parliament closed, and on 3 March 23 of its 290 members reported positive results in the virus test.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch urged Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained on peaceful grounds, and to temporarily release all eligible prisoners.
He indicated that there is a greater risk of the spread of the virus in closed institutions, such as detention centres, which also lack adequate medical care.
On 15 March, the Iranian Government reported 100 deaths on the same day, the largest recorded number in the country since the beginning of the outbreak.
As at 17 March, at least 12 Iranian expolitics or politicians had died from the disease.
As of March 23, Iran experienced 50 new cases per hour and a new death every ten minutes due to the coronavirus.
According to one WHO official, there may be five times as many cases in Iran as reported.
It is also suggested that US sanctions on Iran could affect the country's financial capacity to respond to the viral outbreak.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has demanded relief from economic sanctions for the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On 31 January, the spread of the outbreak to Italy was confirmed, when two Chinese tourists gave positive in the SARS-CoV-2 tests in Rome.
Cases began to increase rapidly, leading the Italian Government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare the state of emergency.
Subsequently, a group of unrelated COVID-19 cases was detected, which began with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced a new decree to contain the outbreak, which included quarantine of more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "It is not allowed to enter or leave the areas affected by the outbreak.
The suspension of labour activities and sporting events in these areas has already been ordered." On 4 March, the Italian Government ordered the complete closure of schools and universities throughout the country while Italy reached 100 deaths.
All important sporting events, including the Serie A football matches, were to be held at closed doors until April, but, on March 9, all sporting events were completely suspended for at least one month.
On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte ordered the interruption of virtually all commercial activities except supermarkets and pharmacies. On 6 March, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published medical ethics recommendations on the screening protocols that could be used.

On 22 March, it was reported that Russia had sent nine military aircraft with medical equipment to Italy.
As at 5 April, there were 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 recoveries in Italy, and most of these cases occurred in the Lombardy region.
A CNN report indicated that the combination of Italy of a large elderly population and the inability to test all people who have the virus so far could contribute to the high lethality rate.
The UK response to the virus first emerged as one of the most relaxed affected countries, and until 18 March 2020, the British Government did not impose any kind of social or quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the Government received criticism of the apparent lack of speed and intensity in response to public concerns. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made an announcement in which he discouraged social contact and all non-essential travel, and suggested that people work from their homes whenever possible and avoid places such as bars, restaurants and theaters.
On 20 March, the Government announced the closure as soon as possible of all leisure establishments, such as bars and gymnasiums, and promised to pay up to 80% of workers' salaries up to a limit of GBP 2500 per month to prevent unemployment during the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced stricter social distancing measures, which prohibited meetings of more than two persons and restricted travel and outdoor activities to those considered strictly necessary.
Unlike previous measures, the police could require compliance with these restrictions through the imposition of fines and the dispersion of meetings.
The closure of most companies was ordered, with the exception of those considered "essential", including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, gas stations and workshops.

WHO commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities in controlling and restraining the epidemic.
WHO noted the difference between the outbreak of SARS 2002–2004, when the Chinese secretism authorities were accused of preventing prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis, in which the central Government "has provided periodic updates to prevent panic in the New Year's holidays".
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to implement a transport ban in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galea noted that although "definitely it was not a recommendation made by WHO", it was "a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic in the place where it is most concentrated" and said that "it had no precedents in the history of public health." On 30 January, following the confirmation of the transmission between human beings outside China and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international importance (ESPII), the sixth SPII since the measure was first invoked during the 2009 swine flu pandemic.
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom said that SPII was "at the risk of global spread, especially to low- and middle-income countries without solid health systems".
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that "there is no reason to take measures that interfere unnecessarily with international trade and travel" and that "WHO does not recommend limiting trade or movement".
On 5 February, WHO appealed to the global community for a contribution of $675 million to fund strategic preparation in low-income countries, and cited the urgency to support those countries "who do not have systems to detect people who contracted the virus, if any."
Tedros also made statements stating that "we are as strong as our weakest link" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay more in the future." On February 11, WHO announced at a press conference that COVID-19 was the name of the disease.
On the same day, Tedros stated that the Secretary-General of the United Nations, António Guterres, had agreed to provide the “power of the entire United Nations system in response”.
As a result, a United Nations crisis management team was activated, which allowed coordination of the response of all the United Nations, which, according to WHO, will enable them to "focus on the health response while other agencies can provide their expertise to address the broader social, economic and development implications of the outbreak".
On 14 February, a joint WHO-led mission team with China was launched to provide international experts and WHO on the ground in China to assist in national management and evaluate "the severity and communicability of the disease" through the organization of workshops and meetings with major institutions at the national level and to carry out site visits to assess the "impact of response activities at the provincial and county levels, including urban and rural environments". On 25 February, WHO stated that "the world must do more to prepare for a possible pandemic of coronavirus", and noted that, although it was still very soon to be called the pandemic, countries nevertheless should be "in a preparatory phase".
In response to a developing outbreak in Iran, WHO sent there a joint mission team to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials said that the global assessment of the coronavirus threat would rise from "high" to "very high", its highest level of alert and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO's health emergency program, warned in a statement that "This is a verification of reality for all global governments: wake up.
This virus can be on its way and we must be prepared," insisting that adequate response measures could help the world avoid "the worst."
Ryan also said that current data did not guarantee that public health officials declared a global pandemic, and noted that such a declaration would mean that "we are basically accepting that all human beings on the planet will be exposed to that virus."
On March 11, WHO declared the outbreak of coronavirus pandemic.
The Director General said that WHO was "very concerned, both by the alarming levels of spread and gravity, as well as by the alarming levels of inaction." WHO has received important criticisms, so it is considered inadequate management of the pandemic, including the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
The negative response included the request for the resignation of WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom, signed by 733 000 people on 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of United Nations human rights experts emphasized that the rights of all persons were respected during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expert group indicated that everyone has the right to life-saving interventions and that the Government has this responsibility.
The group stressed that the lack of resources or medical insurance should never be used as a justification for discrimination against a specific group.
The experts emphasized that all persons have the right to health, including persons with disabilities, those belonging to minority groups, older persons, internally displaced persons, homeless persons, those living in extreme poverty, detained persons, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups requiring government support.
International government organizations are addressing the social and economic impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development launched a platform to provide comprehensive and timely information on political responses in countries around the world, in addition to points of view and advice.

The Government of China has been criticized by the United States, the Minister of the Office of the United Kingdom Cabinet, Michael Gove, and the son of the president of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro, for his management of the pandemic, which began in the Chinese province of Hubei.
Several administrators were fired at the provincial level of the Chinese Communist Party (PCC) because of their management of quarantine efforts in Central China, a sign of discontent with the political system's response to the outbreak in those regions.
Some commentators believe that this measure was taken to protect the Secretary General of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, from public anger by the outbreak of coronavirus.
Some Chinese officials, for example, Zhao Lijian, rejected a previous recognition of the beginning of the Coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, in favor of conspiracy theories on the origin of COVID-19 in the United States or Italy.
The administration of Donald Trump of the United States has referred to the coronavirus as the "China virus" or the "Wuhan virus", and stated that the "Censorship of China overfed a virus that has now become a global pandemic", which in turn was pointed out by some critics as racism and "distraction of its administration's failure to contain the disease".
The Daily Beast obtained a telegram from the U.S. Government describing a stratagem of communications with apparent origin in the National Security Council, and cited the strategy as "All about China".
We have been told that we are trying to convey this message in any way possible, including press conferences and television shows. "Media such as Politics, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have stated that China's efforts to send aid to the countries affected by the virus are part of a propaganda to gain global influence.
EU foreign policy representative Josep Borrell warned that "there is a geopolitical component that includes a struggle for influence through propaganda and generosity policy".
Borrell also said that "China is aggressively pushing the message that unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner."
China also called for the United States to lift its sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while, according to reports, it sent aid to the latter two countries.
On 3 April, United States sanctions blocked the donation of Jack Ma of 100,000 masks to Cuba.
The US authorities were also accused of diverting aid to other countries to their own country.
And disputes have been reported concerning masks among other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland; and between the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey seized hundreds of respirators destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian Government criticized the European Union's lack of solidarity with Italy, which was affected by the coronavirus.
Maurizio Massari, Ambassador of Italy to the European Union, said that "Only China responded bilaterally.
This is certainly not a good sign of European solidarity."
On 22 March, after a telephone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the Russian army to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa cited an anonymous "high-level political source" which claimed that 80% of Russia's aid was "useless or of little use for Italy".
The source accused Russia of initiating a "geopolitical and diplomatic" seduction offensive.
The president of Lombardy, Attilio Fontana, and the Italian Foreign Minister, Luigi Di Maio, rejected the journalistic reports and expressed their appreciation.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical aid to the United States.
Kremlin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said that "by offering help to American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that, when U.S. materials and medical equipment manufacturers cover impulse, they can also match if necessary."
NATO's planned military "Defender 2020" exercise in Germany, Poland and the Baltic countries, the largest NATO war exercise since the end of the Cold War, will take place on a small scale.
The Secretary-General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Kate Hudson, criticized the Defence 2020 exercise: "In the current public health crisis, it endangers not only the lives of the United States troops and the various European countries involved, but also those of the people of the countries in which they operate."The Iranian Government was greatly affected by the virus, with about two dozen members of Parliament infected, as well as fifteen other current and previous political figures.
On 14 March 2020, Iran's president Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders to ask for help, saying that his country is having difficulty fighting the outbreak due to the lack of access to international markets as a result of United States sanctions against Iran. The outbreak prompted the United States to adopt common social policies in other rich countries, such as universal medical care, universal child care, paid family leave and higher levels of public health funds.
Political analysts anticipated that it could negatively affect Donald Trump's re-election possibilities in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea worsened due to the pandemic.
South Korea criticized Japan's "ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts" after Japan announced that anyone from South Korea would remain quarantined for two weeks at government-designated sites.
South Korean society at first was polarized with respect to Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed requests to demand the removal of Moon, so they considered it to be a mismanagement of the outbreak by the Government, or to commend their response. The pandemic has allowed countries to approve emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators have expressed concern that it could enable Governments to strengthen their control of power.
In Hungary, his Parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by decree indefinitely, suspend Parliament and the elections and punish those who are deemed to have spread false information about the virus and the management of the crisis by the Government.
The outbreak of coronavirus was blamed on a number of instances of supply shortages, as a result of increased worldwide use of equipment to combat outbreaks, panic-driven purchases and interruptions of logistics and factory operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about the shortage of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and interruption of suppliers.
Several localities also witnessed panic-driven purchases that left the shelves empty of essential products, such as food, toilet paper and bottled water, which caused the shortage of supplies.
The technology sector, in particular, has been warning about delays in electronic product shipments.
According to WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protection equipment increased by 100 times.
This demand generated an increase in prices of up to twenty times the normal price and also caused delays of four to six months in the supply of medical goods.
It also caused a shortage of personal protection equipment worldwide, and WHO warned that this would put health workers at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for buyers to sell Australian products in China.
The activity has created a shortage of baby formula in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian Government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the subsequent demand for food products, none of these areas were affected by acute food shortages.
China and Italy's measures against the illicit accumulation and trade in essential products have been successful, and have avoided an acute shortage of food that was anticipated in Europe and North America.
Northern Italy, with its important agricultural production, has not had a significant reduction, but prices could increase, according to representatives of the sector.
Food shelves were only temporarily empty, even in the city of Wuhan, while Chinese government officials released pigmeat reserves to ensure adequate food for the population.
Similar laws require food producers to maintain reserves for these emergencies in Italy.
The damage to the world economy was felt in China: according to a journalistic report of 16 March, the Chinese economy was greatly affected in the first two months of 2020 due to measures taken by the Government to stop the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell by 20.5%.
As mainland China is an important economic and manufacturing centre, the viral outbreak has been considered a significant threat of destabilization for the world economy.
Agathe Demarais of The Economist Intelligence Unit has predicted that markets will remain volatile until a clearer picture of potential consequences emerges.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic consequences of the global growth epidemic could exceed those of the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak.
An estimate by an expert at the University of Washington in San Luis indicated an impact of more than $300 billion on the world supply chains that could last up to two years.
It is reported that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) was "revolved" after a sharp fall in oil prices due to China's lowest demand.
On 24 February, global securities markets fell due to a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
On 27 February, due to growing concerns about the outbreak of coronavirus, several U.S. stock market indices, including NASDAQ-100, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average published their most pronounced falls since 2008, the Dow dropped 1191 points, the largest drop in one day since the 2007–08 financial crisis.
The three indices ended the week with reductions of more than 10 %.
On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH affirmed the sovereign credit rating of China, but maintained a negative outlook.
The actions fell again on the basis of fear for the coronavirus, the biggest fall occurred on March 16.
Many believe that there is likely to be an economic recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures of the states and central banks.
Central banks are reacting faster than they reacted to the financial collapse of 2008.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to travel bans, the closure of public places that include travel attractions and the recommendation of Governments not to travel anywhere in the world.
As a result, many airlines have cancelled flights due to the lowest demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, while the British regional airline Flybe collapsed.
The impact on the cruise companies sector reached a level never seen before.
Several railway stations and ferry terminals have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with the Chunyun, an important travel season related to Chinese New Year's holidays.
Several events involving large crowds were cancelled by national and regional governments, including New Year's festivals, while private companies also independently closed their shops and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many events and tourist attractions of the Lunar New Year have been closed to avoid mass concentrations, including the Forbidden City of Beijing and traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, municipalities and regions of China, the authorities extended the New Year's holiday until 10 February, and ordered most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions account for 80% of GDP and 90% of the country's exports.
Hong Kong raised its level of response to the infectious disease to the highest and declared an emergency, closed schools until March and canceled its New Year celebrations. The retail sector was affected worldwide, with reductions in attendance times or temporary closures.
Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America decreased by 40%.
The retailers in North America and the Middle East experienced a fall of 50 to 60%.
This also led to a 33 to 43% fall in pedestrian traffic to shopping centres in March compared to February.
The operators of the shopping centres around the world imposed additional measures, as more hygiene, to install thermal scanners to control the temperature of buyers and to cancel events. According to an estimate by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the pandemic-induced recession could leave between 14 and 22 million more people in an extreme poverty situation in Latin America than they had remained in that situation without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the highest point of the Wuhan epidemic, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of the nearly 300 million migrant rural workers from China were stranded in their homes in interior provinces or trapped in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and requested government assistance.
The Coronavirus outbreak could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32%, according to estimates from the San Luis Federal Reserve Bank. The confinement in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (who receive daily wages) unemployed. According to the Angus Reid Institute survey, 44% of Canadian households experienced some type of unemployment. Approximately 900,000 workers lost their jobs in Spain since the confinement began in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a universal credit plan. Nearly half a million companies in Germany have implemented short-term work schemes subsidized by the Government, known as Kurzarbeit, for its workers.
The German short-term work compensation scheme has been adopted by France and Britain.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors were deeply affected by the pandemic, which affected the operations of organizations and people, both employed and independent, worldwide.
Culture and arts organizations sought to carry out their mission (often financed from public funds) to provide the community with access to cultural heritage, maintain the safety of its employees and the public and support artists when possible.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, venues and other cultural institutions had closed indefinitely, and their exhibitions, events and shows had been cancelled or postponed.
In response, great efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent consequence that increases at an accelerated rate of the disease is the cancellation of religious services. Important sporting events and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion parades.
The film industry also suffered interruptions. The Vatican announced the cancellation of the Holy Week celebrations in Rome, which take place during the last week of the Lent Christian Penance season.
Many dioceses have recommended that older Christians stay in their homes rather than attend Mass on Sundays; some churches offered religious services through radio, live broadcast on the Internet or television, while others offer spaces to pray from the automobile.
After the decision of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome to close its churches and chapels and with the empty St. Peter's Square of Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also cancelled their services and limited public concentrations in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
Iran's Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday's prayers in the areas affected by the outbreak and then the sanctuaries were closed, while Saudi Arabia prohibited the entry of foreign pilgrims and their residents to the sacred places in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most significant alteration in the world sports calendar since World War II.
Most major sporting events were cancelled or postponed, including the UEFA Champions League 2019–20, the Premier League 2019-20, the UEFA Euro 2020, the NBA 2019–20 season and the NHL season 2019–20.
The outbreak interrupted the plans of the 2020 Olympic Games, which were originally scheduled to start at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event "will be rescheduled for a later date than 2020 but not after the summer of 2021". Casinos and other gaming venues around the world closed and online poker tournaments were postponed or cancelled.
This caused many gamblers to use the Internet, many online betting sites reported significant increases in their new registration rates. The entertainment industry was also affected, several music groups suspended or cancelled concert tours.
Many large theaters, such as Broadway theatres, also suspended all shows.
Some artists have explored ways of continuing to produce and share their work via the Internet as an alternative to the traditional live show, such as live broadcasts of concerts or the creation of "festives" on the Internet for artists to interpret, distribute or publish their work.
Online, many Internet memes were spread over the coronavirus, as many resort to humor and distraction in the midst of uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of the COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudices, xenophobia and racism towards people of Chinese and East Asian descent, and towards people in the areas of Europe, the United States and other countries where the situation is critical.
There have been incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports of February (when most cases were still limited to China) have documented racist feelings in various groups around the world expressing that Chinese deserved the virus or that they were receiving what they considered to be a just reprisal.
Some countries in Africa have also seen an increase in old-fashioned feelings.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination on the basis of their regional origin.
Chinese and those in areas affected by the virus have received support, both on the Internet and outside.
Following the advance of the outbreak to new countries where the situation is critical, the people of Italy, the first country in Europe who experienced a serious outbreak of COVID-19, could also be suspected and xenophobia. Citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed petitions for the prohibition of Chinese entry into their countries in an effort to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChinaDontComeToJapan was a trend on Twitter.
Chinese, in addition to other Asian people in the United Kingdom and the United States, have reported higher levels of racist insults, as well as aggressions.
The president of the United States, Donald Trump, was criticized for referring to the coronavirus as the "China virus", a term that many critics considered racist and anti-Chinese.
Demonstrators in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainian and foreign evacuees from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
It is reported that students from northeastern India, who share a border with China, who study in major Indian cities, suffered harassment in relation to the Coronavirus outbreak.
The president of the state unit of the Bharatiya Janata party in West Bengal, Dilip Ghosh, said that the Chinese had destroyed nature and "that is why God avenged themselves of them."
The Chinese consulate in Calcutta then condemned the comments and said they were "wrong". In China, xenophobia and racism toward non-Chinese residents were increased as a result of the pandemic, and foreigners were described as "foreign waste" and intended for "desire".
Many newspapers with payment walls removed them for parts or all of their coverage of the coronavirus.
Many scientific editors published scientific articles related to the outbreak available with open access.
Some scientists chose to share their results quickly on preprint servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory tests for the 2019 coronavirus respiratory disease (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus include methods that detect the presence of the virus and those that detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed through the chain reaction test of polymerase with reverse transcriptase, which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and is designed to detect only SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
The detection of antibodies (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and surveillance of the population.
Antibodies tests show how many people have had the disease, including those who had too mild symptoms to inform them or were asymptomatic.
Based on the results of this test, a precise mortality rate of the disease and the level of collective immunity in the population can be determined.
Due to limited evidence, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population until March 2020.
As at 23 March, no country had tested more than 3 per cent of its population, and there were large variations in the number of tests carried out in the various countries.
This variability is also likely to significantly affect mortality rates by reported cases, which are likely to be greatly overestimated in some countries.
Through the chain reaction of polymerase with real-time reverse transcriptase (rRT-PCR), the test can be done in respiratory samples obtained through various methods, including nasopharyngeal hysopates or sputum samples.
The results are usually available within a few hours up to 2 days.
The polymerase chain reaction test with reverse transcriptase performed with pharyngeal hysopates is only reliable in the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus may disappear in the throat, but it continues to multiply in the lungs.
In infected people who are tested in the second week, as an alternative, the sample material can be obtained from the deep parts of the airways by suction catheter, or the material that is expelled from the cough (spute) may be used.
One of the first chain reaction tests of polymerase was developed in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020, using the real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and formed the basis of the 250,000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
As of January 23, 2020, the United Kingdom had also developed a test. On January 28, 2020, the South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on the clinical grade polymerase chain reaction (PowerCheck Coronavirus).
Finds the "E" gene shared by all betacoronavirus and the SARS-CoV-2 specific RdRp gene. In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to obtain the approval of emergency use of the National Medical Products Administration of China of a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on polymerase chain reaction. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are distributing their polymerase chain reaction diagnostic panel with real-time reverse transcriptase for the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) to public health laboratories through the International reagent resource.
One in three genetic tests in the previous versions of the test kits generated unfinished results due to defective reagents, and a blocking in conducting tests in the CDC in Atlanta; as a result, on average, less than 100 samples per day were successfully processed throughout February 2020.
The reliability of the tests using two components was not determined until 28 February 2020, and only since then was it possible for state and local laboratories to start testing.
The Food and Drug Administration approved the test under an emergency authorisation. The U.S. commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
As at 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the national availability of COVID-19 tests based on polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcriptase.
Similarly, as at 9 March 2020, Quest Diagnostics provided evidence for COVID-19 at national level.
No limits were announced in the quantity; the collection of specimens and processing should be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDCs.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Research Centre for Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was recorded by the Federal Medical Care Surveillance Service. On 12 March 2020, it was reported that Mayo Clinic had developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received approval from the FDA for a test that could be carried out within 3.5 hours in large volume, allowing a machine to carry out approximately 4128 tests within 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency authorisation for Abbott Laboratories for a test in Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued similar authorisations for Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cephaid likewise received the FDA emergency authorisation for a test that takes approximately 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test using isothermal amplification technology for nucleic acids instead of polymerase chain reaction.
As this does not require a series of alternate temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Currently, there are about 18,000 of these machines in the United States and Abbott plans to increase production to carry out 50,000 tests per day. In Taiwan, a test is being developed using a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the nucleocapside protein (N-protein) of the new coronavirus, hoping that it can provide results within 15 to 20 minutes as well as a rapid test for influenza.
In March 2020, the review of the publications concluded that "thorax X-rays have little diagnostic value in the early stages, while CT results [computed tomography] can be obtained even before symptoms occur".
Typical features in CT include bilateral multilobar opacity in glass illustrated with a peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution.
As the disease progresses, subpleural domain develops, pattern in foot-and-mouth disease and consolidation.
According to a study conducted in Wuhan, at the point of origin of the current pandemic, in which the chain reaction of polymerase was compared with computed tomography, computed tomography is much more sensitive than the chain reaction of polymerase, although less specific, and many of the characteristics in the images coincide with the processes of other diseases and pneumonias.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends "not to use computed tomography as a detection method or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19." Since March 2020, the CDCs recommend the chain reaction of polymerase as an initial examination.
Part of the immune system reaction to infection is antibody production, including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to detect infection in people approximately 7 days after symptoms have occurred, to determine immunity and population surveillance. Analysis can be performed in central laboratories or by testing at the point of attention.
High-performance automated systems in many clinical laboratories may perform these analyses, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For analysis in central laboratories, a single specimen of peripheral blood is generally used, although serious specimens can be used to follow the immune response.
For the tests at the attention point, a single specimen of blood is usually obtained by puncture in the skin.
Unlike polymerase chain reaction methods, there is no need for an extraction step prior to the analysis. On March 26, 2020, the FDA appointed 29 entities that provided notification to the agency as appropriate and can now distribute their antibody tests.
At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received approval from Europe for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The ability to perform tests is several hundred samples within the time limit and is therefore much faster than the conventional chain reaction test of viral RNA polymerase.
Antibodies can usually be detected 14 days after the start of the infection. In early April, the United Kingdom discovered that none of the antibody test kits it purchased were good enough to use them.
Hong Kong has created a program in which suspicious patients can stay in their homes, "the emergency department gives the patient a specimen tube", the patient spits in the tube, sends it and gets a result within a short time. British NHS announced that it is implementing a pilot program to analyze suspicious cases in their homes, which eliminates the risk that the patient will infect others if he goes to the hospital or the need to disinfect an ambulance if one is used. In the tests at drive-through centers for COVID-19 of suspicious cases, a health professional takes samples with appropriate precautions.
The drive-through centres have helped South Korea to do some of the fastest and most extensive tests in any country. In Germany, the National Association of Health Insurance Physicians Estudiaries said on 2 March that it had a capacity for approximately 12,000 tests per day in the outpatient environment and that 10,700 people had been tested the previous week.
Health insurance assumes the costs when the test is ordered by a doctor.
According to President Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a general capacity to do 160 000 tests per week.
As of March 19, evidence was offered through the drive-through system in several large cities.
As at 26 March 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown because only the positive results were reported.
A first laboratory survey revealed that, in the natural week of 12/2020, at least 483 295 samples had been analysed, up to and including the week of 12/2020, and 33 491 samples (6.9%) had positive results for the SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers at the Technion Institute and the Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method to analyze samples of 64 patients simultaneously, which consists of grouping samples and only doing further analysis if the combined sample is positive. On 5 February 2020, in Wuhan, the BGI opened an emergency lab of 2000 square metres called "Huo-Yan" (China:  cut-off, or "Fire Eye" in English), which can process more than 10,000 samples per day.
With the construction, which was supervised by the founder of the BGI, Wang Jian, and which took 5 days, the model showed that the cases in Hubei had been 47 % higher and that the corresponding cost to deal with quarantine had doubled without this capacity for conducting tests.
After the Wuhan laboratory, Huo-Yan laboratories were immediately built in Shenzhen, Tianjín, Beijing and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities in China.
As of March 4, 2020, total daily production was 50 000 tests per day. Multiplexed open source designs were implemented provided by origami analysis that allow to evaluate up to 1122 samples of patients for COVID19 using only 93 analyses. These balanced designs can be used in small laboratories without the need to use liquid-handling robots.
By March, insufficient scarcity and quantities of reagents affected massive evidence in the European Union and the US.
This led some authors to explore sample preparation protocols that involve heating the samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for further testing. On March 31, it was announced that United Arab Emirates was now doing more testing of coronary virus per person in its population than any other country, and was directed to increase the level of testing to cover the majority of the population.
This was achieved through the combination of drive-through capacity and the purchase of a mass production laboratory at the level of the population of Group 42 and BGI (based on its "Huo-Yan" emergency detection laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory has the capacity to perform tens of thousands of polymerase chain reaction tests with reverse transcriptase per day and is the first in the world of this magnitude that works outside China.
Different test formulas were developed that address different parts of the genetic profile of the coronavirus in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted the German formula for manufacturing kits that sent low-income countries that did not have the resources to develop their own kits.
The German formula was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was not available until 28 January, which delayed the available evidence in the United States. China and the United States had problems with the reliability of test kits at the beginning of the outbreak, and these countries and Australia were unable to supply sufficient kits to meet the demand and recommendations of health experts on evidence.
On the contrary, experts say that the great availability of South Korea tests helped reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The Government of South Korea has achieved its capacity for testing, mainly in private sector laboratories, over several years.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for an increase in testing programmes as the best way to reduce the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic. High demand for evidence due to the widespread spread of the virus resulted in delays of hundreds of thousands of tests in private U.S. laboratories, and supplies of hisopates and chemical reagents were exhausted.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDCs had "defects"; the government then eliminated bureaucratic barriers that had prevented private testing. Spain bought test kits to the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but obtained inaccurate results.
The company explained that the incorrect results could be due to incorrect sampling or incorrect use of the kits.
The Ministry of Spain said that it would withdraw the kits that dropped incorrect results and replace them with a different test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic purchased from China gave incorrect results. Slovakia bought 1.2 million kits to China that turned out to be imprecise.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested that they be thrown into the Danube. Ateş Kara, Turkish Ministry of Health, said that the test kits that Turkey purchased from China had a "high error rate" and did not "put them into use". The United Kingdom bought 3.5 million test kits in China, but early April 2020 announced that they were not serving.
The conduct of tests, supplemented by the quarantine of those who obtained positive results and the identification of those with whom they had contacted those who gave positive results at SARS-CoV-2, resulted in satisfactory results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the place where the first COVID-19 death occurred in Italy, conducted two rounds of tests throughout the population of about 3400 inhabitants, with about ten days of difference.
Approximately half of the people who obtained positive results had no symptoms, and all the cases detected were quarantined.
With the restriction of travel in the municipality, this completely eliminated the new infections.
With intensive contact tracking, travel restrictions from abroad, testing and quarantine, the 2020 Coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has advanced much slower than in other developed countries, but have not applied extreme restrictions, such as forced closure of restaurants and retail establishments.
Many events were cancelled, and on March 28, Singapore began recommending residents to stay in their homes, but schools were reopened in time after the March 23 holiday.
Other countries have also controlled the pandemic with intensive contact tracking, travel restrictions from abroad, testing and quarantine, but with less stringent boundaries, such as Iceland and South Korea.
According to a statistical study, countries that have conducted more tests, in relation to the number of deaths, have lethality rates for cases far lower, probably because these countries have more capacity to detect people who have only mild symptoms or who have no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that are unable to carry out tests and that have national laboratories with limited experience at COVID-19 send out their first five positive samples and their first ten negative samples for COVID-19 to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmation.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the column "Positive as % of evidence" is influenced by the policy for carrying out the country's tests.
A country that conducts tests only in persons entering hospitals will have a higher positive number as % of evidence that a country that conducts tests in all citizens, whether they show symptoms or not, the other issues are the same.
Handwashing, also known as hand hygiene, is the action to wash your hands in order to eliminate dirt, fat, microorganisms or other unwanted substances.
The constant washing of hands with soap in certain "critical moments" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted via fecal-oral means.
People may also be infected with respiratory diseases such as influenza or common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e. mucosal membranes).
The five critical moments during the day when washing hands with soap is important include: before and after defecation, after cleaning a child's tail or changing diapers, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing a meal or handling raw meat, fish or poultry meat.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be cleaned with ashes. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before, during and after preparing meals.
Before and after caring for a sick person.
After changing diapers or cleaning a child who used the bathroom.
After the nose is ringing, coughing or sneezing.
After touching animals, feed or animal waste.
Hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before administering medicines or medical care may prevent or minimize the spread of diseases.
The main medical purpose of handwashing is to remove pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause damage or disease from their hands.
This is especially important for people who manipulate food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Handwashing has many benefits for health, including minimizing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and reduce the infant mortality rate in domestic deliveries.
A 2013 study showed that improvements in hand-washing practices can generate small improvements in the growth of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases can be reduced by introducing simple changes in behaviour, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple action can reduce almost 50% the mortality rate for these diseases.
Interventions that promote handwashing can reduce diarrhea episodes by about a third, and this is similar to providing drinking water in low-income areas.
48% of reductions in diarrhea episodes can be related to hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap is the most effective and economical way to prevent acute diarrhea and respiratory infections, such as automatic behavior adopted in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, a major acute respiratory disease, is the main cause of mortality in children under five years of age, and lives of an estimated 1.8 million children per year are charged.
Diarrhea and pneumonia together account for nearly 3.5 million infant deaths per year.
According to UNICEF, converting handwashing with soap before eating and after using the bath in a rooted habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, which would reduce the deaths by diarrhea by almost half and a quarter deaths by acute respiratory infections.
Handwashing is usually integrated with other hygiene interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene programmes (WASH).
Handwashing also protects against impetigo, which is transmitted through direct physical contact.
A small harmful effect of handwashing is that its frequent realization can cause skin damage due to skin dryness.
According to a Danish study conducted in 2012, excessive handwashing can cause skin disease that causes itching and causes skin to become squamous known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially common in health workers.
Handwashing too common is also considered one of the symptoms of compulsive obsessive disorder (TOC).
There are five critical moments during the day when washing of hands with soap is important to reduce oral-fecal transmission of diseases: after using the bath (to urinate, defecate), after cleaning the tail of a child (to change diapers), before feeding a child, before eating and before/after preparing a meal or handling raw meat, fish or poultry meat.
Other times where a proper hand washing technique should be practiced to prevent transmission of diseases include before and after treatment of a cut or wound; after sneezing, coughing or ringing the nose; after touching animal waste or handling animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, there is a low rate of handwashing with soap.
A study on handwashing in 54 countries in 2015 concluded that, on average, 38.7% of families practiced handwashing with soap. A study conducted in 2014 indicated that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of 97%; the United States was about half with 77%; and China had the lowest rate of 23%. Currently, there are several methodologies for changing behaviour, to increase the adoption of the habit of washing hands with soap at critical times. Handwashing in groups of children at school at certain times of the day is an option in developing countries to incorporate handwash into the behavior of children.
The "Essential Health Care Program" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of tailored action to promote the health and education of children.
Disappear twice a year, in addition to washing your hands with soap every day, brushing your teeth daily with fluoride, are the basis of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of skin microorganisms improves by adding soap or detergents to the water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce barriers to the solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is ineffective to clean the skin because fats and proteins, which are components of organic matter, are not easily dissolved in the water.
However, a reasonable flow of water facilitates cleaning.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, may contain bacteria acquired in previous uses.
Some studies that analyzed the transfer of contaminated solid soap bacteria concluded that the transfer is unlikely, as bacteria are rinsed with foam.
Even so, the CDCs claim that "liquid soap is preferable with dispensation controls that do not involve using hands."
Antibacterial soaps have been intensively promoted for a health conscious public.
Currently, there is no evidence that using recommended disinfectants or antiseptics preserve organisms resistant to antibiotics by nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of strains of resistant organisms.
In this way, even if antibacterial soaps do not preserve strains resistant to antibiotics, they may not be as effective as they are promoted.
In addition to the surfactant and which protects the skin, sophisticated formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as well as pH regulator, benzoic acid with antimicrobial activity and more skin conditioners (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis of the School of Public Health at the University of Oregon indicated that common soaps are as effective as antibacterial soaps for the consumer that contain triclosan to prevent disease and remove bacteria from the hands.
The nice hot water to wash your hands is not enough to remove the bacteria.
Bacteria grow much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, warm soapy water is more effective than cold soapy water to eliminate natural oils that retain soil and bacteria.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using warm water has no effect on reducing the microbial burden on the hands.
A hand disinfectant or hand antiseptic is an agent without water for hand hygiene.
At the end of 1990 and in the first half of the twenty-first century, the agents for the hygiene of hands without water and with alcohol to rub (also known as alcohol-based solution for rubbing, antiseptic solution for hands to rub or disinfectants for hands) began to gain popularity.
Most are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated with a thick agent such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) in a gel, or a moisturizer like glycerin in a liquid, or foam for easy use and to reduce the effect of alcohol dryness.
Adding diluted hydrogen peroxide further increases antimicrobial activity. Hand disinfectants containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol remove germs effectively.
Alcohol-based disinfectants to flotate eliminate bacteria, multi-drug-resistant bacteria (SARM and ERV), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, VSR, rhinovirus, vaccination, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol-based disinfectants containing 70% alcohol remove 99.97% (decrease of 3.5 logarithms, similar to the reduction of 35 decibels) from bacteria in the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (reduction from 4 to 5 logarithms) from bacteria in the hands 1 minute after application. Hand disinfectants are more effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based disinfectants are virtually ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, the most common cause of contagious gastroenteritis. Enough solution should be used for antiseptic or alcohol-based hands to rub, such as to moisten or completely cover both hands.
The palm and back of both hands, between the fingers and the ends of all fingers are rubbed for approximately 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel are dried.
The fingertips should also be washed well, rubbing them on both palms. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend handwashing before hand disinfectants to rub, especially when hands are visibly dirty.
The increase in the use of these agents is based on their ease of use and on the rapid disposal of microorganisms; however, they should not be used as a replacement for the appropriate handwash unless water and soap are available.
Frequent use of disinfectants for alcohol-based hands may dry the skin unless emollients or moisturizers for the skin are added to the formula.
The effect of alcohol dryness can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based disinfectants that contain emollients caused significantly lower skin irritation and dryness than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic dermatitis by contact, contact urticaria syndrome or alcohol hypersensitivity or additives present in alcohol-based hand solutions for rubbing are very rare.
The lower tendency to cause contact irritating dermatitis was attractive compared to washing hands with water and soap.
Despite its effectiveness, waterless agents do not remove the organic matter from their hands, but simply disinfect them.
For this reason, hand disinfectants are not as effective as water and soap to prevent the spread of many pathogens, as pathogens remain in their hands.
The effectiveness of disinfectants for non-alcoholic hands largely depends on the ingredients and the formula, in addition historically, has been much lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based solutions for rubbing.
More recently, it has been found that formulas using benzalconium chloride have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose efficacy decreases after repeated use, probably due to progressive adverse skin reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot buy soap and use ashes or land instead.
Ashes or soil can be more effective than water alone, but less effective than soap.
One concern is that, if soil or ash are contaminated with microorganisms, this may increase the spread of disease rather than decrease it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant agent, since, in contact with water, forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommended that ash or sand be used as an alternative to soap when soap is not available.
The correct hand washing technique recommended by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prevent disease transmission includes the following steps:
Wet your hands with warm or cold running water.
Current water is recommended because containers with stagnant water can be contaminated, while the water temperature seems to make no difference.
Fleet your hands to form foam with a generous amount of soap, including the backs of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails.
The soap removes germs from the skin, and studies indicate that people often wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap than when using water alone.
Defer for at least 20 seconds.
Restricting creates friction, which helps eliminate germs from the skin, and restricting for longer periods eliminates more germs.
Wash well with running water.
Diving in a container can again pollute your hands.
Dry with a clean towel or let dry in the air.
Wet and wet hands become more easily contaminated. The most frequently forgotten parts are thumb, wrist, finger and under fingernail areas
Artificial nails and enamel of peeled nails can house microorganisms.
Wetting lotion is often recommended to prevent hands from drying out; dry skin can cause skin damage that may increase the risk of transmission of infections.
Several economic options can be used to facilitate hand-washing when there is no running water or soap, such as pouring water from a hanging can or pumpkin with appropriate holes or using ash if necessary in developing countries. In situations where there is limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as "house crevices" and other economic options.
A homemade tap is a simple technology that consists of using a suspended rope jug and a lever powered with the foot to pour a small amount of water on the hands and a bar soap.
Effective drying of hands is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some debate about the most effective drying in public bathrooms.
More and more research indicates that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric hand dryers found in many bathrooms.
In 2008, the University of Westminster, London, conducted a study, sponsored by the European Tissue Symposium paper towels industry, to compare the levels of hygiene offered by paper towels, hot air dryers and more modern air jet hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands with the hot air dryer, it was found that the total amount of bacteria increased, on average, 194% in the finger buds and 254% in the palms.
Drying with the air jet dryer resulted in an average increase in the total amount of bacteria of 42% in the finger buds and 15% in the palms.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total amount of bacteria decreased, on average, 76% in the finger buds and 77% in the palms. Scientists also conducted tests to determine whether there was any possibility of cross-contamination of other bath users and the bathroom environment as a result of each type of drying method.
The air jet dryer, which blows air from the unit at speeds, is said to be 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), managed to blow the micro-organisms of the hands and the unit and, potentially, to contaminate other bathroom users and the bathroom environment at a distance of up to 2 m.
The use of a hot air hand dryer propagated the microorganisms up to 0.25 meters away from the dryer.
Paper towels did not show a significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Product und Umwelt, different hand drying methods were evaluated.
The following changes were observed in the count of bacteria after hand drying:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryers have been compared to drying paper towels.
Washing hands with disinfectant towels for hands is an alternative during trips, when you have no water or soap.
The alcohol-based hand disinfectant must contain at least 60 % alcohol.
Washing the hands of doctors became mandatory long after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) for disease prevention in a hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide comments to remind hospital staff members that wash their hands when they forget.
One study found a decrease in infection rates with its use.
The washing of the hands of doctors is done for at least 15 seconds, with plenty of water and soap or gel to form foam and restrict all parts of the hands.
Hands should be held together by interlacing their fingers.
If there are remains below the nails, a pig brush can be used to remove them.
Since germs can stay in the water in their hands, it is important to rinse them thoroughly and dry them with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the water (and open any exit door if necessary).
This prevents the hands from getting contaminated again by those surfaces.
The purpose of handwashing in the medical care environment is to eliminate pathogens ("germen") and avoid transmitting them.
According to the New England Journal of Medicine, the lack of handwashing continues to exist at unacceptable levels in most medical environments, where many doctors and nurses usually forget to wash their hands before touching patients and thus transmit microorganisms.
One study showed that the right hand washing and other simple procedures may reduce the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infections by 66 per cent. The World Health Organization has published a sheet demonstrating hand washing and standard hand rubbing in the health care sectors.
The preliminary version of the guide for the organization's hand hygiene can also be found on its website so that the public can comment.
Whitby and others carried out a relevant review.
Commercial devices may measure and verify the hygiene of the hands, if proof of compliance is required.
The World Health Organization has "Five moments" for handwashing:
after exposure to blood or body fluids
before aseptic work and
after caring for patients. The addition of antiseptic chemicals in soap (a "medicinal" or "antibacterial" soap) gives you the possibility of elimination of the hand washing agent.
This elimination may be necessary before surgery or in environments in which organisms resistant to antibiotics are very common. To wash your hands before surgery, you need to have a tap that can be opened and closed without touching your hands, a bit of chlorhexidine or iodine for washing, sterilized towels to dry your hands after washing, a sterilized brush to rub and another sterilized instrument to clean under the nails.
All jewels must be removed.
This procedure requires washing hands and forearms up to the elbow, in general, for 2 to 6 minutes.
It is not necessary to wash for a long time (10 minutes).
When rinsed, the water of the forearms should be prevented from returning to the hands.
After washing, the hands dry with a sterilized cloth and a surgical jacket is placed.
To reduce germ spread, it is better to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for hands before and after caring for sick people.
In order to control infections caused by staphylococcus in hospitals, it has been found that the greatest benefit of hand cleaning is in the first 20% of washing and that very little additional benefit is obtained when the frequency of hand hygiene increases by more than 35%.
Washing with common soap results in more than triple incidence of bacterial infections transmitted to food compared to washing with antibacterial soap. Comparing hand washing with an alcohol-based solution with hand washing with an antibacterial soap for an average time of 30 seconds in each case, it was observed that the alcohol-frozen reduced the contamination of bacteria by 26% more than the antibacterial soap.
However, water and soap are more effective in reducing the influenza A H1N1 virus and hard Clostridium spores than alcohol-based disinfectants. Interventions to improve hand hygiene in health care centres may include training staff on hand washing, increasing availability of disinfectant for alcohol-based hands and written and oral reminders to staff.
More research is needed on which of these interventions are the most effective in different health-care environments.
In developing countries, washing hands with soap is considered an economic and fundamental tool for achieving good health and even good food.
However, the lack of a reliable supply of water, soap or hand-washing facilities in households, schools and workplaces makes it a challenge to achieve universal hand-washing behaviors.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, there are very few taps to wash your hands close to public or private toilets, although there are economic options for building hand-washing stations.
However, low hand-washing rates can also be the result of deep-rooted habits and not lack of soap or water.
Promoting soap-based hand-washing can influence political decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of hand-washing and lead to a change in behaviour in the long-term population.
For this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation is necessary.
In a systematic review of 70 studies, it was observed that community approaches are effective for increasing hand-washing in the PRBMs, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. An example of promoting hand-washing in schools is UNICEF's three-star approach, which encourages schools to take simple and economical measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, including hygiene requirements.
When minimum standards are reached, schools can move from one to, finally, three stars.
The construction of hand-washing stations can be part of the hand-washing promotion campaigns that are being carried out to reduce diseases and infant mortality.
The World Handwashing Day is another example of a awareness campaign that seeks to achieve a change in behaviour. As a result of the 2019-2020 Coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF promoted the creation of an emoji for handwashing.
Few studies have considered the overall profitability of hand washing in developing countries in relation to avoided AVADs.
However, an analysis indicates that promoting handwashing with soap is considerably more effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of handwashing for human health, particularly for people in vulnerable circumstances, such as mothers who had just given birth or soldiers in hospitals, was recognized for the first time in the mid-20th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, English, the "founder of modern nursing".
At that time, most people still believed that infections were caused by unpleasant smells called miasmas.
In the 1980s, outbreaks of foodborne diseases and health-related infections led the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote hand hygiene more actively as an important way to prevent the spread of infections.
The swine flu outbreak in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 made many countries more aware of the importance of washing their hands with soap to protect themselves from these infectious diseases.
In Germany, for example, posters with "right hand washing techniques" were hung next to the washbasins of the public bathrooms and the bathrooms of the office and airport buildings.
The phrase "washing hands" is a statement of not wanting to take care of something or sharing the complicity of something.
Its origin is in Matthew’s Bible passage in which Pontius Pilate washed his hands before the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but it has become a much broader phrase of use in some English communities.
In Macbeth of Shakespeare, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands compulsively in an attempt to clear an imaginary stain, which represents her conscience of guilt over the crimes she had committed and which had led her husband to commit.
It has also been found that after remembering or reflecting on non-ethical actions, people tend to wash their hands more often than others and tend to value more elements for handwashing.
Moreover, those people who have allowed themselves to wash their hands after such reflection are less likely to engage in other compensatory "cleaning" actions, such as volunteering.
Religions recommend the washing of hands for hygienic and symbolic purposes. The washing of symbolic hands, with water, but without soap, is part of the washing of ritual hands in many religions, such as Bahaism, Hinduism, Tevilá and Netilat Yadayim in Judaism, the washing machine in Christianity and the Wudu in Islam. Religions also recommend the washing of hygienic hands, particularly after certain actions.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam force you to wash your hands after going to the bathroom.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam compels themselves to wash their hands before and after each meal.
Risk controls at the workplace before COVID-19
Risk controls at the workplace before COVID-19 refer to the application of hygiene and occupational safety methodologies in risk controls for the prevention of coronary artery disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Adequate workplace risk controls depend on the workplace and the workplace and are based on a risk assessment of the sources of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community and the risk factors of workers who may be prone to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), work at lower risk of exposure has minimal work contact with the public and colleagues, for which basic infection prevention measures are advised, including hand washing, the recommendation to workers to stay home if they are sick, respiratory hygiene standards and the maintenance of a routine of cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
Work at medium exposure risk includes those requiring frequent or close contact with people who are not known or suspected of having COVID-19, but who may be infected by the current Community transmission or international travel.
This includes workers who are in contact with the general public, such as in schools, working environments with a high concentration of people and some large retail environments.
Risk controls for this group, in addition to measures to prevent basic infections, include ventilation with high-efficiency air filters, protective covers and individual protective equipment available if there is a person with COVID-19.
OSHA considers that health care workers and funeral services, exposed to people who are known to or suspected of having COVID-19, have a high risk of exposure, which increases to very high if they perform procedures that can generate aerosols in people who are known or suspected of having COVID-19 or taking or handling samples of these people.
The appropriate risk controls for these workers include engineering controls, such as ventilation rooms with negative pressure, and personal protective equipment suitable for work activity.
The outbreaks of COVID-19 can have several consequences in the workplace.
Workers may miss work because they are ill, because they have to take care of others or because of fear of exposure.
Trade patterns may change, both in terms of which goods are requested and the means of acquisition of such goods (such as buying in hours that are not peak, by sending services to the home or by window from the car).
Finally, shipments of items from geographical areas seriously affected by COVID-19 could be interrupted. A plan for the preparation and response to infectious diseases can be used to guide preventive measures.
The plans address risk levels related to various workplaces and labour activities, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from domestic and community environments and risk factors of individual workers, such as age or chronic medical conditions.
They also describe the controls necessary to address those risks and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of outbreaks.
Infectious disease preparedness and response plans may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
The objectives of the response to an outbreak include reducing transmission between staff members, protecting those at increased risk of adverse health complications, maintaining commercial operations and minimizing adverse effects on other entities of their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community in which the company is located affects the measures taken.
The risk control hierarchy is a widely used framework for occupational hygiene and safety to classify risk controls according to their effectiveness.
If the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrations and, finally, individual protective equipment.
Engineering controls involve insulating employees from work-related dangers without resorting to the behaviour of workers and may be the most cost-effective solution to implement them.
Administrative controls are changes in labour policies or procedures requiring action from the worker or employer.
Individual protection teams are considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but may help prevent some exposures.
All types of individual protection equipment should be selected according to the hazard to the worker, be placed as appropriate (e.g. respirators), be used appropriately and systematically, frequently reviewed, received maintenance, replaced if necessary and eliminated, cleaned and stored or disposed of correctly so as not to pollute.
According to the U.S. Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA), work at lower risk of exposure has minimal work contact with the public and colleagues.
Basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include deep and frequent handwashing, recommendation to workers to stay at home if they are sick, respiratory hygiene rules that include covering when coughing and sneezing, provision of paper and containers for waste, preparation for telework or staggered shifts if necessary, deter workers from using other tools and equipment and maintaining a routine cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
The immediate identification and isolation of people who may be infected is a fundamental measure to protect workers, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory disease stay in their homes until they stop having fever, signs of fever and any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without taking medicines to relieve symptoms or reduce fever; that sick leave policies be flexible and allow employees to stay home to care for a sick relative, and that employees know these policies.
According to OSHA, work at medium exposure risk includes those requiring frequent or close contact at less than six feet (1,8 m) with people who are not known or suspected of having COVID-19, but who may have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to the community transmission of the moment around the location of the company, or because the person has recently made an international trip to a place with widespread transmission of COVID-19.
These include workers in contact with the general public, such as schools, working environments with a high concentration of people and some large retail environments. Engineering controls for this group and higher-risk groups include the installation of high-efficiency air filters, increased ventilation rates, installation of physical barriers such as transparent plastic protective blankets and the placement of a service window so that the customer can request from the car. Administrative controls for this group and higher-risk groups include recommending to sick workers who stay at home, replace the presence cages by virtual communications, establish staggered shifts, suspend trips that are not essential to the existing VOCID-19 outbreaks, develop emergency communications plans that include a forum to respond to workers' concerns, offer training and training to workers on individual risk factors, and conduct of prevention in relation to COVID-19.
Workers in this risk group should rarely use respirators.
If a person gets sick on a plane, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include separating the sick person from others at a distance of 6 feet, assigning a crew member to care for the sick person and offering a mask to the sick person or asking him to cover his or her mouth and nose with paper handkerchiefs when he or she coughs or sneezes.
The cabin crew shall use disposable surgical gloves to attend to a sick passenger or to touch body fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces and, perhaps, individual protective equipment if the sick passenger has fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in a bag for hazardous biological waste and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected subsequently. In the case of commercial navigation, such as cruises and other ships carrying passengers, risk controls include postponement of sick travel, self-insulation and immediately inform the medical centre on board if someone has a fever or other symptoms while on board.
The ideal is for medical control to be done in the cabin of the isolated person. In the case of schools and childcare centres, the CDC recommends the short-term closure to clean or disinfect if an infected person was in the school building, regardless of community transmission.
When community transmission is minimal or moderate, social distancing strategies can be implemented, such as canceling excursions, assemblies and other mass gatherings, such as physical or choir education classes or meals in the dining room, increasing the space between the desks, staging the arrival and departure times, limiting visits that are not essential and using a separate place for the health room for children with flu symptoms.
When there is a considerable transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, it may be considered to extend the cancellation of classes. For police personnel carrying out daily routine activities, the CDCs consider the immediate risk to health to be low.
Police officers are recommended to contact persons with confirmed diagnosis or suspicions of COVID-19 who follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including the use of personal protective equipment.
If there is close contact during a detention, workers shall clean and disinfect their working belt and their equipment with an aerosol or household cleaning towels before re-use and follow the standard operating procedure for the containment and disposal of personal protective equipment and the containment and washing of clothing.
OSHA considers that certain health workers and morgues are within high or very high exposure risk categories.
Among the high-risk exposure works are those of delivery workers, support, laboratory and medical transportation who are exposed to patients with confirmed diagnoses or suspected COVID-19.
These become very high exposure risk works if workers perform aerosol generation procedures in patients with confirmed diagnoses or suspected COVID-19 or if they take or manipulate samples of these patients.
Some aerosol generation procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, certain dental procedures and examinations or invasive sampling.
High exposure risk morgue works include those in which workers are involved in the preparation of the bodies of persons who had COVID-19 or who were suspected to have them at death; they become very high exposure risk if they perform autopsy. Additional engineering controls for these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19, even when they are performed aerosol generation procedures.
Specialized ventilation with negative pressure may be appropriate in some medical and morgue environments.
Samples should be manipulated using Biosafety Level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients entering separate into different waiting rooms depending on whether or not they are suspected of having COVID-19. In addition to other types of personal protective equipment, OSHA recommends the use of masks for those working up to 6 feet away from patients who have been infected or suspected of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 and those who perform aerosol generation procedures.
In the United States, N95 respirators should be used with a filter mask approved by NIOSH or higher in the context of a written integral respiratory program that includes testing of fit, training and medical examinations.
Other types of masks can provide greater protection and improve the comfort of the worker. WHO does not recommend the use of protective monkeys, since COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, not one transmitted by body fluids.
WHO only recommends the use of a surgical mask for the classification staff of incoming patients.
For those who take respiratory samples of patients with COVID-19, they are given attention or transported without performing aerosol generation procedures, WHO recommends the use of surgical mask, glasses or facial protector, jacket and gloves.
If an aerosol generation procedure is performed, the surgical mask should be replaced by an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Because the provision of personal protection equipment is insufficient, WHO recommends minimizing the need to use it, replacing it with telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, limiting entry permits to the room of a patient with COVID-19 only those involved in their direct care, using the same mask without removing it while giving attention to several patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordination of the supply chain of personal protection equipment and discouraging the use of masks by asymptomatic persons.

This month, we are in unique circumstances.
The COVID-19 epidemic highlights our global human interconnection and the responsibilities we have with each other.
The challenges it presents are unprecedented, but we know that our best response lies in the empathy, cooperation and global community building that form the core of this organization.
The comradeship and the concern we have seen among all our colleagues in email messages, calls and conversations is a great validation of how incredible are the people we are lucky to work with.
I couldn't feel greater gratitude and pride that all of you were my companions.
Last week, someone shared with me the appreciation I felt for our work.
They reminded me how important it is for the world to be able to go to Wikipedia at this time and the powerful symbol that is the fact that this critical resource remains online and available to all.
Your work makes this possible, whether by keeping the sites running, helping our colleagues receive their payment or by keeping our communities safe.
The world needs the information Wikipedia provides today more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do but the way we do it will have a profound effect on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and its role in this, starting next week, we will make some important adjustments to the way we work together.
Adjustments to our work and schedule
As Robyn mentioned earlier, team C met last night to talk about our approach and schedule for the next few days and months.
In that conversation, we considered what we thought would be an adequate response to what we are facing and what would be the best way to maintain the sustainability of the organization at this time.
To a greater extent, we wanted to eliminate stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to slow down, it's okay.
For all staff, contractors and contract workers:
our daily work expectations will be about 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week, until next warning.
We are not declaring a holiday; if you can work at a more normal schedule, this would be of great value to the mission.
However, the world is an unpredictable place today, and whether you have to care for your loved ones, shop or go to the doctor, our priority is their well-being.
We're not keeping track of your hours.
If you're sick, don't work.
Although it should not be necessary to say it, we say it.
It is not necessary to apply for sick leave or paid free time; just inform your manager and help your team review schedules and schedules to ensure that key areas of work are covered.
(If you receive a positive diagnosis of COVID-19, advise Bryan, T&C Operations, so that T&C can help with the support and make sure that management is aware of your situation).
People who work hourly will receive the full payment.
As we have said, we renew our commitment to our contractors and colleagues who work hourly.
All will be paid on the basis of their normal hours worked under normal circumstances.
This also applies if you are sick and cannot work.
If you want to work, you have our support.
Many people use work as a way to channel their stress with the world around us.
What we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in these times.
Again, it is your personal care.
What we ask you to do is to communicate with your manager so we know what to expect and we can adapt properly.
Certain work is considered essential.
There are some things we must continue to do.
The site reliability engineering, human resources operations, trust and security and fund-raising teams, among others, perform critical work that could require additional support.
We will begin a process with all departments to assess current objectives and change our approach to support what is essential to our mission.
There are enough tasks for all of us; the only difference is that we will all focus on the most essential projects.
Reduced speed today will not harm us tomorrow.
We don't plan to "double the hours to catch up" when the pandemic is over.
It will not be expected that he will work overtime to meet deadlines that are no longer realistic.
We accept that circumstances have changed and we will work to establish new objectives and deadlines when appropriate.
What about the APP, or Annual Planning?
To adjust to our new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we plan to adjust the schedule for the delivery of our 2020-2021 Annual Planning.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan that assigns more time to the budget so that employees can prioritize critical work, personal care and care of loved ones while adapting to the needs of those who need or want to work with a reduced schedule during the coming weeks.
This extension of our schedule greatly reduces current planning and pressure loads throughout the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and inform delegates and teams about the next steps we have just got confirmation.
Thanks to the APP team for their leadership in this situation.
Status, exhibition and cleaning of the office
Last week we learned that one of our colleagues in the San Francisco office might have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, as a precautionary measure, we hired an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces of the San Francisco office.
They used a hospitally used antiviral solution to disinfect all surfaces, in addition to the reception and elevators that go to our floor.
The building has adopted its own care duty protocol, using products that support the safety of its occupants.
We are confident that the office will be well prepared for when we decide to return.
Our office in DC is located in a WeWork, which has shared its protocol for COVID-19 with us and all staff members in DC offices.
Since last week, our DC office has moved its operations to a completely remote environment in accordance with the guidelines shared with San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York City already know, we have also talked about renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions are still ongoing, but it is possible that they will continue.
Some of our colleagues work remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who have already worked remotely since before know that this modality requires adaptation, so they offer the following suggestions:
Limits the duration of meetings at intervals of up to one or two hours.
If longer sessions are required, consider how to section them over several days.
Define the meeting clearly with a list of topics and send the reading materials in advance.
Adopt the use of video by default, using tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and live connection.
Design a leader to moderate each meeting, a person who controls the questions in the chat and the list of speakers, and someone who helps take notes (or take notes collaboratively).
Send an email to technical support if you need comfortable headphones.
Use the welfare refund for refreshments.
Join the #remote channel in Slack to talk to your colleagues about distributed work
The HR Operations team is analysing the guidelines on ergonomics based on web seminars to support the increase in work distributed throughout the Foundation.
Last week we asked all beneficiaries of Community grants to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as publishers, until WHO declared the end of the pandemic.
We informed them that we understood that our request for cancellations and other restrictions might make it impossible to comply with their share of the activities agreed for the grant and that there would be no penalty for delaying or modifying those objectives.
This next week we will follow up with additional guidelines in Wikimania and other community and regional thematic conferences.
The overall feeling of the community at the global level seems to be, in part, sadness over the interruption and, in part, relief from the clarity and ability to focus on their own communities, both Wikimedia and others.
Next, CRT will be working to set up a page on Meta-Wiki in order to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and follow our communications with them.
Keep in touch with COVID-19 issues
We will send you an invitation through your calendars for next Thursday, 14:00 h, coordinated universal time/07:00 h, Pacific time, for a special staff meeting.
We will take advantage of this opportunity to share additional news, answer your questions and spend time connecting each other.
We're together in this and we're available to help as we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to find the information of this email message and all the additional essential information related to COVID-19 in Office Wiki.
CRT will keep these pages up-to-date and all information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communications with staff residing in countries currently heavily affected.
If you have any questions about travel, events, an important workflow, some coverage problem or anything you might need help with, do not hesitate to notify CRT and work with them.
We are here to help provide support and function as a link when necessary.
If they have confidential or sensitive matters, send an e-mail to Bryan Judah, Director of International Global Operations of RR. HH.
None of these changes should be considered a abandonment of our work and our obligations.
Instead, they are a recognition that at this point our work and our obligations should probably be adapted in a way that had not happened before.
These are the measures we believe necessary to support each other so that we can continue to work, give our movement the necessary support and provide the world with the service in which it trusts.
Our planned work will be there for us when the time comes.
For now, it is time to support each other and make way for the important work that will come in the coming weeks and possibly in the coming months.
We need all of you to make this possible and, therefore, we need to take care of and care for your families so that they can find themselves in the best possible condition when the need arises.
Now, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S) and the rest of the leaderazgo team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
Angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ECA2) is an enzyme that adheres to the outer surface (cell membranes) of the cells of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ECA2 counteracts the activity of the related angiotensin converting enzyme (ECA) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing angiotensin (1-7), which makes it a therapeutic target for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ECA2 also serves as a point of entry to cells for some coronary virus.
The human version of the enzyme is generally called hECA2.
The angiotensin 2 converting enzyme is a metaloenzyme containing zinc and is found on the surface of endothelial cells and other types.
The ECA2 protein contains an N-terminal domain of peptide M2 and a C-terminal domain renal transporter of collectin amino acids.
ECA2 is a single type I membrane protein, with its enzymaticly active domain exposed to the surface of the cells of the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ECA2 is dissolved from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as shedasa and, as a result, the soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and ultimately excreted through the urine.
ECA2 is present in most organs: ECA2 is mainly attached to the cell membrane of type II alveolar cells of the lungs, small intestine enterocytes, arterial and venous endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells of most organs.
The expression of mARN of ECA2 is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brain stem.
The main function of ECA2 is to counteract the ECA.
The ACE causes the hormone of angiotensin I and forms angiotensin II, which is vasoconstrictor.
In turn, ECA2 narrows the carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine of angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it to form angiotensin vasodilator (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ECA2 may also separate several other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradiquinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphine A and greline.
ECA2 also regulates the trafficking of membranes of the SLC6A19 neutral amino acid transporter and has been associated with Hartnup disease.
As a transmembranal protein, ECA2 serves as the main entry point for some coronary artery viruses, including HCOV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus causing SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus causing COVID-19).
More specifically, the combination of the S1 strain protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 with the enzyme domain of ECA2 on the surface of the cells results in endocytosis and transfer of the virus along with the enzyme to the endosomas within the cells.
This entry process also requires the preparation of S protein by the host's TMPRSS2 protease serum, the inhibition of which is currently being investigated as possible therapy. This has led to certain assumptions that reducing ECA2 levels in cells could help fight infection.
However, various professional associations and regulators have recommended to continue the standard ECA and BRA inhibitory therapy.
A systematic metaanalysis review published on 11 July 2012 determined that "the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant reduction of 34% of the risk of pneumonia compared to control cases".
Moreover, "the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients receiving treatment with ACE inhibitors and who had a higher risk of pneumonia, particularly those with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were not so solid for the overall risk of pneumonia."
Recombinant human ECA2 (rhECA2) appears to be a new therapy for acute lung injury and appears to improve pulmonary haemodynamics and oxygen saturation in lachones with acute respiratory difficulty syndrome induced by lipopolisaccharides.
The mean life of rhECA2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the start of the action is 30 minutes in addition to the 24 hour duration of the effect.
Several findings suggest that rhECA2 could be a promising medicine for those with intolerance to classical inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases in which circulating angiotensin II is elevated. Infusion of rhECA2 was evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory difficulty syndrome.
The applications of the COVID-19 are software applications for mobile devices designed to help with tracking contacts in response to the 2019-2020 Coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying people ("contacts") that might have been in contact with a infected person.
Various applications were developed or proposed with official government support in some territories and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks have been developed for the creation of contact tracking applications.
Privacy concerns have been raised, in particular, in relation to systems based on tracking the geographical location of users of the application.
There are other less invasive alternatives, such as using Bluetooth signals to record the proximity of one user to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Apple and Google jointly announced that they would integrate functionality to admit these Bluetooth-based applications directly into their iOS and Android operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, together with Alipay, has implemented an application that allows citizens to verify whether they have been in contact with people who have COVID-19.
It is already in use in over 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore an app called TraceTogether is being used.
The app was developed by a local IT community, launched as an open source application and will be handed over to the government. In North Macedonia, "StopKorona!" was launched, a Bluetooth-based application to track exposure to potentially infected people and provide a quick response to health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting the approval of Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government reported that the application of contact tracking was at an advanced stage of development and would be available for implementation in the coming weeks. It is planned to use a similar application in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on the TraceTogether application and the BlueTrace protocol of Singapore. Russia plans to introduce a geo-perimeter application for patients living in Moscow who have received a diagnosis of COVID-19, designed to ensure that they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, professor of Security Engineering at Cambridge University, presented several potential practical problems with application-based systems, including false positives and the possible lack of effectiveness if the adoption of the application is limited to only a small part of the population.
In response to concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful "coronavirus" applications, Apple limited the types of organizations that can add coronavirus-related applications in its App Store to "official" or trusted organizations only.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy defenders expressed concern about the consequences of massive surveillance through coronavirus applications and, in particular, whether the infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be dismantled once the threat has passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations submitted a communiqué to require limits to this type of monitoring.
The organizations established eight conditions for government projects:
monitoring should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
the expansion of monitoring and monitoring should have extinguishing clauses;
the use of data should be limited to objectives related to COVID-19;
security and anonymity should be protected and there should be evidence of such protection;
digital surveillance should avoid exacerbate discrimination and marginalization;
any exchange of data with third parties should be defined in the laws;
protection against abuse should be implemented and citizens' rights established to respond to such abuse;
significant participation of all "relevant stakeholders", including public health experts and marginalized groups, will be mandatory. Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ifne Grenzen, RSF) in Germany also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to address the problem of persistent surveillance by removing the tracking mechanism from its operating systems when no longer required.
In some countries, a network-based location tracking was used instead of applications, which eliminated both the need to download an application and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to gross location data present significant potential privacy problems.
However, it is not necessary for all systems with central servers to have access to personal location data; several privacy protection systems have been created using central servers only for intercommunication (see next section).
In South Korea, a system was used that is not based on an application to carry out the tracking of contacts.
Instead of using a specific application, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and credit card transaction data, and combined them to generate warnings through text messages for potentially infected persons.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government has also made location information available to the public, something that is permitted due to wide-ranging changes to the privacy laws of information after the outbreak of MERS in that country.
This information is available to the public through various applications and websites. Some countries, including Germany, considered using centralized and privacy protection systems.
As of 6 April 2020, details have not yet been published.
The tracking of contacts with privacy protection is a well-established concept, with a large amount of published research dating back at least to 2013. As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as the use of low-energy Bluetooth (BLE) to record a user's proximity to other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort that contains both centralized and decentralized approaches and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized proximity tracking to preserve privacy (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, previously known as contact event numbers, CEN) and protocols and mechanisms for mobile contact tracking for privacy protection (PACT), among others.
In these protocols, personal identification data never come out of the device and all matching occurs on the device.
The MIT Media Lab Privacy Group has been developing SafePaths, a platform for the use of techniques that protect privacy by collecting and using location data or route intersections to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on the research of the technical report "Out-of-control Applications: How to Maintain Personal Privacy During an Epidemic", published in March 2020. Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform of Enigma MPC, a company that develops privacy technologies that was also originally founded at the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies that allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials, without compromising the privacy of such data.
On 5 April 2020, several groups united around what was essentially the same approach and with highly matching protocols formed the Global TCN Coalition with the aim of reducing fragmentation and allowing global interoperability of tracking and alert applications, a key aspect for achieving broad adoption.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had opened the BlueTrace protocol code used by its official government application.
On April 10, 2020, Apple and Google, the companies that control iOS and Android mobile platforms, announced an initiative for tracking contacts that they assured would protect privacy, which is based on the combination of low-energy Bluetooth technology and privacy protection encryption.
They also published the specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, it is intended to implement the system in three stages:
implementation of tools for governments to create official coronavirus tracking applications that protect privacy
integration of this functionality directly into iOS and Android. Google and Apple plan to address adoption and persistent monitoring problems by first distributing the system through OS updates and then removing them in the same way once the threat has passed.
b'Reperfilation (also known as repositioning or therapeutic change) is the rehabilitation of an approved drug for the treatment of a disease that is not the one for which it was originally developed.
This is in line with the scientific research currently seeking to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research lines include the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 and convalescent plasma transfusion. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 chemomodulable proteins, each of which has multiple binding sites.
The analysis of these binding sites provides a reasonable basis for the project to develop an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important daily proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are papaine-like protease, RNA polymerase directed by RNA, helicase, protein S and ribophosphatase ADP.
Hussein A. A. et al. studied several medical-interest compounds that then optimized and analyzed to identify the similarity of their main chain with the most similar approved drugs in order to accelerate the development of a potent drug against SARS-CoV-2 in their preclinical study and recommend it for the design of a clinical study.
Chloroquin is an antimalarial drug that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs to be studied in the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York State trials with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on 24 March. On 28 March, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulphate and chloroquine phosphate by means of an urgent authorisation (USA).
Treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorised according to an US only as an experimental treatment for urgent use in patients who are hospitalized but cannot receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDCs said that "the use, dose or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2" infection are not yet established.
The doctors have said they use the drug when "there is no other option."
A Turkish research team in Istanbul conducts a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Large studies are underway at Duke University and Oxford University.
The NYU College of Medicine of Langone is conducting a trial on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed to prove that favipiravir was "clearly effective."
Thirty-five patients in Shenzhen gave negative in an average of 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study in Wuhan in 240 patients with pneumonia, half received favipiravir, while the other half was given umifenovir.
The Italian Medicines Agency reminded the public that the existing evidence supporting the drug is scarce and preliminary.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would buy the drug from Japan for its reservations and that it would use the military to deliver the drug to university hospitals, where it would be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has made proposals to the Trump Administration on drug purchase. The drug may be less effective in serious cases of the disease if the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or who try to conceive.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir antivirals, concluded that "no benefits were observed".
The drugs were designed to inhibit HIV replication by joining the protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drugs to find a compound that joins the SARS-CoV-2 protease. In the scientific community, criticism has emerged about the allocation of resources to the rehabilitation of drugs specifically developed for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international study Solidarity.
Redesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences later discovered that redesivir had in vitro antiviral activity against multiple phyloviruses, neumoviruses, paramixoviruses, and coronaviruses.
One problem of antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can result in a more serious disease and transmission.
Some initial studies prior to the trials suggest that redesivir may have a high genetic barrier against resistance. Several clinical trials are ongoing, including two conducted by hospitals at the University of Cleveland; one for people with a moderate disease and one for those with a more serious disease.
There are three clinical trials of intravenous vitamin C for people hospitalized and severely affected by COVID-19; two controlled with placebo (China, Canada) and one with no control (Italy).
New York State began trials with azithromycin antibiotic on March 24, 2020.
Japan's National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning a clinical trial with Teijin's Alvesco (cyclesonide), an inhalable corticosteroid for asthma, as treatment for asymptomatic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
A form of angiotensin 2 converting enzyme, a phase II trial is ongoing and 200 severe patients hospitalized in Denmark, Germany and Austria will be enrolled to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicin in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms.
The study, called COLCORONA, is enrolled in 6,000 adults aged 40 years and older with a diagnosis of COVID-19 and mild symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Pregnant women who breastfeed or do not have an emotional contraceptive method are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being evaluated in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, so the Italian Medicines Agency published guidelines on their use.
On April 14, a multicenter study was announced in Italy with 300 patients investigating the use of sodium enoxaparin in preventive and therapeutic doses.
As SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, scientists are paying a lot of attention to the rehabilitation of antiviral drugs that developed for previous outbreaks of the SROM virus, SARG and the West Nile.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: umifenovir is recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
These are some treatments that were identified for possible readaptations for the treatment of COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (blocks IL-6 receptor): approved by China.

b'A vaccine against COVID-19 is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, there are many ongoing attempts to develop this vaccine.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing the disease in less than 18 months.
In April, five possible vaccines were in phase I safety studies.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak was spread around the world in 2020, triggering considerable investments and research to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use the genomes published to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
Established in April, the requirements of the CEPI initiative for the development of a vaccine are speed, manufacturing capacity, scale implementation and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were being investigated and developed in early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The following are included among the dianas of the main platforms that went into phase I safety studies:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (phase I developer and possible vaccine: Modern, mRNA-1273)
virus vector (phase I developer and possible vaccine: CanSino Biologicals, adenovirus vector type 5)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, 115 potential vaccines are in the early stages of development, 78 of which are confirmed in active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute) and the other 37 are announced, but with little information available (it is assumed to be planning or developing).
A Phase I or II trial performs preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests, usually random, placebo-controlled, and is performed in several sites, while determining more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including a control group, and assess the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent the disease, while controlling the adverse effects that occur with the optimal dose.
Of the 79 active developing vaccines (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 were not yet in human assessment (continued in the "preclinical" research).
About 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was investigating the potential of a molecular-subjected vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate immune reactions.
About 24 January 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) of the University of Saskatchewan announced the start of work in a vaccine and expects human testing to begin in 2021.
Vaccines development projects were announced at the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention in China on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
About 29 January 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that they had begun to develop a vaccine.
Janssen is co-scrolling an oral vaccine with his biotech associate, Vaxart.
On 18 March 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing association with Vaxart for the development of the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a document with a design for a vaccine with similar technology that is used in the treatment of neoantigenic cancer vaccines.
On 25 March, the head of the research institute announced that they had completed the synthesis of the vaccine and that the tests were beginning.
On 27 February 2020, a subsidiary of Generex, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that a project was being launched to create a peptide vaccine li-key against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a possible vaccine that could be tested in humans "within 90 days".
On March 5, 2020, the University of Washington in San Luis announced its projects to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command at Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research at Silver Spring, both in western Maryland, announced that they were working on a vaccine.
About March 10, 2020, Emergent Bioslutions announced that it had joined Novavax Inc.
in the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
Partners also announced plans for a clinical trial and a phase I clinical trial by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that it was working with 11 isolates and that, although moving fast, it would take at least a year and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported the development of a coronavirus-like particle with partial funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
The possible vaccine is at the laboratory research stage and human testing is expected to begin in July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that U.S. President Donald Trump had offered CureVac "'large amounts of money for exclusive access to a vaccine against COVID-19', to which the German government complained.
On 17 March 2020, the U.S. pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced an association with the German company BioNTech to jointly develop a vaccine based on RNAm.
The possible BNT162 RNA-based vaccine is currently in preclinical testing and clinical trials are expected to start in April 2020.
In Italy, on 17 March 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it will have the results of the preclinical tests in April 2020 and that the human trials of the possible final vaccine could begin in the fall.
In France, on 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Innovations in Epidemic Preparation (CEPI) announced an investment of USD 4.9 million in a research alliance of a vaccine against COVID-19 that includes the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, leading to the total investment of CEPI in the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 to USD 29 million.
The other ECI partners for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University and Queensland University.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officers announced that scientists began testing in animals of six possible vaccines.
Researchers at the Imperial College of London announced on 20 March 2020 that they were developing an RNA vaccine with self-replication against COVID-19.
The possible vaccine was developed within 14 days of receiving the Chinese sequence.
At the end of March, the Canadian Government announced CAD funding 275 million for 96 medical action research projects to counter COVID-19, which includes a large number of possible vaccines in Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago initiatives and the University of Saskatchewan.
At the same time, the Canadian Government announced the use of CAD 192 million specifically to develop a vaccine against COVID-19, with plans to create a "national vaccine bank" with several new vaccines that could be used if another outbreak of coronavirus occurs.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the Faculty of Medicine at Pittsburgh University announced the PittCoVacc tests, a possible vaccine against COVID-19, in mice and said that "the S1 subunit vaccines administered by MNA administered by SARS-CoV-2 obtained powerful responses from the specific antibodies of antigens (in mice) that were evident two weeks after vaccination".
In Canada, on April 16, 2020, the Faculty of Pharmacy at Waterloo University announced the design of a possible DNA-based vaccine as a probable nasal sprayer.
Using bacteria, DNA will be designated to replicate within human bacteria and produce harmless virus-like particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, the industrial sector and three U.S. universities gathered resources to access IBM supercomputers, along with computing resources in the cloud of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have non-specific effects.
That means they can have benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
Another randomized essay in Australia seeks to register 4170 health workers.
Vaccines that are being developed may not be safe or effective.
Initial investigations to assess the effectiveness of vaccines with specific animal models of COVID-19, such as the transgenic mouse expressed by ECA2, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, show the need for level 3 biosafety containment measures for the handling of live viruses and with international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARG and MROM have been tested in non-human animal models.
By 2020, there is no cure or vaccine that protects against SARG that has proved to be safe and effective in humans.
According to research publications from 2005 to 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicines to treat SARG was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. There is also no confirmed vaccine against MROM.
When the MROM was generalized, it was believed that existing SARG research could be a useful template for developing vaccines and treatments against MERS-CoV infection.
In March 2020, one SROM vaccine (based on DNA) completed phase I clinical trials in humans, another three were ongoing, all of which were viral vector vaccines, two adenoviric vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA vector vaccine (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media publications promoted a conspiracy theory that the virus causing COVID-19 was known and already had a vaccine.
Patents cited by various social media publications refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of coronavirus, such as the coronavirus of SARG.
b'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, sore throat, loss of the smell, and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but may vary between two and fourteen days.
While most cases result in mild symptoms, some progress in viral pneumonia and multiorganic insufficiency.
As at 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases were reported in 210 countries and territories, with more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568 000 people have recovered. The virus spreads mainly among people during close contact, usually through droplets that occur by coughing, sneezing or talking.
While these droplets occur when exhaled, they usually fall to the floor or on the surfaces, instead of being contagious in long distances.
People can also become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive on the surfaces up to 72 hours.
It is more contagious during the first three days after onset of symptoms, although propagation is also possible before symptoms occur and in late stages of the disease. The standard method for diagnosis is the chain reaction of polymerase with real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR) of a nasopharyngeal hisopate.
The use of masks is recommended for those who suspect that they have the virus and its caregivers.
Recommendations on the use of masks for the general public vary. Some authorities recommend not to use masks, others recommend that masks be used, while others require their use.
There is currently no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment against COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries in the six regions of WHO.
Those who are infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or have symptoms similar to those of the flu, such as fever, cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, pain or persistent pressure in the chest, confusion, difficulty walking and blue face or lips. If these symptoms occur, it is recommended to seek immediate medical attention.
It is less common to observe symptoms in the upper airways, such as sneezing, nasal drip and sore throat.
Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, have been identified in varying percentages.
Some cases in China initially presented chest oppression and palpitations.
In some, the disease progressed to pneumonia, multiorganic insufficiency and death.
This is called incubation period.
The incubation period of COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but may vary from two to fourteen days.
97.5% of people with symptoms do so within 11.5 days of infection. According to reports, not all infected people have symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers is not yet fully known; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they can contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected people who do not have symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied. Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20% of confirmed cases were asymptomatic during hospitalization.
The National Health Commission of China began to include asymptomatic cases in daily cases on 1 April. Of the 166 infections of that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic when the test was carried out.
Both sputum and saliva can have large viral loads.
Speaking out loud releases more drops than when speaking with a normal volume.
A study in Singapore found that not covering the mouth by coughing can cause droplets to travel 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not usually airborne, the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that transmission through biological aerosols is possible and explained that air collectors in the hallway outside the dormitories of people gave positive in viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (PRC) may lead to aerosolization of respiratory secretions and consequently air transmission.
While there are concerns about the possibility of spreading through faeces, the risk is thought to be low. The virus is more contagious when people have symptoms; although propagation is possible before symptoms start, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) explains that although it is not entirely clear how easy it is to spread, a person usually infects two or three more. The virus survives hours or days on the surfaces.
Specifically, the virus was detected for one day in the carton, up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours in products with 99% copper.
However, this varies according to humidity and temperature.
soap and detergent are also effective if used correctly. soap products degrade the protective lipid layer of the virus and disable it, as well as remove it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorohexidine glucanate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken an average of two days after the start of hospitalization.
In five out of six patients, the first sample had the highest viral load. In the case of the sixth patient, the highest viral load was observed on the second day of test.
The coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected with a group of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in related coronaviruses.
Outside the human body, the domestic soap kills the virus, as it revives its protective bubble. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most affected organs by COVID-19 because the virus enters host cells through the converting enzyme of type 2 angiotensin I (ECA2), which is more abundant in type II alveolar cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called "spicula" (peplomer) to connect with ECA2 and enter the host cell.
In 12% of people hospitalized in Wuhan, China, acute heart injury was identified, which is more common in the serious disease.
Cardiovascular symptoms rates are high due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, but acute myocardial injury may be related to ECA2 receptors in the heart.
ECA2 receptors have a high expression in the heart and participate in its operation.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was detected in patients in the ICU with COVID-19 virus infections and may be related to poor prognosis. In autopsyes of people who died by COVID-19, diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrates with lymphocytes in the lungs were detected.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropism for epithelial cells that express ECA2 of the airways, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, it was observed that the secretive T lymphocytes of GM-CSF pathogens correlate with the recruitment of secretive IL-6 monocytes and a severe pulmonary pathology in patients with COVID-19.
In the autopsy, lymphocyte infiltrates were also reported.
WHO has published several test protocols to detect the disease.
The standard test method is the chain reaction of polymerase with real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually performed in samples of the airways obtained through a nasopharyngeal hisopate; however, samples of nasal or sputum hisopates can also be used.
The results are usually available within a few hours or two days.
Blood tests may also be used, but two blood samples should be taken with two weeks of difference and the results have very little immediate value.
Chinese scientists managed to isolate the strain of the coronavirus and published the genetic sequence so that the world's laboratories could independently develop polymerase chain reaction tests (PCR) to detect virus infection.
As of April 4, 2020, antibody tests (which can detect active infections and if the person was infected in the past) were being developed, but were not widely used.
Experience in China with the evidence has shown that accuracy is only 60 to 70%.
The FDA in the United States approved the first immediate diagnostic test on March 21, 2020 to use it at the end of that month. The diagnostic guidelines published by the Zhongnan Hospital at Wuhan University suggested methods to detect infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral multilobular emerald glass opacitys with peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution are common in the initial stages of infection.
As the disease progresses, subpleural domain may appear, pattern in disordered footing (lobulillar septal enlargement with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation.
Few data are available on microscopic lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological results of autopsy are as follows:
Macroscopy: pleuritis, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary oedema
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumonia, atypically large pneumonia, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and the formation of giant cells with multiple nuclei
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffused alveolar exuds.
DAD is a cause of acute respiratory difficulty syndrome (ASD) and severe hypoxemia.
pneumonia in curation: organization of exudates in alveolar cavity and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: diffused intravascular coagulation (IDC); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the possibility of infection include staying at home, avoiding places with many people, washing your hands with water and soap often for at least 20 seconds, having good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth without washing your hands.
The CDCs recommend covering their mouth and nose with a handkerchief when coughing or sneezing and, if they do not have handkerchiefs, use the inner part of the elbow.
Appropriate hand hygiene is recommended after coughing or sneezing.
The CDCs have recommended the use of screen taps in public places, one of the reasons is to limit transmission by asymptomatic people. Social distancing strategies seek to reduce contact of people infected with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and canceling public gatherings.
Distance patterns also indicate that people must maintain a distance of 6 feet (1.8 m).
There is no effective medicine to prevent COVID-19. As it is not expected that there will be a vaccine until 2021, as very soon, a key part to control COVID-19 is to try to prevent the epidemic peak, which is known as "squeezing the curve".
CDCs also recommend washing their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or when the hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after ringing the nose, coughing or sneezing.
They also recommend the use of an alcohol-based disinfectant with a minimum of 60% alcohol, but only when there is no water and soap available in a timely manner. For areas where hand disinfectants are not easy to achieve, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, antimicrobial activity results from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; "it is not an active substance for hand antisepsis."
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
Patients are given supportive care, which may include rehydration, oxygen therapy and treatment for other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that those who suspect that they have the virus wear a simple mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (OCEC) has been used to address the problem of respiratory failure, but the benefits are still being analyzed.
To improve immunity, personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet have been recommended.
Support treatments can be useful for those with mild symptoms at the initial stage of infection. WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for the care of people hospitalized with COVID-19.
Intensivists and pneumologists in the United States compiled the recommendations of several agencies in a free resource, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For the initial treatment of symptoms, some medical professionals recommend simatamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen.
Caution should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in health care environments when procedures are carried out that can generate aerosols, such as intubation or manual ventilation.
The CDC recommends that health care professionals care for people with COVID-19 place the patient in an air infection isolation zone (AIIR), as well as use standard precautions, contact precautions and precautions to avoid air transmission. The CDC highlights guidelines for the use of personal protection equipment (EPP) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment are EPP jacket, mask, protective glasses and medical gloves. When available, the respirators are preferred (instead of masks).
The N95 masks are approved for industrial environments, but the FDA authorised their use by means of an urgent authorisation for use (USA).
They are designed to protect against particles that are in the air, such as dust, but are not guaranteed effectiveness against a specific biological agent that is not specified in the product indications.
When no masks are available, the CDC recommends the use of protective covers or, as a last resort, home masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not serious enough to require mechanical ventilation or alternatives, but a percentage of cases are.
This type of respiratory support is being actively studied for people hospitalized with respiratory failure related to COVIDA-19 and there is already some evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high flow nasal cannull or positive bipression in the airways.
It is not yet known whether either of these two offers the same benefit to people in critical condition.
Some doctors prefer to use invasive mechanical ventilation when it is available because this technique limits the propagation of aerosol particles compared to the high flow nasal cannull. Serious cases occur mainly in adults older than 60 years of age and in particular those over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have enough head beds in hospitals, which limits the capacity of the health system to handle the sudden increase in severe cases of COVID-19 requiring hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% was admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support and 1.4% died.
In China, approximately 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are finally transferred to the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex when a patient with COVID-19 has acute respiratory difficulty syndrome (RASD) and oxygenation is increasingly difficult.
Respirators that have different modes of pressure control and PPTE are needed to maximize oxygen supply, while minimizing the risk of lung injury associated with the respirator and pneumothorax.
Older respirators may not have high PPTE.
Research on possible treatments began in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Redesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although the development of new medicines may take up to 2021, several medicines that are being tested are already approved for other uses or are under advanced testing.
Antiviral medicines can be tested in people with severe disease.
WHO recommends that volunteers participate in efficacy and safety testing of possible treatments. The FDA granted temporary consent to the convalescent plasma as experimental treatment in cases where the life of the person is at serious and immediate risk.
It has not been submitted to the clinical studies necessary to demonstrate whether it is safe and effective for a disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the outbreak of the disease.
Users must enter their name and identification number.
The application can detect the "close contact" and therefore a potential risk of infection through surveillance data.
Each user can also control the status of three other users.
If a possible risk is detected, the application not only recommends self-confining, but also alerts local health officers. Analysis of cell information macro data, facial recognition technology, cell phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to track infected persons and those with whom they were in contact in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli Government allowed security agencies to track data from mobile phones of persons suspected of having coronavirus.
The measure was taken to strengthen quarantine and protect those who can contact infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared the summary data of the location of the telephones with the German federal government agency, Robert Koch Institute, in order to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia implemented facial recognition technology to detect quarantine breaches.
Regional Health Commissioner Giulio Gallera said mobile telephony operators have informed him that "40% of people still move anyway."
The German Government carried out a 48-hour weekend hack with more than 42,000 participants.
In addition, Estonia's president, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a global request for creative solutions against the spread of the coronavirus.
People may experience anxiety over quarantine, travel restrictions and side effects of treatment or fear of infection in themselves.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor: "The growing social isolation, loneliness, anxiety about health, stress and economic problems are a perfect storm for people's mental health and well-being."
The disease may follow a mild evolution with few or no symptoms, so it will appear to other diseases of the upper airways, such as the common cold.
Mild cases are usually recovered within two weeks, while serious or critical cases may take from three to six weeks to do so.
Pregnant women may be at risk of serious infection by the COVID-19 virus, according to data from other similar viruses, such as the SARG and SROM virus, but the COVID-19 data are insufficient. In some people, COVID-19 may affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
In the most serious cases, COVID-19 can rapidly progress to the respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) which causes respiratory failure, septic shock and multiorganic insufficiency.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, clotting disorder and cardiac, renal and hepatic damage.
The alteration of coagulation, specifically the increase in protobin time, has been reported in 6% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19; whereas renal function impairment is observed in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20 to 30% of people with CODIV-19 have high liver enzymes (aminotransferases).
According to the same report, the average time between onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five days of hospitalization.
However, for patients transferred to the ICU, an average of seven days passed between hospitalization and death.
In an early case study, the mean time from the onset of symptoms to death was 14 days, with a complete interval of 6 to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) in China, the mortality rate among males was 2.8% and among women was 1.7%.
Histopathological examinations of postmortem samples of the lungs show diffuse alveolar damage with exuded cellular fibromyxoids in both lungs.
Viric cytopathic changes were observed in the pneumonias.
The image of the lungs was similar to the acute respiratory difficulty syndrome (ASD).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, heart damage resulted from high levels of troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to data from the United States of America, 89 per cent of hospitalized persons had a pre-existing condition. The availability of medical resources and socio-economic aspects of a region may also affect mortality.
Estimates of disease mortality vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
Insufficient accounts of mild cases may cause the mortality rate to be overestimated.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of past cases may indicate that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 and approximately 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die compared to non-smokers. They worry about the long-term sequelae of this disease.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a 20 to 30 per cent reduction in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and the images of the lungs suggest organ involvement.
This may also cause the syndrome post intensive care after recovery.
In March 2020, it was unknown whether previous infections generated effective long-term immunity in people who recovered from the disease.
It seems that immunity is possible, based on the behavior of other coronary artery viruses, but recovered cases of COVID-19 have been reported that subsequently gave positive in coronary artery.
These cases are believed to be a worsening of a persistent infection and not a reinfection.
This virus is considered to be natural and of animal origin, through an interspecific infection.
Real origin is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of the infection was almost entirely due to transmission between humans.
A study of the first 41 confirmed COVID-19 cases, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, noted as the first date of onset of symptoms as of December 1, 2019.
Official WHO publications reported that the first manifestation of symptoms was December 8, 2019.
In general, several measures are taken to quantify mortality.
These figures vary by region and in time, in addition to being affected by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, treatment options, the time elapsed from the initial outbreak and the characteristics of the population, such as age, sex and general health.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned emergency IPC-10 disease codes U07.1 to deaths with confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 to deaths with a clinical or epidemiological diagnosis of COVID-19 without confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection laboratory. The lethality rate reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed in a given time interval.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the overall lethality rate is 6.9 per cent (153,822/2 240 191) as at 17 April 2020.
The figure varies by region. Other measures include the mortality rate in diagnosed patients (CFR), which reflects the percentage of people diagnosed who die from a disease, and the mortality rate in infected persons, which reflects the percentage of people infected (with or without a diagnosis) who die from a disease.
These statistics do not depend on time and follow a specific population from infection to case resolution.
While not all infected people produce antibodies, their presence can provide information about how many people were infected.
In the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small villa of 4600 inhabitants, 80 (1.7%) already died.
In Gangelt, the disease spread during carnival festivals and affected the younger ones, so there was a relatively low mortality, and it is possible that not all deaths due to COVID-19 have been classified as such.
Moreover, the German health system has not been exceeded.
In the Netherlands, nearly 3% of the population has antibodies, as determined by blood donors.
It has been confirmed that 69 (0.004% of the population) died from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the mortality rate are different for men and women.
Mortality is higher among men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The greatest risk for men is for those who are in their 50s, and the gap between men and women is only at 90 years of age.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 in males and 1.7 in females.
The exact reasons for this difference by sex are not known, but could be due to genetic and behavioral factors.
Immunological differences based on sex, the lowest number of women smoking, and the fact that males have common conditions, such as hypertension, at an earlier age may have contributed to the highest mortality rate in males.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were males and 72% of those killed by COVID-19 were males.
As of April 2020, the U.S. Government does not trace information on sex in COVID-19 virus infections.
Research shows that viral diseases, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARG, affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of health workers, particularly nursing staff, are women, and are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19".
WHO head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreysus explained that CO refers to crown, VI to virus, D to disease and 19 to the date the outbreak was discovered: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographic location (e.g., China), animal species or group of persons, in line with international recommendations rises denomination to prevent stigmatization. The virus causing COVID-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 virus" in public communications.
It is common to use "coronavirus" to refer both to the disease and to the virus.
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, it was common to refer to the virus and disease as "coronavirus" and "coronavirus de Wuhan".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCov and respiratory disease water for 2019-nCoV as temporary names for the virus and disease, in accordance with the 2015 indication not to use locations in the name of viruses and diseases.
Official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing health material, such as nasal swabs and parts of respirators.
For example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed the valve of a respirator and the supplier could not deliver it in the required time, a local emerging company carried out reverse engineering and printed the 100 necessary valves during the night.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, false information and disinformation about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease that spread rapidly over the Internet emerged.
It seems that humans can transmit the virus to some other animals.
The study found no evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks, or chickens.
There are no medicines or vaccines approved to treat the disease.
Government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers are conducting international research on vaccines and medicines for COVID-19.
In March, the World Health Organization initiated the "SOLIDARITY TEST" to assess the therapeutic effects of the four most promising existing antiviral compounds on efficacy.
There is no vaccine, but several agencies are actively developing possible vaccines.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is being used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ECA2 receptor to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are under investigation.
First, researchers seek to develop a complete virus vaccine.
The use of that virus, whether inactive or dead, aims to generate a rapid immune response from the human body to a new infection by the COVID-19 virus.
A second strategy, subunit vaccines, seeks to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain virus subunits.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research focuses on the S protein that helps the virus get into the ECA2 receptor.
A third strategy is nucleic acid vaccines (DNA vaccines or RNAs, a new technique to create vaccines).
Experimental vaccines from any of these strategies should be studied to determine their safety and efficacy. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine with four volunteers in Seattle began.
The vaccine contains an innocuous copy of the genetic code of the virus causing the disease. It has been suggested that antibody-based improvement is a potential challenge for the development of vaccines against SARS-COV-2, but this is controversial.
In April 2020, there are more than 300 active clinical trials.
Seven trials evaluated already approved malaria treatments, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Readapted antiviral drugs constitute most of the Chinese research, including nine Phase III trials on redesivir in several countries and which are due to report at the end of April.
In April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical developments on the vaccine and possible anti-COVID-19 drugs was under way. A number of antiviral medicinal products were evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, including: remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with interferon-beta.
In March 2020, there is evidence of an attempt on the effectiveness of redesivir.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with the compassionate use of remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the United States, China and Italy. Chloroquina, which was previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020. The results obtained were preliminary.
However, there are requests for peer review for research.
The health authorities in Korea and China recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, although the Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends a daily dose of one gram, it points out that twice that dose is very dangerous and could be lethal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an urgent authorisation for use for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of physicians treating patients with COVID-19. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes the use of interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Further in vivo studies of nitazoxanide have been recommended after determining that low concentrations inhibit SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that initial onion of S protein that performs type 2 transmembranary serine-protease (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with ECA2 receptor.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have important limitations that prevent the medical community from taking these treatments without further studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and does not have a known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
The release of cytokines may be a complication of the last stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have properties that prevent the release of cytokines. China's National Health Commission included tocilizumab in treatment guidelines after completion of a small study.
It is in a national non-randomised phase II test in Italy after observing positive results in people with severe disease.
It is expected that, in combination with a blood analysis of serum ferritin to identify cytokine releases, it counteracts these effects, which are believed to be the cause of death of some infected people.
The FDA approved the interleucin-6 receptor antagonist based on past cases for the treatment of cytokine-resistant steroid-induced cytokine-free syndrome, the treatment of T-CAR T lymphocytes in 2017.
To date, there is no randomised controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system of those who have recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them as a passive immunization method without vaccines is being investigated.
This strategy was tested with the SARG with non-conclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mechanism of action by which passive antibody treatment can defend against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms are possible, such as cell cytotoxicity dependent on antibodies or phagocytosis.
Other forms of passive antibody treatment, for example, are being developed using monoclonal antibodies manufactured.
The production of convalescent serum, which consists of the liquid part of the blood of recovered patients and contains specific antibodies against this virus, could be increased to achieve faster distribution.
Coronavirus Diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, who later died from COVID-19 after raising awareness about the spread of the virus.
