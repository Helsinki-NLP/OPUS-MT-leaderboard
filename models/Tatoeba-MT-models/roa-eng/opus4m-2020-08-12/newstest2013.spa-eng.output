A Republican Strategy to Obstacle Obama's Reelection
The Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Centre considers this to be a myth and states that electoral fraud is less frequent in the United States than the number of people who die because of the fall of a ray.
In fact, Republican lawyers have found no more than 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will adversely affect the participation rate.
In that regard, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike what happens in Canada, the American states are responsible for the organization of the federal elections in the United States.
And in the same vein, a majority of American governments enacted new laws that made registration or voting difficult from 2009.
This phenomenon has expanded following the November 2010 elections, which saw the increase of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
Accordingly, 180 bills were introduced during 2011 restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to present an identity document with a photograph, in addition to a proof of American citizenship.
On the other hand, these laws reduce the periods of advance voting, invalidate the right to register as an elector on polling day and withdraw their right to vote for citizens with criminal record.
Before the 2006 elections, no American state required voters to submit an identity document with photography.
The State of Indiana was the first to demand it.
The United States Supreme Court confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of the Indian law.
Therefore, the Republican authorities rushed to extend this practice to other states.
In recent years these authorities have supported bills in 34 states to force voters to submit an identity document with photography.
It is important to bear in mind that, unlike what happens in Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity document, such as the Social Security Card.
In fact, 11 per cent of American citizens, i.e. 21 million people of voting age, do not have any photo identity documents issued by a government agency in their state.
On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 lack an identity document with these characteristics.
But, often, obtaining the required identity document costs more than $100.
Thus, new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
Indeed, 25 per cent of African Americans, 15 per cent of people earn less than $35,000 a year, 18 per cent of citizens over 65 and 20 per cent of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 do not have an identity document with photography.
And there's more.
In many states students, the voters who vote most for democratic candidates, cannot use the identity document with photography issued by their institution.
In addition, these same states authorize members of fishing or hunting clubs to vote for Republican parties to use the documents issued by such clubs.
Before 2004, no state required the citizenship test to vote.
Arizona was the first state to present this requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have adopted laws that require voters to demonstrate that they are American citizens.
These measures clearly seek to limit the Spanish vote.
It seems that two out of three Spanish voters support the Democratic Party.
On the other hand, Republican legislators supported in 2011 certain laws that undermine voter registration on the same day as polling in eight states.
In addition, they limited the right of individuals and groups to create a support service for voters who wish to register.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general elections, voter registration campaigns contributed to the registration of some 10 million citizens.
The measures taken since 2009 resulted in the registration rate of new voters falling in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators adopted laws in five other states that favoured the reduction in the period of advance voting.
For example, in the 2008 elections in Florida, 33 per cent of the voters who voted in advance were African Americans, while the latter represented only 13 per cent of the state's voters.
In the case of Hispanics it was exactly the same.
These represent only 11 per cent of the voters, which amounts to 24 per cent of the citizens who vote in advance.
However, whites, representing 76 per cent of the electorate, represent only 46 per cent of the citizens who vote in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters have strongly opposed the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
In this regard, democratic governors have blocked several bills.
The United States Prosecutor ' s Office intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
Part of the damage could be limited.
For example, only 16 out of 34 States adopted the law requiring the presentation of an identity document with photography.
However, it is undeniable that the new rules adopted will complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been voted on, as it is clear that they intend to influence the results of 2012 in the key states.
A report by the Brennan Centre of 2011 shows that the states that have adopted those laws represent 171 of the 270 votes needed in the electoral college to achieve the presidency.
It is too early to state with certainty whether these legislative changes to the electoral system will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential elections.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will adversely affect the participation rate.
In this regard, the measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Detection of prostate cancer: Do the test or not?
Indeed, the PSA test sometimes presents erroneous results, with false negative or even false positive results, after which useless medical interventions are decided to perform.
It is more than enough reason to question men, already reluctant to themselves, about whether or not the detection tests should be carried out.
Do the test or not?
We've asked two specialists for advice.
Studies conducted in the United States detected a large rate of infection among sample groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and make firm recommendations.
For its part, the European study showed a certain difference in mortality between patients who had been detected and those who had not.
The study, with a follow-up at 12 years of age, also showed that there is between 30 and 40% of the potential for metastasis if the detection test has not been performed.
I therefore recommend the test from the age of 50, or from the age of 40 if your father has suffered from prostate cancer.
Men of African American origin have a higher risk rate.
The key is to make a good decision once cancer is detected.
There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are indolent.
It is really necessary to make the patient understand the degree of risk of their cancer. You should be offered all possible options and not necessarily treat prostate cancers that do not affect long-term life, in which case you should opt for active surveillance of the disease.
Today many men who have been diagnosed with cancer are not treated, as such cancer is neither aggressive nor poses a risk to their lives.
Instead, we suggest active surveillance of the disease and, if it progresses, we offer them treatment.
We have increasingly determined precise criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.
I recommend that the test be carried out in any case.
But it is important to talk to your doctor to determine whether the test should be performed.
Movember has created, in collaboration with the International Society of Urology, a tool to assess the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Preventing disease
Unfortunately, there is no miraculous recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of research, the adoption of healthy lifestyles remains the best way to reduce the risks of suffering from the disease.
We believe that if everyone ate well and moved well enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
"If no one would smoke, that rate would rise to at least 50%," said André Beaulieu, spokesperson for the Canadian Cancer Society.
Instead, we assess that about 10% of cancers are hereditary.
Many others remain totally inexplicable.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Tobacco is linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for other types of cancers.
It greatly damages people's health.
"Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," spokesperson André Beaulieu said.
A hopeful data: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying of cancer is halved.
The weight
Fat and obesity also favor the onset of the disease, according to CSC.
They increase the risks of breast, colon and rectum cancer, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against breast cancer," they say.
Feeding
The body also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In large quantities, they increase the risk of colorectal cancer.
Charcutery products should also be avoided.
Preservation of meat for smoking, drying or salad may lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"They can damage the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer," they explain.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the linkages between vitamin complexes and cancer.
For the time being, however, their investigations are not conclusive.
According to CSC, studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While in one of them there was a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, in another what was observed was, rather, an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been clearly determined.
On the other hand, Mr Beaulieu stressed the importance of talking about the concerns and family background of each one with his doctor.
"Doing the detection test doesn't cause cancer."
Higgs boson in detail
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson generated a great shock last summer, and rightly so.
It is believed, indeed, that this boson is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of all that exists in the universe, nothing more and nothing less.
And what is more, it is the particle whose existence predicted the standard model: our best or "less evil" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter, which has not yet been empirically observed.
But for physicists it's not entirely clear what it's about Higgs.
We certainly know that there is a new particle and that it is much like the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, new data revealed this week at an important physics congress held in Kyoto seem to confirm that it is, although there are still more data to be completely safe.
Anyway, we assume it's Higgs, because the chances of being wrong seem few.
There is, in this great world, a comprehensive and inescapable law that implies that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
There is no way to break that standard and not try too hard, because it will end up hurting itself.
Although the physics of particles is a very complex world, it has been shown that there is also a law of these characteristics in it: the principle of exclusion of Pauli, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantic state"; a "state" which consists, broadly, of some of its characteristics.
Physicians classify particles into two categories.
On the one hand we meet the good citizens called fermions, who wisely obey Pauli's principle.
And on the other hand there are bosnes, a dirty bunch of anarchists who have no respect for anything, or at least not by this principle, which means they can be found in the same place and at the same time.
According to the website The Particle Adventure of Berkeley Laboratories which, by the way, is extraordinary, bosons are divided into two groups: the mesones, which we will not talk about here, and the "particles of force", by which the great forces of nature spread and with which the Higgs boson would somehow be related.
These bosnes, I would stress here, are not the exotic bugs we could believe.
In fact, if you can read this chronicle, it is thanks to an extraordinarily banal boson: the photon or the "light particle" that acts as "messenger" of electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it "disorders" the electromagnetic field in that precise environment; somewhat like when we throw a stone into a pond.
In this "disorder" is born an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared, ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon; that is, one of the bosnes "bearers of force".
More stable field
It is the same with the Higgs boson, with the difference that it is about another field, the Higgs field, which needs to be "disordered" for this boson to appear.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field. To activate it you need to reach extremely high energies, a little as if it were an iced pond in which only a thick rock could slide across the surface.
That's why it takes a huge particle accelerator like CERN's (the great Hadron Collider is a 27 km ring of circumference!) to reach such energy levels.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between Higgs and the mass.
In fact, not all particles or all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do it, but others do not: a piece of paper, for example, will never stand by itself attached to the door of a refrigerator.
And similarly, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do have a mass, while the rest (like photon, by the way), do not have it.
Now, what "can you bring" all these investigations? asks Mrs. Plamondon.
For science, this is used to verify the validity of the standard model (MS), and also allows physicists to scrutinize the differences between observations and predictions of the MS.
For their part, many earnestly wish them to be found, since the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" that covers certain holes in the model.
This, it must be said, has still enormous shortcomings, as it proposes no explanation concerning gravity (ups!) or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the matter of the Universe (other ups!).
But we have not found such differences in the CERN so far.
Effects
The impact of such research on our day-to-day is difficult to predict, but we do not believe that we are mistaken in saying that it will have none.
To see: in the early 1960s, laser pioneers in laboratories did not suspect at all the revolution that their work would provoke.
They interviewed the scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, as physicist Willard Boyle said, who worked in Bell laboratories, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who elaborated the first continuous laser (the first ones were pulsed) in 1962, at first the laser was considered rather a "laboratory apparatus".
Imagine...
In addition, applications can also come from all the instrumentation that surrounds research.
For example, Willard Boyle himself developed a light catcher in 1969 during his optical research.
Although it was not at all his original intention, this catcher now serves as a "eye" for all digital devices in the world, which was earned by the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
That does not mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC necessarily want to transform our lives, but it is never known...
The best way to die... . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In his Commission to die in dignity, Quebec recently discussed the sensitive question of the end of life.
The debate should be resumed soon as a bill is prepared.
However, within that essential domain, there is still much to do.
Le Devoir tried to see him closely.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his Monterégie apartment.
The prostate cancer that was destroying him had given him a two-year breath.
"I had been given five years of life, but I've been like this for seven years," he relates, made a pass, lying in his bed in the palliative care center Victor-Gadbois de Beloeil, to which he arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, we can't be prepared for this," he continues.
The disease has caused damage to him: a huge weakness that prevents him from going to the bathroom alone and even eating on his own.
Sitting in front of a tasty lunch, he accepts resigned to help him eat.
Brave, he even smiles, talks to strangers who dedicate their attention to him, bring him medicines, and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is to be cured of diarrhea, it's humiliating," she confesses.
A few hours later, the team found a remedy for that disease.
"In the course of our lives we learn that a man is standing up," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois centre.
Returning to their childhood, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
"That depends on the person's ability to accept that regression," he says.
Because, according to the opinion of most people who work in palliative care, the great moments take place in the very heart of that regression.
All patients entering the Victor-Gadbois palliative care center suffer from cancer.
They have a life expectancy of up to three months.
In that state, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer offer "curative" care.
The greatest fear of Mrs. A., 89, is to die "conscious and drowned".
But the disease has made his children discover.
"I have good children," he adds.
"I no longer have desires left in this life," she says, before accepting a mask is placed on her to help her breathe.
And wait, in the next few days, for a last visit from your son who lives in Italy.
Victor-Gadbois offers, with a group of volunteers, body care and food aid.
They are palliative care that is given to them when nothing else can be done.
To help make your death more comfortable.
In Quebec we have a palliative care bed for every 11,700 inhabitants.
It is very little, because we know that we will all die someday.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors in the center.
Whether at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The dying person is offered to rinse his mouth with brandy or Pepsi, according to demand.
Diabetes are no longer controlled by their sugar rate.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served a beer to Mr. X, who died in the course of the night.
This morning, your son finished his beer at the foot of the deceased.
"We help both patients and their loved ones," says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
In the center Victor-Gadbois the days pass without ever being equal.
Next to a 94-year-old man who tastes his last family meeting in the courtyard, well placed between his pillows while all drink to his health, a 36-year-old dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two children, after trying everything to survive.
"For six months now, there have always been three to five beds occupied by people under the age of 45 with cancer," worry Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of the patients admitted to the Victor-Gadboisarrivent center come from their home and 47% from the hospital.
Access to palliative care problem
A 77% of Canadians simply lack access to palliative care, that is, care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient reaches the terminal stage of his life, either at home, in the hospital or in a care center.
And several agencies, such as the Victor-Gadbois Centre and the Grand Montréal Home Palliative Care Society, specialize almost exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely this great relative lack of health care in Quebec which causes many doctors specialized in palliative care to fear the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by eminences of palliative care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has circulated to demonstrate his opposition to this initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not competent enough to ensure that everyone has the right to quality palliative care before euthanasia is accepted.
"Recently," he says, "I have seen a patient spend 14 days in emergencies suffering great pain without having done what is necessary to relieve her.
I'm afraid patients want to die just because they don't get the right care."
And at the same time, many oncologists are obstinate with their patients until the last day, despite the worst predictions.
Hélène Richard's survival hopes were already minimal when he left out exhausting chemotherapy treatment.
"When I told my oncologist that I wanted to stop treatment, she told me that she was very sorry that I wanted to stop fighting," she says.
"But she had told me there was nothing else to do!"
There is no all-powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90 per cent of the patients requesting death are grateful to their caregivers who have not responded to their demands once their pain has been relieved thanks to a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in terms of pain treatment.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at Grand Montréal, patients do not respond to pain treatments in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, physicians usually resort to palliative sedation, which serves to sleep the patient until the moment of death, either sporadic or permanent.
We can't pretend we don't understand that part of suffering.
More and more, the disease will be able to have such palliative sedation.
The sick who are not relieved all say the same thing: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want euthanasia," but "I want to be relieved."
The realization of this reporting has been possible thanks to a journalism grant from Canadian health research institutes.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials of the road network, BTP entrepreneurs, fundraisers of political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia count, day by day, what they know of a formidable "system", of which the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mobsters are part.
A "industry" that was too expensive for Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000.
"It is curious how the system sprays once we have hunted the great media," ironies Jacques Duchesneau, deputy in Quebec and former head of the Montreal Police.
He led the outbreak of the scandal in 2011, which was possible thanks to an in-depth investigation into the abuses linked to road contracts in Quebec, that the liberal prime minister at that time, Jean Charest, had only consented to delay.
The "Duchesneau report" established a direct link between industry, clandestine party financing and corruption among officials.
"Since the start of the investigation in 2010, only the Ministry of Transport would have saved billions of dollars in contracts," containing some of its instincts to stay with a proportional share.
The Charbonneau Commission "has already dropped two mayors", he adds, while hoping to be able to "show the existing stratages behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, created in 2011, also applies with its team of government interventioners, researchers and analysts.
This unit also works for police officers from "Marteau Squadra", who, since 2009, have made Montreal's "cartel of sewerage" moderate when inflating contracts.
In recent weeks, the unit has made a series record of allegations of fraud and corruption against municipal charges such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a city on the outside.
Next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who just resigned from his post as mayor of Laval, third city of Quebec.
Repeated bribes are suspected of being paid in return for public contracts.
Engineers of the Montreal road network and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambio, have been formally accused.
The latter has caused shock by explaining to the commission the mechanics of the "system" of obtaining public contracts.
He himself paid for three years 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediary linked to the Mafia who transferred the money to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gerald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambiro distributed money to the left and left during the 2000s, granting over $88,000 (about €68,000) to provincial parties, especially to the liberals in power.
He also admitted having organized a collection of illegal funds for former Liberal Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Inflation of the cost of sewerage contracts
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked effectively.
Gilles Surprenant, former public works engineer, explained this perfectly before the commission: in ten years he received gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey parties and bribes from construction companies for a total of $736,000, all in exchange for sewerage contracts whose costs were incurred.
Other road network officials have admitted that they received money to inflate invoices between 30 per cent and 40 per cent for false extras.
In addition, an organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately taking a look at a parallel budget and filled his dirty money arks.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November and led Montreal to a huge crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montreal's first elected policies that made the alarm sound.
As mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district, in the east of the island, since 2010, he opposed the sale of a municipal land purchased for $5 million and reselled 1.6 million to developers in full real estate boom.
70% of electoral campaign money was dirty money
From the research that will finally be carried out, she ensures that she pulls "out of a thread in order to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop gangrene and fish the culprits".
And he adds that the process is "painful, but positive."
We are cleaning up the wounds but a clean research unit in Montreal would need to be very vigilant so that dubious practices do not repeat themselves.
How to clean up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, declares that "the officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars," but is concerned above all about the role of '"elect politicians aware of the strategy".
Estimated by 70% the proportion of dirty money that was devoted to the financing of electoral campaigns in Quebec, ironic: "I have been told that this is nothing but a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to parties to $100, but that will not change the donation, he says, "while electoral expenses are not strictly limited, there will be dirty money in politics."
It recommends a complete review of the system of awarding public contracts and party financing: "we cannot fall any lower; going to the bottom of things, bravely, will allow us to rebuild the house with stronger foundations, with more controls and laws."
If this story tangles the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who would look into the mirror.
"The PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
This season has acquired a new entity with the PSG.
How would you explain that advance?
It could be explained by an individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of the GSP.
Big players have arrived.
Advance from day to day next to him.
The technical staff also contributed a lot to me.
And those elements push me daily to raise the level of my game.
In a game, that's easier.
Everything goes very fast on football.
But I don't get slow.
From my beginnings at INF Clairefontaine's preformation centre to my passage through Saint-Etienne, I have always advanced to vigorous steps.
He's going to benefit from the competition recruited by Carlo Ancelotti.
This summer's recruits are used to fighting high-level matches.
They know that every training is crucial.
That makes a player like me want to fight and give it all.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti has been very helpful to me in terms of my position.
It is supported by attachments like Claude Makeelele, who played in the same position as I did.
Is Ancelotti the man who needed the team?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technicians.
Today, there is no one equal in League 1 and it is among the best European trainers.
He has a great experience and has won numerous titles with the best clubs.
He's worked with great players.
I think you'll take other titles to Paris.
In January I had a very comforting conversation with him.
I just got out of a series of injuries.
The trust he has in me also explains my good performance.
What do you think about the GSP in the first part of the season?
In League 1, Lyon took our lead.
But we're still in the ambush.
One of our biggest goals is the Champions League: we have classified ourselves for the eight finals in style.
What is the club's goal in this competition?
Let's try to get as far as possible.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we have a lot to say in front of many and very good European teams.
We want, first of all, to finish the first of our league in front of the Port so we can receive the round of eight finals.
Can the PSG become a great European club in the short term?
You already have the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris has to win titles and be there in the long run.
Today, that's not the case.
At the economic level, the GSP is committed to its means for the implementation of this project.
Don't win the Cup on League 1, as in the last season, would it make a big failure?
Of course, it would be a great disappointment.
This year we are going to invest all our efforts in taking that title of champions.
In the last season we didn't get far.
In May we were disappointed because we had the optimal conditions to finish first.
We had a strong season.
We're done with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points we should have been champions...
But another team, the Montpellier, had a much better season.
This year I think it'll be the good one.
Even if big teams like Marseilles, Lyons and Bordeaux fight for the title, I think we have the guns to carry it for us.
Do you think the media expect more from the PSG?
It is normal that they expect a lot from us if we think about what has been invested in the players we have.
We totally accepted it.
After we won 4-0 at Troyes' house, they still find things that reproach us is a little frustrating.
We wonder what else people are waiting for.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We're not the FC Barcelona!
We are trying to launch a game project.
A team is built over time.
In the Champions League we have shown that we can respond and be present.
Look at Manchester City that, after two seasons, has not managed to rank for the eighth of the end, and they have also invested a lot!
In view of the sums invested, we would imagine you with 15 points of advantage during the day.
That would neglect our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not well the previous season, have been "incited" by this new PSG.
That shows that League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we can say with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we have ended up carrying the trophy.
The PSG seems totally dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic's successes.
Better than saying we have a "Zlatandependence."
That means that Ibrahimovic is very competent and has many goals.
He's here to prove he's the Star of League 1.
And he's proven on all the teams he's been through, he's a great player, a world star.
In the group we respect the man and the player.
And he also respects the men around him.
What he has done is truly exceptional.
That pushes others to increase their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows us all to make progress.
How did you live the Euro Cup 2012 with the French team?
It was a disappointment.
I was very excited to participate in this Eurocopa.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from accumulating game time.
I saw things there and I stepped up.
Today I manage to play good games in the selection.
That's what I've been waiting for since my baptism with the blues.
We have learned the lesson from what happened in Ukraine, and that is why we have exemplary behaviour today.
What vision do you have of Didier Deschamps' first month in front of the "bleus"?
He's getting results.
They are well located in the World ranking group.
The picker is rigorous, close to the players and inspires to win.
As was the case with Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make comparisons.
Blanc achieved his goal of classifying us for the Euro Cup.
I hope Didier Deschamps takes the selection to Brazil.
Did the tie (1-1) of 16 October in Spain serve to lay the foundations?
That game gave us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, I had not lived a similar game in my entire career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
All contrary to current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing charges between the parties.
Furthermore, as often happens in technologies, political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, composed of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is at the same time a virtual currency convertible to dollars, euros, etc. and a secure exchange protocol in the way of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files equal to the same.
Nearly 200,000 transactions have been recorded thanks to 15,000 network computers.
And about a thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a form of payment.
The bitcoin quote, having reached the top of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to 2 dollars five months later, before returning today to round the ten dollars (quotations are recorded on the bitcoincharts.com page).
It is nothing impressive if we compare it to global changes in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in it in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
In it, bitcoin was described as "the most successful virtual currency", "competing with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other systems with types of virtual coins such as "credit", used to advance in a video game and that can be won by playing or can be purchased (and even sometimes by swapping).
The social network Facebook also developed this type of system.
But in every exchange a central authority controls and treats changes.
With the bitcoin, all network nodes are both depositaries of accounting books, verifiers, currency issuers and buyers and sellers.
How does that network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually made between two e-mail addresses.
A user can choose a different address for each payment, thus guaranteeing anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is signed electronically through a double-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the changes of bitcoins consist of the public account book, which is spread throughout the network.
The key milestone is to write that new transaction into that book.
This goes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to computers and the winner, a sort of provisional central banker, will have the privilege to add that complementary line.
It is a phase of file-cutting, i.e. transforming a large file into a shorter and more unique numerical footprint.
The computers "cogene" the new transaction and add a number before "trace" the set.
The goal is to find the number that offers a particular footprint (more zero at the beginning).
Once that number is found, the other nodes easily verify that it is the good one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of sets of other transactions; any modification would change the fingerprint.
If, to commit a fraud, one user would like to pay twice with the same money very quickly (in less than ten minutes), the network would accept only one of the two transactions as valid; the other would be orphaned, as both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solves the challenge takes 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this reward is divided into two regularly, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible up to the 100 millionth, leaving a wide margin.
The difficulty of this challenge is also revealed in each increase in the calculus power.
The life of the network already has its heights.
The websites that offer Bitcoin services have been attacked and bitcoins stolen in storage.
"The error used does not affect the same protocol," says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real currency payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also takes into account the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash presents the same defect.
Weight actors like Wikipedia reject payments of this type.
Others, like the Wordpress platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, of the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the book of accounting and showed that about 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, the "giant rebates" were launched.
"Three thousand dollars have been changed," rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who turns bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, author of a pedagogical book on that coin, believes quite in the potential of this technology in addition to in the network of transactions.
Your system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a mobile payment without contact, but uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which are cheaper.
The carrier also manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system is easy to launch in businesses, which do not have to install new terminals or software.
They just need to provide an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize," says Pierre Noizat, who assures thousands of users.
There is a general movement of revision of hierarchical systems by more horizontal systems.
"It will take a while for Bitcoin to stand up, but in 2013 there could be a change," he predicts.
Furthermore, in its report, the ECB plans to reassess the various risks, today considered high, if this currency succeeds.
We're out of Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops left their zone of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapsa and Surobi).
NATO and Americans must leave at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without expecting anything from us.
We have primarily punished the Afghan peasants, whom we have considered terrorists.
And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, plus the wounded and the mutilated.
The Taliban have foreign extremists and former refugee leaders in Pakistan, but often also peasants who reject the presence of the foreign army, as in Soviet times.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if their causes unite the jihadists, the Pakistani, the Arabs, the Uzbek or the Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes even assisted by local insurgents, they will no longer be when Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the Nijrab base, which was observed from the top of the hills planted with almond trees thanks to the French credits, was done by order.
Truck and tank convoys returned to Kabul without having suffered any attacks, guarded by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban in Kabul from the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since their irresistible progress between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul was then empty and the country wrapped in fire and blood because of the struggles between different factions.
Its takeover of the country had been perceived as a kind of liberation, the return to security.
Afghans have paid the price of the obscurantism of their peasants overrun by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation is not better today.
The long-lived people, the current government and the present Taliban share the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main personalities of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become speculators, using government land to sell them as solar for refugees returning from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from huge US subcontracting contracts.
They are discredited; most of them have not fought.
People, as I have heard in the field, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have learned to take advantage of American generosity: capital flight is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and their ideologies.
They have lived the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan and have appreciated their advantages.
With about 65 per cent of its population under the age of 25, Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one fifth of the total population.
In cities, state schools are full of both girls and boys.
These young people must be given work that they will not want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
All, including the armed opposition, are eager for mobile phones. Television and its Turkish leaflets presenting a modern world have great admirers throughout the country.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who want to lead the country be considered legitimate?
The former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already concerned about reconstitution of the provincial militias, which will flee from central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, of strong local identities, should be able to benefit from some decentralization in the image of the Western nations; however, the United States has wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with a strong presidential power, eliminating the position of the prime minister that existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, in particular because of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, their country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and even before.
No industry has re-established its services, no packaging has been fixed or major irrigation systems have been repaired.
Everything is imported and nothing is produced except fruits and vegetables.
Priority is left to private initiative.
In a country ruined after 30 years of war, government control would have been necessary.
The rumor was spread that Afghanistan had immense mining wealth.
And that only increased the feeling that the Westerners were there to take hold of them.
No energy to extract iron or copper minerals from the ground and no means of transport to export them through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have already almost abandoned the copper mines of Mes Aynak, allowing international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to excavate the vast Buddhist site and remain there as the most important employers in the province.
Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports are largely dependent, will also need to restore their normal relations.
The French troops left on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls' schools, children's schools, a French department at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, health and agricultural fields and support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in order to try to "win the hearts and spirits" and to perform the impossible task of making aid and offensive actions coincide, a service of "civil and military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cemic), suppressed in 2012, brought and brought through a small French NGO numerous works of collective interest and actions of agricultural rehabilitation in dozens of mountain resorts.
These works, which are keen to obtain local labor, have been able to help contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, sun protection and increased crop areas.
What will we leave as a reminder after two million euros of military expenditure?
A more modest budget will contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very hard in those valleys which are often more than 2,000 metres high.
The Embassy received dozens of written requests with small agricultural proposals made by local communities in Kapisa province.
In order for them to be freed from the insurrection carried out by foreign groups, something that farmers have told me they want, it would be necessary to maintain a small civilian aid, well controlled and to reach them directly.
A Constitution with Forces in Egypt
It's a new double or nothing from President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever as regards the constitutional declaration, which temporarily grants it full powers, he decided to play the whole.
He took everyone by surprise on Wednesday, when he announced that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the following day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State had given that Assembly two more months to finish its work.
And nearly two years ago, Egypt used a provisional text, several times modified, which weakened institutional stability and led to judicial fraud.
This new initiative has only increased the fracture in the country.
For his opponents, the president perseveres in his "autocratic delirium" and continues to "tray his word" and "trail the law."
On the part of its supporters, it is ensured that this is a measure to speed up the institutional and political crisis and accelerate the transition process.
A referendum should be held in the next 15 days.
A very short period of time requiring the Brothers to renounce their draft to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the president, it is also a way of recovering a popular and democratic legitimacy while the controversy causes damage throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote for him, as he said in an interview to the American weekly Time.
Considering that this appeal has been voted very quickly, it contains an ultimatum for the Egyptian people: "or they vote on my text or I maintain full powers", powers which are supposed to end with the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in this strange environment in which 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, Islamist largely, voted the text yesterday.
Most liberals did not go to the summons.
In mid-November, just before the constitutional declaration, they had closed the door because they felt they could not enforce their views.
The representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society did the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum yesterday morning, 11 people, substitute members, were added in a hurry.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brothers.
As I had hoped, the articles voted were unanimously.
On the other hand, the commentators are pleased that one of the few discrepancies in the day has been expressed practically at the time of prayer, so much so that several members of the committee came to think that the Constituent's watch was wrong.
The text, which was still being voted on yesterday, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, subject to all looks, remains at last identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, which stipulated that “the principles of Sharia constitute the main source of law”.
Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a fundamental claim, hoped that "the principles" could be replaced by "the rules", which would have allowed stricter application.
For Islamists, this article has not been modified is a guarantee of their goodwill and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
Liberals view it as hypocritical and consider it nothing more than an advertising craft.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They refer, in particular, to article 220, which confers an advisory role on Al-Azhar University, in particular for anyone who has to confirm its conformity with the laws of Sharia.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing because "people called to pronounce are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here we see the premises of a theocracy."
The fears of the liberals are further increased by the fact that the next rector of that university would be much less moderate than the present one.
"For now, there is no concrete religious implication.
With this Constitution we are within the framework of the civil status.
Most jurists who have worked in this text are not Ulemas but university students, some of them formed in the French system," Alexis Blouet explains, who prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he recognizes that there may be some ambiguity around article 220, since the terms used imitate the religious vocabulary.
"We refer specifically to the term iqh [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].
And the question that might arise in the future would be to what extent are the civil judges competent to pronounce themselves above all of this."
Beyond its religious character, the text voted yesterday has received many criticisms concerning the extended powers conferred on the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brothers will claim that they are few compared to those during the previous regime.
Another conflicting point: the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the revision of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a national defence council.
Nor would civil prosecutions in military courts be prohibited, as requested by human rights associations.
They also expressed their concerns about the text, which they consider to be liberticide.
The crime of blasphemy is maintained and, from now on, insults are prohibited, which could lead to serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially that of the press.
In addition, no article emphasizes the protection of women, stresses Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive has been the prohibition of torture in accordance with article 36.
The word was not contained in the previous Constitution.
Although the Egyptian president had to go out last night on television, demonstrations are scheduled for noon.
The supporters of the Head of State protested on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for the holy land, the world's ombudsman and a sea of salmon
The promised earth combines the majesty of Bible truths with modern comfort and a pristine nature.
"AIF" identified the five most important reasons why Israel should be visited.
Reverence in the Holy Land
It is worth visiting the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
Anyone entering this "baptismal pillar" is believed to receive divine grace.
And Galilee, the place of the miracles of Jesus: the conversion of water into wine at the wedding, walking on the waters, the calming of the storm and the nets filled.
In this same place, Jesus appeared before his disciples after the resurrection.
But the greatest number of holy places is in Jerusalem.
The believers go here on the Viacrucis or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (in Latin "Wicked Way").
It begins in the Fortaleza de Antonio, the Pretoria, where the trial took place, and continues along the streets of the Old City, goes to the Holy Sepulchre on Mount Golgota, the place of crucifixion, the Stone of the Unction and the place of burial of Jesus.
In this same place there is also the symbolic Christian Ombudsman of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem, built in the place where, according to a Christian legend, there was a tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem there is also the most sacred place for the Jews, the Wall of Regrets; the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
As is tradition, people of different religions leave notes here with their desires, which will then come true.
Perform a vertical journey
The ruins of the Masada Fortress were what remained of a secret refuge against the enemies, which Herod the Great commanded to build in 25 B.C. for his family.
They are located in the mountain cliffs at a height of 450 m above sea level.
And getting there by their own means, they can only those who dedicate themselves to climbing.
Others can reach this historic summit in the funicular.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m is the famous Hermon ski resort, where in the winter months there is a great influx of tourists.
Up to there, from the foot of the hill, bus services are offered.
The total length of the ski slopes is 45 km.
According to an ancient legend, on the top of the mountain, pagan gods were supposed to dwell.
Visit unique museums
In this country there are about 300 museums.
On a single trip you won't be able to visit all of them.
But it is worth visiting at least five of them, the most interesting.
Among them is the Israel Museum, located near the Knesset (Israeli Parliament).
It preserves the ancient Manuscripts of the Dead Sea or Rollos de Qumran, discovered in the caves of the desert of Judaea, and about 500,000 archaeological and anthropological pieces.
It is worth visiting the Museum of Art in Tel Aviv.
In his exhibition he has paintings of Impressionists and Expressionists such as Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall or Picasso.
In Acre you can visit the Al Basha bathroom museum, which are some rooms of old Turkish baths with model figures of visitors and bathers of that time.
In Cesarea it is worth passing through the exclusive private museum Ralli, where you can admire the sculptures of Rodin and Dalí.
There are no tourist guides or souvenir shops there.
Entry is free, and donations are categorically not accepted.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, shows one of the most dramatic pages in history.
The most tragic section is the Children's Memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter it and you find yourself in absolute darkness.
The stars are shining.
And the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they lost their lives sound.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health
The three main tourist areas of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of them there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphins and oceanographic museums.
It is curious that in the Red Sea they bathe even in the winter months, as the water temperature does not decrease from 21 degrees and the air warms up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and there they bathe all year round.
By the way, this sea, the most extraordinary in the world, is at the lowest point on the planet: 417 m below sea level.
The blue waters there are a brine that easily sustain up to those who cannot swim.
The surrounding landscapes are truly beautiful.
People arrive here to pass treatment courses with salt water, salmon and curative clays and to strengthen their health in cases of dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to put their broken nerves in order.
Touching the mysteries of antiquity
It preserves the ancient part of Tel Aviv, the citadel of Jaffa, on the Mediterranean coast.
She passed through the famous maritime route that united Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, this was where Noah built his ark and Perseus rescued the beautiful Andromeda with whom, in this same place, he led a long and happy life.
Tourists love walking along the narrow streets bearing the names of the Zodiac signs.
They say if you touch the walls on the street of your symbol "me", fortune will be in your favor.
In Jaffa you can find newly married couples who come from all over Israel, and even from other countries to photograph.
And in Caesarea, the city of King Herod, one can walk through the Roman theater, "take" the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of the Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The theater, carefully restored, is now used for night concerts and opera shows.
Tourists Remember
If you travel to Israel, do not worry if your English leaves much to desire: in this country about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
The money for this trip is not recommended to take it in euros, but in dollars, which can be easily exchanged to shekels (currently $1-3,8 shekels).
Urban transport consists mainly of buses, but in Jerusalem there is a quick tram and in Haifa there is the only metro line in the country, which consists of six stations and connects the Lower City with the High City.
Actually, it's from an underground funicular.
Traveling in any type of public transport costs 6 shekels and for this price you can travel by transhipment for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated on Saturday.
From Friday night to sunset on Saturday, markets and shops close and public transport interrupts their work.
But Sunday morning starts a new work week.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels only kosher food is served, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes in which milk and meat are combined.
There is a wide selection of dishes based on beef and lamb, soups and desserts prepared with coconut milk, the traditional Hebrew cream called hummus, a wide variety of sauces, the falafel, which are balls of ground grass, fruits and vegetables.
There are no street dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
On the other hand, there are many well-fed cats who "walk to their taste" imposingly.
At night you can see them sleeping even on the roofs of cars parked.
The rodents love the crowded places and don't reject the gourds.
Car rental, depending on the brand, will cost from $37 (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day.
In addition to insurance, it goes out for $15 a day.
And renting a bike will take you out for 15 shekels a day.
The entrances to the museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
Israel in Figures
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most of those who arrived to travel and rest were citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and Ukraine.
The Promised Land, from January to October 2012, was visited by 118,8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, amounting to 51 per cent at the same rate as in 2010, before the cancellation of the visa regime on 9 February 2011.
"The great and powerful" will take you to Moscow: immigrants save for language
While Members and human rights defenders discuss the consequences of the law on compulsory examination, they have already appeared in the country as shy as they trade with "false" certificates.
Each year, 13 million immigrant workers arrive in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asian countries: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to help their families who have stayed home.
Since 1 December, a law has entered into force, whereby each immigrant worker must carry out an examination to verify his knowledge of the Russian language.
For now, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service sector, Community service institutions, domestic services and retail trade.
However, over time, as they promise in the Federal Immigration Service, examinations will be mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, it would not be sufficient to conduct the language review, except also the Russian history and the fundamentals of the legislation.
Knowledge of the language must be confirmed even to receive and renew the work permit.
The exception is the citizens of the countries where Russian is the official language.
Persons who obtained their education certificates and diplomas before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 will not be subject to this law.
Utility, fatality and defence of rights
The network of examining centres will operate under the auspices of the Russian Language Institute Pushkin, the University of Peoples' Friendship, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants will be able to submit themselves to the tests in all cities, and more than 160 such centres are open right now in Russia.
The initiative on the introduction of the review was supported by Members of the State Duma and the Federal Immigration Service.
But the rights defenders, long before the law came into force, often managed to ask this question to the press: What will this really bring?
What changes will the compulsory knowledge of the language, both for the Russians and for immigrants themselves?
First, the representatives of the Immigration Service respond, which will reduce the number of people suffering "labour slavery".
Many people are talking today about defending the rights of immigrants, explains Victor Sebelev, head of the Russian Federal Immigration Service in Tajikistan.
The defence of their rights must begin before they leave.
Only an organized selection system will solve the problem of immigrant workers in 90 per cent of cases.
The problems are experienced by immigrants without profession, education, those who do not know the language or pass medical control.
Without understanding the language, says Sebelev, the immigrant future will be doomed to finding unscrupulous people who, on the pretext of helping, put a "paid journey" into a creepy and narrow covacha, where he and dozens of others like him consume themselves for months without food or documents, working from 12 to 14 hours a day.
We receive a number of complaints from our immigrants.
"In their homeland they are promised one thing, but when they arrive they are deceived, they are deprived of their passports, they are not paid the promised wages," confirms the Head of the Labour Immigration Directorate of the Immigration Service of Tajikistan, Tolib Sharipov.
Don't be angry, boss!
In the meantime, however, many citizens of Central Asian republics who want to work in Russia recognize that not only do they not know the language of the country they intend to go to, but they also write in their own language with difficulty.
Of course, this is not so much their fault but their own misfortune: few Turkmen, Uzbek, Tajiks can afford to receive normal primary education.
This is because their families even have nothing to feed their children, for not talking about dressing them, shoes and buying them what they need for school.
When they reach adolescence, these boys venture to work at the first opportunity.
It's hard, if you don't know the language, they recognize them.
"One feels humiliated and inferior."
However, as far as the law on language is concerned, rights defenders point to an important point.
The examinations shall be carried out only for those immigrants whose status is legal.
If they do not have that status, there will be no examination and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile, most immigrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or forbidden to strangers"
Many visitors claim that receiving official status in our country is not so easy.
The cause is bureaucratic obstacles and difficulties in the language itself.
In addition, legalization costs money: from twelve thousand to sixteen thousand roubles.
However, a false inscription can be made quickly and by only a thousand five hundred rubles.
Russian police employees know that we usually carry fake documents, we are not registered and cases of extortion appear.
"We are asked for a hundred or two hundred roubles for cigarettes or tea," the citizen of Tajikistan, Umed Hushkadamov, commented to journalists.
"Come on, don't be a jerk, buy a painting."
On the first day of the entry into force of the Language Act, it was made clear that not only the registration documents of immigrants can be false.
Several "false" language knowledge certificates have already been seized by officials of the Federal Immigration Service.
The falsified documents had been printed on standard color printers.
Of course, they came to the hands of the new owners not as a gift: each immigrant, wanting to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is twice and a half more expensive than the official examination procedure, which will cost the immigrant worker three thousand rubles.
The main task for the near future is to protect the system from corruption so that "diplomas" cannot be bought, converge the government officials and rights defenders.
So far, the authorities can promise immigrant workers that they could not have successfully passed the examination for the first time to study the basic course of the language.
In addition, non-Russian immigrants will be offered jobs that do not require active communication with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not take drastic measures against illegal arms trade
The percentage of offences committed with recorded weapons is quite low
The Ministry of the Interior proposes to apply the law more rigorously with regard to the owners of civilian weapons.
This is the government's reaction to recent incidents: Shooting during wedding celebrations where there were no victims, and the massacre initiated by Moscow lawyer Dimitri Vinográdov, in which kidnapping seven people lost their lives.
The police want to prohibit the use and possession of traumatic weapons in public places and raise the minimum age for obtaining a licence to carry weapons, from 18 to 21 years old.
This idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Combating Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that reforms in the law on possession of weapons will be brought to the Duma of the State in the near future.
Not everyone is pleased that the Russian authorities are trying to counter this problem by applying the "hard-handed policy".
An open letter has appeared in the network, whose authors, representatives of various social organizations of shooters, demand that such measures of "foolish rigour" be waived.
The percentage of vandalism with recorded weapons is minimal, commented at the BBC news service of Russia, criminal lawyer Vasiliy Lésnikov.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, for six months of the year 2012, 142 offences were committed using firearms registered in internal organs, compared with a total of 1168 offences registered for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that stricter legislation in the civil arms sector will not be a disadvantage for the offender to turn to the black market.
Now, according to his words, in Moscow you can find any weapon at low price.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior states that the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factory to official
The black arms market is supplied through several channels.
The main channels are years, says retired Colonel Victor Baranets, who worked in the Ministry of Education and the High Staff for ten years.
Screenshot of the website that accepts orders for weapons
The first, "experimental of the army or military," that is, the weapons that were stolen during military actions in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by the Russian officers and by the same Caucasians," Baranets says.
The following type of "black weapon", stolen by criminals and representatives of the security forces.
Baranets explains that here are the stolen weapons from police warehouses and those stolen directly by law enforcement officials.
Illegal weapons are on sale from military arsenals.
There were often explosions in many military arsenals.
"There are proven versions that some fires were premeditated to cover the lack," says one ex-military.
According to Baranets, weapons manufacturers also put on their sand granite.
"They have now proliferated private arms factories that are not competitive in the international market and distribute weapons under rope to the black market, including that of Moscow," said the expert.
One more source of the black market is smuggling.
Lots of guns and machine guns come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan.
"There they have their own production, sometimes artisanal, and a mafia has formed that has organized the flow of weapons," ex-military explains.
Where do guns come from?
Experts have calculated the approximate participation of each of these sources of supply of illegal weapons to the black market.
A report on this subject was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problems Analysis and Planning of Public Management.
The experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminological bibliography and public access data from portals whose theme revolves around weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to investigators, come from the armed forces and the security forces.
Half of the black market weapons have arrived there "because of officials whose work is related to weapons," the report says.
According to researchers, 17 per cent of weapons come from places where there are armed conflicts, 14 per cent of cases are stolen during weapons production and 5 per cent are “illegal archaeology”.
The dependent on one of the weapons stores, who asked for his last name not to be mentioned, says that the weapons found by illegal excavators have not been bought by anyone for a long time because they are too old.
More often, he says, suppliers go to military warehouses when they need a match.
Through some referee, the supplier buys a unit, for example a TT gun.
They remove it from the register and pass it over the fence.
"This takes the gun to the city and sells it to 900 euros per unit with two shippers," he tells us.
"But, of course, the police are aware of all matters, so periodically, when the crime discovery plan has to be carried out, they make evidence purchases to illegal arms dealers," the dependent adds.
"Like in a luxury boutique"
The seller and buyer are usually found through acquaintances.
"I visited websites and blogs until a guy who suggested me to go to the "Begovaya" platform, where he would be a man who would take me to a "squinita" where we could negotiate.
From the price of the weapon, I found out only there."
Military commentator Viktor Baranets
"To get a gun I need a friend who has contacts," says the store's deputy. "I have a friend like that, but I don't trust him very much."
In the markets there are sellers, but there must also be arrived, we say "on behalf of Mr. Ivanovih, who asked him to tell him that his daughter had fallen a tooth."
I can even get a couple of steel knobs through a trusted person.
He also supplies them only to me because he knows I'm not going to delay him.
Novices are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military Viktor Baranets was tested for the role of buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when an article on this subject was prepared to be published.
The schemes, according to his words, have not changed.
They gave him a photo album where there wasn't "all."
"I felt like in a luxury boutique," recalls the military.
To the buyer, according to Baranets' words, they don't offer cat for hare: all there is can be tried.
I, as a potential customer, not only buy; we go with the seller to the forest, where we put a target.
"They give me the chance to shoot and when I make sure the gun shoots well, we start negotiating," the expert describes the procedure.
Sofa store
Web search engines lead to sites and groups of "Vkontakte", where they offer to buy weapons "for different purposes".
No personal documents or meetings are required for this.
"It's enough to have a certain amount of money," they write in the title of the advertising notice "Buying a gun or machine gun."
There the users make their orders and ask questions.
And they sell minors?
"No permission, of course," asks the user "Ivan" (preserved spelling).
"I buy TT. Moscow gun," laconically asks his question "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictional websites and captures those who want to buy firearms by hand.
And people go, like hungry fish to the bait, and then, to extract coal in Siberia
military commentator and ex-military Viktor Baranets
I have heard of these systems: usually the website is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People make orders.
The buyer makes the payment through an automatic cashier.
"In response, they send you a photo and instructions to know where the weapon is hidden," reports the NGO press secretary "The right to arms", Dmitri Kislov.
Viktor Baranets claims that if an online order is made, one is left without a gun and put him in jail.
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictional websites and captures those who want to buy firearms by hand.
"And people go, like hungry fish to the bait, and then to extract coal in Siberia," he says.
Makarov per $100
In the purchase of illegal firearms, according to experts, one can be spent from $100 to 900.
According to Dmitri Kislov of the NGO "The right to arms", a Makarov gun can be purchased for $100-300.
You must wait a month and a half.
It is sent from military warehouses by middle-ranking chiefs.
According to the official statistics of the ministry, compared to the period January-October 2011, the total number of these crimes in Russia was reduced by 7%, which is 22.900, and the number of cases identified of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
Employees from fast food restaurants and supermarkets in the United States are being struck by strike.
Up to a quarter of American teenagers find their first jobs as cashiers in "McDonald's"
In recent days, in the United States, a wave of protests against the low wages paid in the Walmart corporation supermarkets and in restaurants of popular fast food chains such as "McDonald's", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken".
For now no one dares to assert whether or not this wave will reach the nine points, or if it is destined to lose strength and fall in love in its early stages.
Protest actions have the support of trade unions and a number of left-wing NGOs.
In addition to the increase in the modest wages received by Walmart workers and those of the fast food system, the aim of the protest organizers is to create workers' unions in these companies.
For now, this sector of the economy has hardly been occupied by the trade union movement.
Forty-six cents a year?
The actions began last week, after Thanksgiving, the so-called "Black Friday." That day, in the United States, it co-ordinated the orgy of rebates that captured millions of people, and that was sometimes accompanied by clashes.
On that day, some workers from the Walmart corporation, who employ 2.2 million people in the world, left their jobs and formed protest pickets alongside trade unions and left-wing activists in the corporate stores, whose products are directed at people with modest and moderate incomes.
Walmart sells everything, from diapers, hunting rifles and batteries for cars, to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products in their stores are on average between 8% and 27% cheaper than those in larger supermarkets.
That's why many poorly paid Walmart workers buy only at work.
The availability and output of products have made Walmart one of America's largest corporations.
According to the words of two critics, Walmart can afford to sell products at very low prices, partly because he pays little to his workers.
The latter also complain about bad working conditions, such as the lack of hand-held mounts or scanners.
That "Black Friday" the participants of the demonstration demanded an increase in wages and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation increased from $30 to $100 per month.
For a typical Walmart worker, who receives $9.5 an hour, this expense is excessive, they said.
Scientists at the University of California in Berkeley argue that if Walmart increases the average salary to $12$ per hour, this will cost the corporation $3.2 billion.
This is about 1.1% more than spent on wages now.
If Walmart puts the wage increase on the shoulders of consumers, each visit to the store will result in only 46 cents more expensive.
In a year they will spend the ridiculous amount of $12.39 more than they spend now.
Walmart's supporters commented satisfied that the protest took place only in nine states and that it did not cause any loss to the corporation.
The "Black Friday" was extended in its stores from 8 a.m. on Thursday until midnight the following day and during that time Walmart sold about 5000 items per second.
In total, their registers carried out the "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
The company's representative, Dan Fogelman, stated in an interview to the left-wing Huffington Post website that left his job "less than five" employees of Walmart and that the protest had only been "other public relations trick", organized by the workers' union.
"Free box!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where the goals were not exactly the big Walmart warehouses (which in this progressive city are not appreciated, and so for now there is none), but the "McDonald's" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says he sells billions of portions, and then they don't even give you sick leave and they don't pay you for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, member of the City Council of New York
Currently, according to federal and New York law, the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants are increasing over time, but only slightly, and on average, regular workers receive in New York $8.90 an hour.
Nobody earns less than them in this city.
How it's possible to survive in New York with that money, for me it's something incomprehensible.
There was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers passed through the McDonalds and worked there, behind the exhibitors, part-time after school, although they still lived with their parents.
Few saw this as the main source of income or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now, I constantly stumble in some interviews with McDonald's workers who complain that they have to live from this salary, and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, in a Wall Street Journal forum there is a comment whose author points out that it is irresponsible to have children if he does not know what to feed them with.
The participants in the protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday morning at the McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and fast-food cooks start paying at least $15 an hour, i.e. to double their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that unions of workers be created in the fast food sector.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from preventing these rights and punishing union activists with arguments and dismissals.
On the other hand, administration rarely makes life easier for them.
But for objective reasons, it is easy for trade unions to cover the fast food sector.
One of the main issues is the excessive rotation of staff.
Discordants
Noisy protests took place that same day in other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the action took place in the middle of the rally at the McDonald's located near Times Square, where several local Democrats politicians participated, in particular the City Council member Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's says he is selling billions of portions, and then he doesn't even give you a hospital or pay you for your honest work."
The demonstrators received support from other leading New York Democrats, such as the mayor of the city Bill de Blasio, who said that "we must support the workers in the fast food sector to get fair wages and the economic prosperity that each New Yorker deserves."
As described in the New York Times newspaper, this has been the biggest manifestation of this type in the American history of fast food.
But only a few hundred people participated in it, even not all of them were employees of the fast food service, in which tens of thousands of people from New York worked.
It is not yet clear whether this will serve as a spark to provoke a massive movement.
"For now, deceiving the brain is not that easy"
The theme of increased reality, so popular among modern technology enthusiasts, has recently been generally perceived mainly through the prism of special glasses.
At the beginning of the summer, at his annual Google conference he demonstrated a model in motion and later, in November, it was known that Microsoft had also submitted a request to claim the corresponding patent.
However, from a conversation with the head of the 3D interactive technology group in the Cambridge Microsoft laboratory, Izadi Sharamom, it was clarified that for the scientists of the company, the glasses already belonged to a past stage.
They are attracted by the perspective of the manipulation of virtual objects in the air with bare hands and the creation of open virtual spaces.
- Please, in general terms, what is the object of your research group's study?
- We are dedicated to personal-computer interaction, but we also try to extend the limits of this interaction.
For now humanity in its great mass has been trapped in the working stage with the pixels on the flat screen, sometimes touching it with the finger.
But we want to look 5-10 years ahead and guess the cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors represent a step forward and today no Xbox is sold without Kinect, as everyone is interested in gesture control.
- What else does the future hold for us?
- Although Kinect has brought the interaction to the physical level, most of it still occurs on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The introduction of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is not yet very good.
We are trying to change this, we work on truly three-dimensional visualization systems based on different technologies, including design systems.
The world of computer science must be freed from our, our physicist, making it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also the space around him.
Then we can complete the real world with virtual objects in a more comfortable way.
First of all, to hell with those silly virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
A very popular detail, but don't you think they overestimate it?
- Of course you can't be considered a panacea, it's still about to solve the privacy issue, because you don't always want others to hear about our actions and intentions.
In fact, all kinds of interaction with computers are good, but each one in his own field.
For example, for the control of devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought of gestures, but not in loose movements, but shorter.
In addition, the gestures were captured not by the camera of the device, but by a bracelet that recorded the movement of the bones and muscles.
For now it is very large, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a bracelet clock.
But in general, the future is for a combined type of control, for example gesture + voice.
- How is that?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass this soda can?
You'll talk and show it at the same time.
- Usually I'm just talking.
- Oh, that's gonna be very hard to recognize.
- You mean, you want to force users to adapt to what the machine can or can't do right now?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual approach.
I believe that in the near future we will have to work mainly on the design of new types of sensors that can accurately determine the reactions of the person.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, as they provide a good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- If we talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what do you have complaints about modern cameras?
They lack resolution, depth or something else?
- In principle, the present generation is what can be the beginning of our work with three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at the speed of 1000 fps.
But the question is not in the megapixels, but in the quality of the matrix and in the depth.
From this last point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us; this gives more work to algorithm designers.
That is, we have to remember not only the resolution on the X and Y axes, but also in Z.
Speed is also important, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic and the currents of 30 fps are truly scarce, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our lab in Redmond, made a contact sensor with adjustable processing delay from 1 to 100 ms and it should be mentioned that modern serial produced sensors are closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands the extent to which this affects human-machine interaction.
It would be very useful to me for my work an equivalent of such a device, but that it does not require contact so that the tables per second are more.
- And you don't have to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is in fact the transmitter of infrared rays and the second one the receiver of the reflected signal.
But the third camera is actually a simple sensor of the visible slide.
This is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially, more cameras could solve the problem...
Or on the contrary, increase it and increase the required amount of calculations.
It would be good to create a flexible Kinect analog, play with the location curvature of the cameras and see how this would help determine the three-dimensional position.
- As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not presented its glasses to the public.
Does it not seem to you that, from the point of view of the daily use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most visible platforms?
- Of course, spending all the time holding up a smart phone in your hands, it's not very comfortable, but I think: the best option would be an increased "transmutable" reality when, based on a cloud platform, you could switch from glasses to smartphone,
Glasses are very personal devices, in which there is your strength (private things you can only see them), but also your weakness: an increased reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects along with other people.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only for Tony Stark of the movie "Iron Man", but also for any single mortal.
There is a problem in this idea that critics often point out: there is no tactile answer!
Hands don't feel anything!
What responses does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my conferences I often say that the increased reality is the seventh interruption in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth could be the addition of touch sensations.
Meanwhile, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as image support.
Record the touch perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are truly oriented to bring tangibleness to these "images in the air." For example, the interference of several ultrasonic rays directed at a specific point where the finger is located gives a feeling similar to that one feels if someone was blowing him in the finger buds, but that feeling is still very weak.
There are also wrist bracelets that influence the nerve endings of your fingers, which is also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to deceive the brain?
Make him think he feels what it looks like he should feel the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried yet.
Here is another challenge with which we will have to fight for a long time, how to make a person physically located in a very small space believes that it goes to an open space, almost endless. We are also working on the idea of running tapes (not like gyms), mobile platforms, as well as giant balloons.
For now, deceiving the brain is not so easy, it is still necessary to work for many years.
That is what makes working with virtual reality attractive to researchers, which many things are in a state of total conception.
Subjective personal taste in place of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "Vanguardism of St. Petersburg", dedicated to the citizens who are in front of it, at the forefront of art and culture.
In this list of the best are bright figures of the art and scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements reach beyond the city: they often find recognition in Europe without even knowing them.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed in red from above, to whom you can find near the Russian Museum, near the Summer Garden or in fashion meetings and openings.
Kirill Miller's paintings always attract crowds wherever they show themselves.
Kirill Miller is one of those purely socio-philosophical accountants of St. Petersburg, creators of new mythology.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of the vanguard of St. Petersburg in the late 1980s - early 1990s.
In addition, he is an urban man whose appearance on the streets of the city awakens in the smiling inhabitants and lifts everyone's mood.
Recently, he took an organ in his hands and became the organizer of St. Petersburg, as he has matured to make such a difficult role, for his existence Bohemia, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you going around town dressed in red and not yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose the red color because I'm a fashion designer and I'm dedicated to appearance and image.
In this world, red color is a commitment between the artist, image creators and society.
Although in society, anything other than a little gray provokes aggressiveness and agitation of properties nothing good.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to debate.
- When did you understand you were supposed to be an artist?
- In an exhibition at the Nevsky Palace of Culture, where my work was exhibited.
I realized that was my way.
Then the wave of unofficial old artists had ended, and the new ones, free like me, were still misunderstood.
I became friends with artists from the new wave, with those who were exposed in Gaza and Nevskiy, who led to "Pushkinskaya-10", and the new wave is over.
I went to the theater for clothes, music of all kinds, but not lyrics.
And all of this came together in your Art Clinic... it was important for me to find myself in the cultural center of St. Petersburg, where the best creative minds had to be gathered.
In 1995, I occupied a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while there were no reforms, there was a musical art club, a Bohemian club, the Bohemian house of St. Petersburg.
Many were born there: Noms, Tequila Jazz, I remember the way Schnur brought to the project "The ear of Van Gogh".
Schnur and his friends sang light songs under phonogram, wore tight pants, among them was the current fashion composer Igor Vdovin.
When the group started playing live, it became "Leningrado".
Trachtenberg was an animator of many programs before the times of Hali-galivskih.
We gave Trachtenberg and it was the beginning of his great career; basic education and training received it from us.
Gallery "D 137", the "Club Griboyedov", are the remains of the Art Clinic.
There were our employees and assiduous customers.
I'm a hero of the past century, when culture meant something.
In the year 2000, the survey was done in the press, the award was "The people of our city".
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" I was chosen, so my culmination ended.
In these new times it is not comfortable to work; I am a man who likes the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In our time it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are separated. One can be popular but very little cult.
- There's something recognizable in your work.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they clearly express the current and the occurrence.
I'm going to make a scheduled exhibition, "The Russian Museum in Clowns."
Clowns are a time-consuming category.
I used to be sociable, but now being so is painful and frightening.
But in clowns everything gets pregnant and tragedy is eliminated.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the salvation of the world through a totalitarian and compulsory change of clothing.
Now one follows it by the clothes, orienting externally, but not inside the person.
And maybe that person should not be given or given a hand, but spit on his face.
And the trick will be removed when you change clothes.
We saw you recently on the role of an urban planner.
Who better than me to be!
- Okay, but maybe commercial art can be beautiful?
- Now commercial art must be scrupulous, sweet, touchy.
We are witnessing the disintegration of cultures.
Before people gathered in herds, the Bohemians wanted one thing, the other simple ones.
Now everyone has been divided into microcommunities, it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar ticket to like everyone.
Now you have to think about who you want to like.
Now, every cult hero has his 100 fans.
- And to listen to Stas Mikhailov come for thousands!
- You'll see the abandoned ones, there's the sex-social sphere.
And to a cultural event there are 300 people, 10,000 will never come. As a result, less management, less money, everything is gone.
I have my fans, the most important thing is not to fool them, not to lose what you've achieved.
When he was young he made such paintings that a collector had hung them on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings, which people usually end with.
Now they often confuse concepts.
They say spiritual culture, culture of consumption.
There is no culture in consumption, that is another story.
I am a man of yesterday's culture, grew up under the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused money just to paint pictures.
I am in favour of this culture.
Kirill, what's missing from St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is a concept: a cultural official.
But not all of them can devote themselves to culture.
When the kings were the right ones everything was differently, the kings might not understand the culture very well, but they knew it was necessary to keep the right experts.
In Moscow there are now very good consultants.
We have people in St. Petersburg who might well be experts, but they're closed, because they need experts at a higher level that properly assess these and open their way.
He is now flourishing subjective personal taste.
The same is Errta, but the difference is that they honestly say that not all modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to look for other museums.
- What is it for you, St. Petersburg?
St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital. In Moscow there is much more culture, there is land.
But on our stones it is difficult for art to grow.
We need cultural ground and now we have more writers than readers, this is wrong.
In Europe there are a lot of people with curiosity who go to exhibitions and concerts.
In our case, this class is small.
We have to make art fashionable, as it did at the beginning of the last century.
The project will be implemented with a grant from St. Petersburg.
Give birth to space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or shock with a killer asteroid.
Spacecraft caravans with humans on board start in search of a replacement planet.
To preserve humanity, the main question is: How to continue the species in conditions of pregnancy or on the same replacement planet?
I think there's little to choose from.
In fact, only two are true planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically.
"These are Venus and Mars," says the chief researcher of the State Astronomical Institute, Sternberg P.K. (IAES), Vladimir Surdin.
But if conditions on Mars are better for life, on the surface of Venus the temperature is 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
Reproductive problems in space with flora began to be addressed.
Experiments with plants have been carried out for half a century.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit did not differ in any of the terrestrial varieties.
Then came the breed of insects in the orbit, small fruit flies, the drosophiles.
In 1979, codorniz eggs were sent to the space to check how the embryo develops in conditions of pregnancy.
We get a normal chicken as a result.
But then the problems begin.
"The problem is that this chicken has to find support, it must stay on its own feet and start moving," says Vladimir Sychev, the director of the Biomedical Problems Institute (IPBM) laboratory of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
When they found no support, the chickens gave rounds at random.
And after 10 hours in newborns a total atrophy of instincts was given.
Chickens did not react to light or sound.
And the misfortune was that after four days they just died.
"And twice we managed to get the chickens born, but then we left them because it was impossible to work there with them," says Vladimir Sychev about the failure of the experiment with the chickens in space.
The last time a biological "miniarch" flew into orbit was 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013 experiments will continue.
However, in the biosatellite "Bion" only species of the same sex will travel.
There was an experiment with rats, which were sent to space already with fetuses.
In principle, nothing supernatural was found.
"This was precisely in biosatellites, but this was a unique experiment, and studies like this should be carried out," says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the spatial rats had offspring.
However, the problem of reproduction directly in outer space has not yet been addressed.
It's a difficult challenge.
Animals, by losing their usual habitat, simply cannot perform their sexual instincts.
Man, however, unlike small animals, in principle can.
Homo sapiens has abstract reasoning and is able to create an appropriate emotional background.
Similar experiments are not carried out for ethical reasons.
But women have been travelling to space for 50 years now.
The biggest risk was Tereshkova.
And the most precious thing humanity has is the female organism.
Our seagull flying, and no one on Earth could say, if it's after a space flight.
You may or may not have a baby after this flight.
"After all, no one has answered this question," comments the veteran of the aerospace sector Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, only after a year of space flight, the first cosmonaut woman, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The girl's father, Andrian Nikolayev, was also cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second cosmonaut woman, Svetlana Savitskaya, who was twice in orbit and even worked in the open space, had a son.
However, the risk persists.
We are few, the astronauts are told who after long flights have all worked well, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if you can say more, it's dangerous even on orbital flights," sums up the cosmonaut pilot, hero of the Soviet Union, hero of Russia, Valery Polyakov.
However, humanity must look for some new ways in biotechnology, in radiological protection, in the creation of artificial gravity.
The hydrolaboratory of the Cosmonaut Preparation Centre is a mandatory stage in flight preparation.
Under zero float conditions, cosmonauts practice their working skills in space.
Water simulates pregnancy.
If for an adult water is a comfortable yet hostile environment, for a newborn child it is its birth element.
Small amphibian men seem to confirm that life on earth emerged from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is about 9 months inside her mother in the amniotic fluid, as it will be easier for her to get used to the water later.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth to the moment of the first bath only spend 2 weeks.
"This is very little to forget," says Marina Aksenova, a newborn swim monitor.
In short, if pregnancy is a more natural state for a newborn, gravitation is necessary for women, the force of gravity.
In pregnancy the abdominal and pelvis muscles are decrepit very quickly, the ejection capacity of the foetus is reduced.
Well, we skip that, trusting in the action of stimulants for delivery.
Of course, you can give birth in a special camera, it will push you.
"And then what?" Valeri Polyakov asks this original question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without the feeling of gravity, the body does not generate the skeleton or the muscle system.
A newborn in orbit is impossible to wear in a special training suit, such as adults.
He will simply be deprived of what is vital to him.
"And this experiment that we are going to do together, by allowing a child to be born in a strange environment, will lead us to bring to the Earth a disabled person, a totally unfit person," the head of the bioethics committee of the Institute of Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
For now, the birth of children in space is a theoretical issue.
However, in time this will be a reality, when human beings on their ships are directed to a distant planet that will be home to their children born in space.
Head of NKU: Inspection of the "švarc" system has not given to the guilty politician
With regard to public procurement, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and quality legislation, although its implementation is consistent.
This is what Miloslav Kala, vice president of the Office of Supreme Control (NKU) said in an interview for Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect," but its application must be correct. "This, in my opinion, is what we lack," describes the current situation.
Joint controls by Czech and German inspectors also reach similar conclusions.
As an example of an incorrect practice, he mentions the attitude of Petr Nečas towards the system of being autonomous only on paper, which is known as the "švarc" system.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS (Civic Democratic Party) would not bother businessmen with inspectors. So is it prohibited or allowed?
"The law must be regulated in some way and if it prohibits something, in that case, neither the president of the government can prevent the performance of the office that has an obligation to carry out such checks nor require obligations," says Kala.
At the meeting of the Committee on Control at the Congress of Deputies, you spoke about the joint project between the Czech and German teams, under which legislation on public procurement was compared in both countries.
What exactly is it?
It is a parallel control that we started to carry out about two years ago.
It was simplified: European legislation regulates how public procurement should be organised, this follows the legislation in force in each country and then praxis itself.
We have united everything and, although control has not yet been completed, we have obtained very interesting differences. Generally, our country's legislation is "stricter and more complete", however, the concrete practice in some parameters is better in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to incorporate increasingly strict rules, but it is necessary to concentrate on the application of the law itself.
What can this project actually bring about? What do you think the conclusions are?
It is precisely common control of this kind that could help us to stop investing efforts in law enforcement, reducing and improving limits, even if this does not have such a positive impact.
The economy of savings means getting something suitable at a reasonable price (which does not always mean that the price is the lowest) to avoid enrichment and, in the long run, criminal actions.
But not by reducing the limit of the invitations to tenders means that we are going to get it.
Perhaps because the system is saturated with so much "papeleo", that those who want to look for system failures can do it more easily than if the limits remained as high as now.
You talk about the problems of our country with the transfer of legislation regulating the practice of public procurement.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is it an office similar to our NKU or is it organized differently?
As for the offices, such as the NKU, there acts the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Court of Auditors), with an organization similar to ours, with a school too, the only thing is that in their case it is structured in a somewhat different way, but in principle both offices evolve parallelly.
The powers are also to some extent analogous, however, while Germany has a federal organization, the Courts of Auditors are even at this level.
The Federal Court of Auditors (BRH) can only control federal money, which we call state funds here.
Public funds, which are administered by regions and municipalities, are controlled by the Federal Court of Auditors there in Germany.
As far as local legislation is concerned, is it simpler than ours?
In general, I would not like to draw up a comparison without specific data. However, Germany remains a model in some respects, but it cannot be precisely stated in what is best.
Could it be better, for example, with regard to the quality of inspectors?
That's for sure not, but, I repeat, I don't like to make these kind of comparisons.
It must be said that even those countries that we take as a model must face a large number of problems.
If it weren't, they wouldn't have benefited from collaborating with our office, wouldn't it?
As regards the legislation of our country, what did the amendment of the law on public procurement mean for your Office? Is it in any way apparent its impact?
Given that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, it has not yet been manifested in the control proceedings.
Since we carry out ex post checks, we need to have a certain delay.
For now, it is seen in the process of preparing future controls: we have initiated a new tool for "non-economic risk detection", whereby we have released almost 14,000 public awards, which have been analysed. The changes will be perfectly reflected here, as the limits are modified, the conditions of some types of the selection process are rectified and similar.
Do you consider the adoption of this law to be beneficial or rather a blunder for the bureaucratic system?
I think this law is certainly a step in the right direction and I hope so.
The problem that may arise is that the regulations "harden" and that it is impossible to comply with it.
Already with the previous legislation, controlled persons were linked to the contractor (e.g. in the case of regional operational programmes of the regional council), and every law not respected in the matter of public procurement meant a violation of budgetary discipline.
Does it then make sense to harden the law this way?
I don't think so.
The system should exclude those who want to attack or take advantage of it and not punish those who make a formal decision, which has no impact on decision-making.
Such a system will only create greater bureaucratic pressure.
And how do you get out of this?
We'll see where this path leads us.
The Prime Minister recently stated that the SDG would not bother entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called švarc system, with reference to being autonomous only on paper. What does this mean?
Is the švarc system forbidden or allowed?
The law must be regulated in some way and, if it prohibits anything, then even the Prime Minister of the Government cannot prevent the performance of the Office that has an obligation to carry out such checks and require obligations.
You can say, "We change the law and allow it," but you can't say that we'll do as if nothing.
In the Public Procurement Act, the regulation is quite strict as to how formal action should be taken, and that is how it should be to protect public competition.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic that the candidate should be excluded with the best offer not to meet the formal requirements.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct. This, in my opinion, is what we lack.
Roads have ice plates, although most of them are passable
In several places in the Czech Republic, the roads feature ice and snowboards.
Although most of the routes are transitable, caution must be exercised in some cases.
Karlovy Vary Region
Today morning the roads in the Karlovy Vary region were transitable, but presented ice and snowboards.
The temperature drops and will fluctuate between five and ten degrees below zero. During the day the thermometers will rise slightly.
It has stopped snowing in the region and in the low areas the snow layer is thin.
On the other hand, in the ridges of the Metallic Mountains the snow reaches almost 30 centimeters.
In some places visibility was still bad due to fog, according to information from the Regional Road Operations Control Centre.
Quick route R6 and first-class road in the region are now transitable without restrictions.
However, it is recommended to extreme caution, especially in some bridges whose surface may be frozen and slippery.
In addition, all second- and third-class routes, including mountain roads, are also passable.
However, in some of them there are still traces of frozen ice and snow.
Attention needs to be increased on the road, especially in the highest areas.
Pardubice and Hradec Kralové region
On some roads in East Bohemia there is danger of frost and in higher areas and in the mountains a snow layer may have been formed on the roads, reports on its pages the Road and Highways Directorate.
Road workers warn drivers of the danger of ice plates being formed, especially in higher areas of the Pardubice region.
Ice can occur in the vicinity of Lanškrouna, Ústí nad Orlicí, Poličky, Svitav or Vysokého Mýta, and especially on the second and third category roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34 in Svitav have been treated chemically.
There is snow especially on the roads of the mountains of Krkonoše to Orlické Hory.
There is a snow layer in the highest areas of the roads in the municipalities of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In the area of eastern Bohemia, the sky will be today between clear and partially cloudy, without precipitation.
Temperatures will usually fluctuate between three below zero and one positive degree, a weak wind will blow.
Region of Pilsen
The roads in the Pilsen region can be transported today in the morning, although caution must be exercised and it will be necessary to adapt to time.
In the early hours of the morning there will be frosts, temperatures will fluctuate between three and nine degrees below zero.
After the snow and the subsequent decrease in temperatures, some tracks could also be covered with ice.
In some places drivers will encounter fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is from the information of the Regional Road Operations Control Centre.
The D5 motorway is transitable almost without restrictions, although it is recommended to extreme precaution, especially on the route between 80 and 131 km.
The surface of most of the first category roads is dry and ice-free.
In the area of the road of Pilsen and Tachov border with Germany there may be sections with ice plates.
The second and third category routes are wet, so in this case it is also warned of sections with ice plates.
Drivers should be more cautious, especially in the less transit routes in the Šumava area.
Olomouc Region
Drivers headed to the highest areas in the Olomouc region will be partially unscathed.
After the chemical treatment, it still snowed in the port of Červenohorské and on the road towards Videlský kříž.
Road workers took off the snow during the night; on the road of Šumper accumulated about three centimeters of snow, according to road managers.
In the rest of the region, most roads are transitable without restrictions.
"In the highest areas of Šumper road, snow remains.
Drivers in the port of Červenohorské will meet with half-dissolved snow towards Jeseník," confirmed today a operator of the road administration from Šumper to the ČTK.
On the ground and at night they also came to the Jesenická colleagues and, after chemical treatment, the tracks of the highest areas are now clear and wet.
On the Olomouc road the roads are transitable without restrictions, in that of Šternberská drivers should drive cautiously in the forest sections, where the roads continue to be wet.
Region of Ustí nad Labem and region of Liberec
North Bohemian road operators have reported on complications in different sections at first thing in the morning.
Apart from some places where it has snowed or frozen, according to the police database the mountain road between Telnice and Knínice in the region of Ústí nad Labem is closed.
The temperatures are kept below zero, even in the lower areas, so the ice and snow obviously remain on the pavement. However, in the lower areas, especially in the southeast of the Central Czech Mass, there are no problems and the roads are usually dry.
No service complications have been recorded for the memo.
Road operators have warned of the presence of ice in the vicinity of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, conditions have been ideal during the night. During the day rain and snow are expected to melt and at night the sky will be clear and there will be ice.
Since the general roads, unfavourable conditions have been announced on road I/13, on the border between the region of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec.
The road between Telnice and Kninice had to be cut off by the branches of the trees that had been arched on the track with the weight of the snow.
Šimon Ornest: At our concerts we want to build positive energy
It is said that within less than a month the end of the world will come, what do you think?
It's just one of so many other alarmist news that we like to catch up with.
The Tap Tap music group prefers to make jokes about this and we like to say that we are the only music group in the world who can gather enough positive energy to postpone the end of the world or to avoid it.
In addition, in December you will organize a truly original project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you explain it to our readers?
This is a state benefit that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential at the end of the May calendar set out at 11:10 a.m. on December 21.
The day before, on December 20 at 21 p.m., we will hold 3 simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end at approximately the same time as the Mayan calendar ends on Kiribati Island, in the Pacific Ocean, 12 hours in front of our time zone.
Who did this idea happen to?
Initially it was my idea, then we went forging the project together with our designer Honza Augusta.
In addition to wanting to gather enough positive energy and avoid the end of the world, we also want to reflect, together with society, on the state in which we will leave the world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar we have also created a unique collection of articles: boots, t-shirts, bags and original keys against the end of the world that can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz, another way to support us.
The Tap Tap group, along with other interpreters, also sang the so-called anthem against the end of the world, which is titled "End of the World, Cancelled".
It is currently very popular on YouTube, can you hear at the benefit concerts?
Of course it is, and it will be just the last, well, as long as everything goes well and the world doesn't end...
All interpreters will sing it at the same time at the three concerts.
The hymns will be linked simultaneously thanks to the special live broadcast on Czech Television.
Tomáš Hanák has written the lyrics of this song and plays the protagonist role of Jesus in the music video, where he also sings Xindl X...
How did this collaboration come about?
We work together even with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, apart from organizing many beneficial acts and concerts...
Let us make every effort to participate in this project.
It has been shown that most of them are interested and have fun working with us.
What will the money collected in the concerts against the end of the world be used for?
A equipment for the educational center without Studeo barriers, which we completed in its sixth consecutive year with the civil association Tap in Jedličkčv usitav.
The students of the Jedličkčv school usetav are regularly visited by teachers with whom they engage in fun and interesting activities.
Students do not have enough economic means to pay teachers and we make an effort to make it possible.
Within the framework of the completion of the works at Jedličkčv usutav, there will be an independent building to which we will move with this project.
Several groups and interpreters act at each concert.
What are the selection criteria?
We are trying to develop a programme that is attractive to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague will act Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan Barta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
For more detailed information, please visit www.kpks.cz.
Do you have any other similar "wonderful action" planned in the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at the Pražské jaro festival, so here we will certainly prepare an attractive program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to play at the Bohemian National Hall in New York and myself personally, taking advantage of us in the United States, I would like to complete it with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your plans abroad are not exactly minimalist, so far you have acted for example in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group made up of persons with disabilities.
How is the logistics and organization of these trips?
It's not as difficult as it may seem at first sight.
There are five members in electric wheelchairs, chairs must travel in the luggage compartment and we also carry a lot of weight, boxes with instruments...
However, so far we have managed well. ČSA and British Airways were perfectly prepared, which still surprises me.
Even in Moscow, where we recently returned, everything went smoothly.
Thanks to the departures abroad you can compare the different attitudes of society towards the disabled and other aspects.
What have you met so far?
In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities everything works better than here; in Russia we have witnessed that in the east there is a long way to go.
Unlike Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, there is still no frequent that a person moves alone through the city centre in an electric wheelchair.
Something as common as it is, for example, give preference to someone in wheelchairs in elevator, there it is not.
Fortunately, a civil partnership has been established that is endeavouring to address the problems of persons with disabilities.
In what areas should we take the example of more developed countries?
There's a lot of things we're going behind...
But it is important to mention that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the people to whom it directly affects.
In London and Madrid it is very normal that people with severe disabilities move on their own in public and can go to the service, to the museum, wherever they want...
But it is not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to participate actively in social life, in this respect, with The Tap Tap we go a little ahead!
A respectful or barrier-free society is one thing, but when the time comes when eminent sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers will start to change everything really.
So far, these are isolated cases of people who have a great strength of will.
The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, but if we look a few years ago, what led you to form the group in 1998?
I entered as an educator at Jedličkänustav, where there were many young people around me who wanted to dedicate themselves to something.
And since I'm a musician, I play, among others, the saxophone, I founded an amateur group with a workmate.
And over time, as our moderator La Ça Angelovič says, we left a little out of our hands (Laughter).
However, popularity hasn't reached until the last few years, or am I wrong?
It is true that it helped us quite enough to connect with famous singers and also to work actively to promote the group.
We come to the conclusion that the work that is not seen is as if it did not exist.
Thanks to the support of the European Union, we can also allow ourselves to teach quality, equipment, etc.
Did you intend to get so far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning I saw the potential there was, that something can be done differently.
The world of the show is full of things that look like each other.
It is logical, in its way, that everything new is welcomed with caution and takes a long time to accept it.
There are few extraordinary things, but I dare say that The Tap Tap is one of them.
The impression of someone who sees us for the first time is clearly compassion, it's a natural reaction...
But compassion is completely superfluous because people with disabilities are not abandoned beings who suffer and who we should have compassion for.
There are people who are able to live a full life and develop, with the condition, of course, that they have the necessary means.
I always say that if something goes well for people with disabilities, then it is not just a step forward for them, but for society as a whole.
Did it help the fact that you're a demanding boss, as many people describe you?
If we want to do quality work, we must be rigorous in many respects and demand certain discipline.
I think it's completely normal.
Some people arrive with a romantic vision and head in the clouds, and when they learn that they have to go two days to practice, go to the preparatory test and spend a lot of time traveling and in concerts, the initial euphoria abandons them quickly.
But that's how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and get something.
The Tap Tap group currently has twenty members.
How many of them were already at the beginning of 1998?
Only one: There is Angelovič.
We're an open group, people come in and out, you can't help it.
Whoever has will and desires will always find the open doors
It will be the day before the expected end of the world, Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21 a.m.
It will take place in the Incheba Arena of Prague, in Fléda de Brno and in Plynojem in Ostrava and will participate 12 groups and other musicians of the Czech Republic
The three cities will be connected at the end of the evening through videoconferencing to sing together the song of the group The Tap Tap "End of the world, cancelled"
The aim of the concert is to gather the necessary resources to finance multifunctional equipment of the educational centre without STUDEO barriers in Jedličkčv usutatav in Prague, whose cost is 25 million Czech crowns.
The entrance to the concert costs 400 CZK and children up to 12 years have free entry in the early sale option in Bohemiaticket
Poland and the cosmos.
At the meeting of Ministers of the European Space Agency countries held last week, Poland was accepted as a twelfth member of ESA. It is the second member country of ESA of the former bloc of Eastern Europe, after the Czech Republic, which became a full member on 12 November 2008.
Poland began intense collaboration with ESA in 1994 and during subsequent years participated in the Agency's project commission.
However, Poland's path to the cosmos began a long time ago.
Polish enthusiasts were already engaged in space flights before World War II, although their work was not always understood.
I remember, for example, the conference of A. Šternfeld at the Warsaw astronomical observatory in which, on 6 December 1933, he presented his ideas on the pioneer study "Introduction to Cosmonautica".
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the assistants indifferent and, years later, Šternfeld recalled that Dr. Jan Gadomski had been the only one who had shown interest in his work.
In 1934 Šternfeld won in France the Robert Esnault-Pelterie award and André Louis Hirsch for his "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned earlier, later became a great promoter of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a series of books dedicated to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a promoter of cosmonautics, he was known all over the world and his contribution to science was rewarded when his name was named one of the craters on the hidden face of the moon.
As early as 1925, a drain was built in Poland and was to be supplied with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, it is not known who was the author of the proposal and neither are the details of the project known.
It is not clear whether the rocket was going to be used for the start of the dresin or for its braking.
Information on this drain is limited to the collection in the press of the time.
From 1933 the Polish artillery began to dedicate itself to missiles.
The research was funded by Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and Prof. Gustavem Mokrzyckiegim.
From the preserved material, it is evident that the investigation came to the stage of practical testing.
However, with the arrival of the German troops, the investigation was discontinued.
In 1937 the prototype of a photoelectric hunting missile designed by engineer Rohoziński appeared in the specialized press and the following year the study "Rakieta - torpeda powiettrzna and rakietomba lotnicza" by author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki was published.
Both projects were intended for military use of missile engines.
Shortly before the war, the Interim Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Doradczo-Naukowy) was responsible for all draft missile techniques for military use and coordinated all work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, it was interrupted by the beginning of the war.
Other studies dedicated to cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautica (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
In the November 1954 issue of Problemy magazine, reference is made for the first time to society with four very extensive articles dedicated to astronomy.
In one of them, Professor M. Subotowicze proposed the creation of a society that would be dedicated to cosmonautics.
At that time artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was obvious that cosmic research was a discipline with prospects for the future.
Since early 1956 the Polish Society of Astronautics (PTA) had aspired to be part of the International Federation of Astronautics (founded in 1951) and in the fall of that same year the PTA became a full member.
The following year the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became the vice president of the International Federation of Astronautics.
He served this post until his death in 1959.
Starting in 1956, the PTA participated significantly in the development of the RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna) probe, which was a success and became the first Polish rocket in which scientific research was carried out.
The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957 and launched for the first time on 10 October 1958.
The rocket had a height of 1,800 meters, about 80 cm in length and did not reach 5 kg in weight.
Later, the RM-1A version was completed, and in the summer of 1959 the two-stage RM-2 rockets air trials were started in the Błędów desert.
The rocket was 1.4 meters long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another type of developing rocket was going to be the subject of real scientific study. The RM-34 rocket was going to have a peak of 14.5 km and its mission would be to control the high wind.
However, in 1962 the work was suspended.
The successor of the first RM rockets was the Meteor-1 rocket, which was built during 1962 and 1965.
It was designed as a two-step rocket with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which differed from each other by the space available for scientific devices.
In the Meteor-1A rocket the available space for the volume was 0.4 litres, in the Meteor-1B of 0.34 litres and in the Meteor-1C of 0.62 litres.
The maximum peak in the three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Air Institute, whose first air tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a useful weight of 10 kg up to 60 km in height.
Subsequently, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 version was built.
It is also necessary to mention Poland's entry into the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the formation of the national committee of COSPAR two years later.
Within the framework of the Interkosmos programme, Poland joined the research of the cosmic space on Soviet artificial satellites and, in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
The suspension of the Social Work Act is not the solution.
Last week, the constitutional court suspended the social work law.
The resolution sparked a heated discussion in society.
It will certainly be interesting to examine the existing problem from a broader perspective.
Liberal economic systems in the EU, as in the globalised world, are based on the principle of greater economic competition and less regulation.
Consequently, this means that the different economic forms and national economic systems are in permanent conflict with each other.
The cause is found in the principle of free trade and the free and unlimited movement of private capital, together with unbridled financial speculation.
The effect of major differences in labour costs (wages) produces economic tensions.
Under this concept it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, with the import of cheap goods, tries to shorten distances and to do so "causes a decrease" of the competitor's price in order to achieve most of the market and thus increase its profit margin.
On a large scale it means, for most entrepreneurs, moving production abroad, buying there cheaper or disappearing. The result is high unemployment in those countries where the price of labour, compared to other economies, is higher.
Because private capital has no social responsibility and thus is not responsible for the unemployment generated by this phenomenon, the social expenditure of the state necessarily increases.
All this is conducive to employers' total disinterest in paying taxes and compensating for the economic and social damage they have caused in their pursuit of profits.
The situation is so universally known that there is no need to present specific statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital create situations, in certain economies, in which the Governments of those countries are obliged to compete with the objective of artificially reducing the social level of the population itself and thus attracting foreign capital to the country.
In other words, Governments make private capital available to their own population without taking into account the social decline.
This is especially evident in the changes in existing laws.
The aim is to force the population to accept the dictatorship of private capital, especially with regard to wages.
This takes place, on the one hand, through the system of economic obligation in the case of long-term unemployment; on the other, through the restricted right of employees to labour rights.
The result is a growing poverty along with the increase in the gap between the poor and the rich.
For a number of years, food delivery points have been in Germany for poor people who cannot keep up with their own work.
The number of people receiving this kind of help is already up to the million.
As part of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, there is a very common case: people employed with such a low wage that the state must pay the rest to reach the minimum essential to survive.
A scandal of this kind was reported in connection with the situation of auxiliary employees of the German federal parliament.
The savings measures of virtually all the states in the south of the EU undoubtedly lead to the same situation. People, pressured by an abysmal decline of their social level, are forced to emigrate as in the 19th century or to suffer a bad wage within the limits of society, with the hope that someday they will reach the private investor capital country.
Do you have to wonder where he's from?
In the case of other EU countries, then poverty goes from country to country or never arrives, as Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian or African continue to work for a small part of a European wage.
This also affects all Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media claim until the satiety that the state should not bring capital to the economy, which directs the economy to its failure.
Private capital defends with nails and teeth the thesis that the state should not intervene in the economy by getting into control.
Next, it is necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence the political march with its selfishness and, therefore, throughout the state.
In this case, the answer is clearly yes.
The test is the existence of lobbies, in practice very powerful and omnipresent, in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, in mutual favours, in legislation that is practically reprehensible everywhere but not punishable.
In Germany the situation is as follows: State ministries, in the absence of financial means, are responsible for drafting bills to private legal enterprises, which are often linked to industry.
This type of bill is subsequently passed in the Bundestag, the German parliament.
Thus, all power emanates not from the people, as announced in the constitutions of Western democracies, but from the strong financial groups representing their own interests.
It is obvious that democracies with a liberal orientation are rapidly in a situation as the one described Appianos in his work The crisis of the Roman Republic in the days of Caesar and Pompeii: "The state took time to disintegrate and the administrations occupied themselves with force."
In exchange for bribes, favors obtained unlawfully and aid to finance stones or swords.
Bribe and corruption spread unimpeded and people came to the polls with the pre-fabricated vote"... "there were no people in a position to aspire to a position in the administration, so once, because of this disorganization, the state was eight months without consuls"... "It began to be serious that the only remedy for such a grave situation was autocracy and that it was necessary to choose an energetic man"... Although Appianos thought of Pompeii, Caesar went up to power and turned democracy forever into autocracy.
The conclusion, in the same way as in old age, is that the current society is based on unconsidered preferences of individual benefit without taking account of common interests.
Private capital is, in its essence, unable to understand and claim the benefits of the entire society.
The result is the same as that of then, a decadence of the unprecedented elite, without an effort being made to reform it in depth.
The causes of the rise of fascist and communist regimes must therefore be sought in the unbridled liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
With respect to the current situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of a liberal-style democracy, as a definite break, pending the next coup.
The really crushing fact is that the present elite completely ignores the losses of hundreds of thousands of lives, social and humanitarian catastrophes we have witnessed, as well as crimes against humanity, as we know them in ancient and most recent history.
The suspension of the Public Procurement Act is not the solution; at least not in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both internationally and within the EU, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek other ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution goes through concrete socio-political reforms, which reinforce both the participation of state capital and the influence of citizens in government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: The Chaos Laboratory.
"That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever couldn't arise from violence and nothing could do it," Sting in his song Fragile and whose stipend prays "Let's do not forget how fragile we are" (let's not forget how fragile we are).
"If my children didn't want wars, there wouldn't be any" Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, on his deathbed in 1849.
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, various reactions have emerged, as always.
One, on the side of Israel, argues in favour of the right of self-defense and encases the Palestinians in the role of terrorists; the other supports the Palestinians and claims racism on the part of the State of Israel, genocide perpetrated against Palestinian Arabs and stains Israel as a terrorist state.
I do not want to focus on who is guilty of the killings that are repeated periodically and who is the victim. After all, the citizens of today Israel, including the autonomous territories, were born within the current political situation and did not live the beginnings of violence.
My intention is to offer readers a look behind the curtain, a look to find out who benefits from the tensions that have been dragging for 95 years (calculated from the Balfour declaration in November 1917) on a small land area of the Middle East.
Some of my considerations are based on historical facts, others on conclusions that I have come to on the basis of my own understanding of the matter, on whom or which group of people is the main driver of modern history's events.
In the history of mankind, the history of power struggles is at the forefront.
At every age we can find a Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
But what is no longer so obvious is whether it was always these characters who led their steps autonomously or if there was someone behind their throne who directed their actions towards a certain goal.
We must accept that we live in an era that concentrates the wealth of the world on the hands of a few individuals and that to this concentration of money and the power that this implies, it has not been possible to reach one generation.
Of these astronomically rich families, one that could be considered the most prominent (if there is still someone behind it, I don't know, but I don't discard it): the Rothschilds.
Not much is written near them.
Of course.
In the 90s of the 19th century they bought the first news agency (Reuters) to stop associating their name with very serious criminal acts. Power and wealth, or both, covered their backs, which for them always meant a strengthening.
They have significant stakes in almost all central banks in the world and in those countries where they are not represented, a war has been declared or is being prepared: before the attack on Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the Iraq attack there were 5, after defeating Gadafi there were only four, but in the meantime Russia has subordinated the central bank to the Russian government.
Everyone who has tried to oppose this family has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the state of the Central Bank of America of the Rothschild, began during the Secession War to print money and was murdered in 1865 at the theatre.
JFK started printing money and wanted to suspend the federal reserve system (FED) and was killed in 1963; Congressman Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after wanting to sue the EDF for having triggered the great economic crisis of 1929.
His zeal for world power led them during the years 1859 - 1871 to draw a plan with three world wars, designed by Mason Albert Pike, decorated with grade 33.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great monarchic states throughout Europe; the second wanted to eliminate colonial supremacy, especially in Britain, and the third intended to reduce the population of the earth between half a million and one billion people (like slaves for their well-being and luxury would suffice and not consume so much resources), in addition to the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing but a preliminary draft for such a solution) and the definitive adoption of absolute powers.
The method by which the group of the richest families, along with the Rothschilds, operates follows the dynamics of the triggering crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution (order ab cao - order from chaos).
These solutions are, however, wrong, and always lead to a worsening of the situation. Otherwise, it is enough to remember that the EDF was created so that a crisis like the year 1907 would not be repeated.
So, after the success of the assassination of the heir to the Austrian-Hungarian throne, Francis Fernando, in Sarajevo and after the outbreak of World War I, they destroyed the Tsarist Russia with the beginning of the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended suddenly and unjustifiedly from a military and economic point of view, Germany's capitulation (wars to end the Tsarist Russia were already unnecessary) and the subsequent dismemberment of the great power of Central Europe, the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
In order to prepare the ground for World War II, they allowed bankers and politicians to create, in a covert manner, a conflict following the enormous war repairs imposed on Germany, thereby creating the optimal conditions for the radicalization of the impoverished masses. Subsequently, they were sufficient to serve the Germans the solution of the Führer, which was strong and simple enough and pointed to the perpetrators, and then to build a Czechoslovakia composed of several nationalities with a strong German minority that should represent and represent so well the function of the fifth column, which seized the flame and provoked the outbreak of the war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschild promoted the foundation of the Zionist movement, a branch that aspired to the formation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of ancient Judea with Jerusalem as capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour declaration mentioned above laid the groundwork for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine and started the first conflicts with the Arab population in the area.
Terrorist attacks were carried out on both sides.
World War II broke out: it is difficult to know whether Hitler drew too much from the rope the international bankers had attached to at first or if everything he did was part of a plan. However, the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the optimal conditions for accepting the Jewish state in world society.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, similarly to the way in which the war repairs imposed on Germany paved the way for World War II, with the proclamation of the State of Israel the focus for a third war was created.
If international bankers managed to start it, the Jewish nation, as in World War II, would become a victim in the first line of combat, now with the Arab population or, generally, a Muslim in the Middle East.
Israel is a huge laboratory, a welding machine and chaos, not only within its country, but also internationally. Let us take as an example how Israel's supporters and detractors are being taxed.
Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict? Where injustice breeds injustice in a spiral of endless violence, if at the beginning of all was the greed of some individuals and their zeal for world power?
At this point it is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their representatives, because, as is the case in our country, international bankers only present their candidates in the elections.
The current President of Israel B. Netanyahu is the typical example of a fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, who makes every effort to declare war on Iran and, considering Iran is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to become a global conflict and, if we take into account that Iran controls the Ormuz Strait, where 20% of all world oil passes (the navigation corridor is only two miles wide), would lead to the destruction of the world economy.
Under what light are now shown the words spoken by David Rockefeller in 1994: "All we need is a general crisis and people will be in accordance with a new world order."
The new world order in your imagination is a world of lords and slaves.
A world where the rest of the population serves a handful of people who are part of the well-accommodated financial aristocracy.
A world in which every new individual is implanted a chip at birth that controls all his being.
"And forces all, small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves, to have a mark in the right hand or front, to be unable to buy or sell, unless they bear the name of this monster or the figures of his name.
It is necessary to understand it: whoever has two fingers in front of him, to add the numbers of this monster.
The number marks the person and this number is sixty-six."
Argo Film: If it gets raw, call Hollywood
In November 1979 a group of Islamist students protest took over the American embassy in Tehran and took 52 graduates as hostages.
His release was to be in exchange for the dethroned Shah Mohamed Réza Páhlevi, who fled to the United States after the revolution, a country that had sponsored his regime for decades.
For the American administration, the situation did not offer any positive prospects: to throw the shah on the edge could not be allowed, since, if it did, it would jeopardize the trust of its allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had led to the constitution of the theocratic regime, was not within its reach.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which later intensified further with the failed attempt to free the hostages by force.
The diplomats in prison were released 444 days after the Algerian government's negotiating intervention.
In the United States, his fate caused a wave of solidarity and enthusiasm against Iran.
The failure in Iran contributed decisively to Jimmy Carter's defeat against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film "Argo" by the director and actor Ben Affleck talks about an episode of this story, which reaped a small success for America.
Shortly before occupying the embassy, six employees escaped from the building.
After a complicated periple, they ended up in the residence of the Canadian Embassy.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, helped a history covered by an extravagant point: they went out with Canadian passports, as members of the film team that examined the location in the country for the shooting of a science fiction superproduction.
Gender Combination
The plan by the expert on "exfiltration" Toni Mendez required Hollywood collaboration.
To make the lie appear true, it was written about the film project in specialized journals, press conferences were organized, the fictional production society even had a real office.
Details about the operation remained secret for a long time, the film has been made from Tony Mendez's memories.
Affleck's film is a unique combination of various genres.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller; on the other, a so-called "caper movie", the story of an episode that went well, a deception (an example can be the Ocean's Eleven series).
The film combines the mood states. We found well-documented sequences of Tehran on the one hand. In the sequence of credits, emblematic photographs of the time of events are shown, which were equally portrayed in the film; there are not many differences in this respect.
On the other hand, typical scenes of Hollywood a little lighter, marked by irony and a slight exaggeration.
And also, scenes from the CIA central and other institutions: men brought along who analyze the situation at the negotiating table, in the corridors of the office, by telephone...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in an excellent way.
The actor, who had been ridiculed, has become a respectable director and his way of acting has ceased to be the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film, after "Goodbye Small, Goodbye" (2007) and the thriller "The Town. City of Thieves" (2010).
At the same time, it is Affleck's first film in which action does not take place in the city of Boston, where it grew up.
Also, the sensitivity to capture the atmosphere of the place was a characteristic that placed old movie directors above Hollywood standards.
And Affleck shows it in Argo, where Tehran is "wheeled" in Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place on the streets, in the reconstruction of the true events. The introductory sequence of the embassy's take is impressive due to its synoptic capacity which, at the same time, conveys the emotion of uncertainty and the lack of foresight that arises when, somewhere, history takes a step forward.
Affleck and his collaborators get a similar effect on the fictional scenes (the imposter team in the Tehran bazaar).
Too many actions in too many places
The director had to accept the fact that an explained story does not offer much in the cinematographic sense of the most intriguing scenes.
And it is quite well arranged. Sometimes it adds something to reality: here it doesn't all come out so elegantly (the scene in which the crisis at Tehran airport blinds, the diversion of a call to America and the unbridled search after its track becomes crazy).
Argo's weakness is the lack of control that arises from the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman have a very funny role as Hollywood collaborators, although their characters deserve more space and are not, much less, the only ones in this film.
For these reasons, Affleck's film loses a bit of dramatic trait, but it's a film that can be followed with a moderate interest, value its realization and retro style of a thriller that evokes the 1970s.
But if it breaks down, that'll be hard.
As evocation of a real history and as proof of the exaggerated that may be the notions of omnipresence and omniscience of secret services, it is sufficient.
Rules for inflation of balloons, bananas and circuses
The www.bankovnipoplatky.com server, which presents a survey every year on the most absurd banking fees, has now decided to announce the competition on "the most absurd regulation or ideas of the EU workshop".
"It happened to us after the last event, the EU plans to approve a share of 40% of women in leading positions in large European companies," said Provo Patrik Nacher, the organizer of the survey.
Among the absurdities nominated is, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify insurance policies between men and women.
Until now, women had a better price in life insurance because they objectively represent a lower risk.
"Other amazing ideas of the EU workshop can be proposed by people until the end of this year."
The election will take place at the end of February 2013," Nacher said.
Among the controversial EU regulations are, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to fuel that, as a result, damages the environment; another prohibition is the use of mercury thermometers throughout life only because they contain a small amount of a dangerous substance or the dark guideline the size of chicken cages, which has contributed to the considerable increase in egg prices this year.
The factual prohibition of using the term "untar mangrove" or the withdrawal of the classic commercial bulb has been criticized.
A quality banana must have a length of 14 cm.
The Union apparatus often makes such decisions under the pressure of one or another commercial or industrial lobby, whose requests in Brussels are normally defended by some state or group of states (the Czech Republic, even with the threat of veto, claims the demands of its banks).
The interests of a lobby were behind the request, for example, that the highest quality bananas should have an EU length of at least 14 cm and could not present "abnormal curvatures".
The European Commission argued that this only seeks to harmonise un homogenised national standards so far, which only complicate their marketing.
The rules referring to fruit and vegetables in the EU, despite the opposition of some states, have been softened on the basis that the existing directive leads to waste of edibles.
The candidate for winning the survey could be the EU prescription last year that in the inflatable balloons marketed it is mandatory to warn that children under the age of 8 are not allowed to inflate them without adult supervision.
The EU referred here to an American study that, when talking about toys, balloons are the main cause of infant death by asphyxiation.
There is also a similar restriction applicable to the use of massasugras by children up to 14 years of age.
Curious occurrences are born even in our country
Equally absurd is the regulation on European officials: anyone who has an official role in the EU cannot use the name of Macedonia. In order not to harm Greece's sensitivity, it must be referred to FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankovnípoplatky.com server, in collaboration with the association of liberal economists Laissez Ferie, named in the survey, among some absurd proposals mentioned above, the Union prescription on the volume of food supplies in the territory of a Member State.
The EU determined the maximum volumes of food supplies that can be found on the territory of the Czech Republic on the same day of our entry into the EU.
Subsequently, the Czech Republic exceeded, for example, the volume established for canned mushrooms, which posed a threat of substantial fine.
The organizers of the survey were also interested in the occurrence of paying those countries that did not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a subsidy for the application for grants.
Such ideas did not appear in Brussels but in Prague.
"We're at a disadvantage because we don't have a sea.
We call on the European Union for compensation," declared the then Minister for Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in autumn 2004.
He argued with the fact that much grain was produced in our country and, as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, the state had the warehouses full and had to be exported.
According to Palas, since the Czech Republic is far from seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
In the end, the European Commission demonstrated its willingness to assist the Czech Republic and organised a public tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The grant to receive a grant was proposed to municipalities by the Ministry for Local Development led by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU). Specifically, it is intended for the drafting of applications for grants in Brussels.
EU: Rare requirements are an exception
The Member States' guidelines are often critical, the EU's regulatory efforts and also more effective functioning and development across the Union deserve our recognition, according to a number of experts.
According to experts, the most serious problem is, for example, the collection of EU grants for projects which have nothing to do with deepening European integration, but which Member States have achieved in the budget negotiations.
The Czechs are also concerned with the sensitive fibre, in the same way as other EU countries, with the struggle for the right to the designation of origin of their traditional products, although our country has not always come out victorious of these fists.
The Czechs, after six years of dispute with Germans and Austrians, successfully defended the designation of origin of the Olomouc petition, but had to change its name to the national rum, whose tradition in our country dates back to the 19th century, and became called "tuzemak".
Only products made from sugar cane distillate can be called rum, but not those made from sugar beet.
In the official list of protected designations of origin of the EU, together with known feta and gorgonzola cheeses worldwide, the apple of the German city Lübeck or Parma ham, are already found, for example, the biscuits of Karlovy Vary, the carp of Pohořelice and Třeboň and, even, the variety of hops of Žatec.
As protected seas of the EU, they can be proud of Pardubice ginger bread and the boats of Hořice v Podkrkonoší.
People want me to save the republic, but I'm a fan, Okamura says
Mr. Senator, how did it happen to you to present yourself to the presidential elections?
It's not about being a senator or president.
If everything was all right in our country, then I wouldn't apply.
But I can no longer stand to see how stolen in the last twenty years in our country, how thieves get unpunished, taxes and retirement age increase.
I had no ambitions to be a politician.
When I see something that I don't like, I try to find a solution to change it.
And since I am 40 years old and my candidacy is independent, the only chance I have to change things is to present myself as a senator or president.
The Senate has already arrived, but soon thereafter it has set foot on its way to the presidency.
Aren't you turning your back on those people who voted for it?
I always said that my candidacy to the presidency depended on the results in the Senate elections.
Later I needed to say that if I was elected as a senator, I would present my candidacy to the presidency.
But my goal is not the function; the function is the tool with which I can make my own ideas come true.
That is why I need the greatest possible influence and the strongest possible mandate.
The problem is not only that we are a nation that we criticize in the bar or in front of television, but rather we trample on anyone who wants to start a change.
This is added to the media, which depresses and confuses freedom of expression with the freedom to lie.
It is said of me that I have bribed journalists what I have been an advisor to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your ideas.
It presents itself to the presidential struggle with financial thesis and criminal responsibilities of politicians and the declaration of ownership over twenty million.
To do so, the law must be changed.
As president he does not have this competence and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve it?
As a citizen, I have been part of a pressure group for the guidance profession to be recognized as self-employment, and we have achieved it.
The problem is in politics: if someone comes up with a good proposal, either on the right or on the left, it is rejected on purpose and this affects citizens.
As an independent candidate, I have greater potential for the support of all parliamentary groups.
Without party enclaves or dogmas, I have the ability to choose something from each party that is best for our country and apply it.
Is it considered rather a man on the right or on the left?
From the Czech point of view, I have the impression that people consider me more left-wing.
It doesn't matter to me, whether it's a little left or a little right.
What I care about is that we move on.
I don't care if someone's on the right or on the left, I want to join people.
I always openly support any good solution, regardless of whether the proposal comes from the KSČM or the ODS and, similarly, I will be against bad ideas.
You're joking when you're told you're populist.
But isn't he proving it by what he says?
When creating a business plan for the company, you also have certain goals and ideals.
And you're trying to get close to them.
There will be those who call it populism, but all the proposals I'm talking about already work in the world or well-known experts talk about them.
But without the support of the parliament, it is only recorded.
And with this he cannot survive in long-term politics.
Or do you believe that if you address people and talk to them, you will, for example, gain criminal and financial responsibility?
I have no choice.
Convincing politicians, journalists and civil society and trying to put them on my side to achieve that.
If he was elected president, there would be no problem in organizing a live broadcast on television in which he would ask the leaders of the parliamentary parties to legitimize criminal and financial responsibility for state politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And eventually they would have to communicate why they don't want it.
If there is a strong character that points to the disputes, you can put pressure on the political scene.
Let us take the direct election of the President, which has been a achievement of public pressure.
At the same time, I say I'm just an amateur, I'm neither a genius nor an intellectual.
For my opinions and ideals I try to seek allies.
I have just started in politics and I am trying to get as much support as possible for my programme.
I'm trying to pull things out myself, but in case it doesn't go well, I'll leave it in six years and I'll go back to the private sector.
Sounds a little like Okamura was going to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that with a person I don't do anything, so I've visited a number of well-known personalities, in case they might at best encourage themselves to submit their candidacy to the Senate.
I went to see Radim Jančura, but he refused because he had a lot of work to do.
For my part, at least I supported research journalist Jana Lorencová, who exposed fraud with light heating oils.
I introduced myself from the basis that people are really dissatisfied, now I'm on the balance.
Sixty percent of the population did not go to the polls and, those who did, voted to the representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate we are two of the independent sector.
People chose the Senate, so it will be difficult to make changes.
However, I will defend my own ideas, such as the direct choice of mayors or governors.
Are you considering forming your own game?
I haven't considered it yet because I don't have time for it, to check the spotless past of each of the potential party members, nor do I have money.
I don't even have money for the presidency campaign, in my transparent account there are only 20,000 crowns.
You don't have any money?
He's talking about property statements, what's yours?
I love my private property in about 60 million.
In Prague I have a field valued at 25 million, a flat valued at ten million, another floor taxed at eight million, a collection of works of art worth ten million, an Aston Martin of about 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb valued at one million, and in the account I have a couple of millions.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my dream of youth. I always liked James Bond, who was driving this car, was gallant with women and at the same time fought against evil and injustice.
Does an Aston Martin drive, his property is valued at 60 million and has no money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the republic but you don't want to put too much money on your side.
It's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to owe myself?
I've already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsor demonstrates that there is little interest in my programme.
And I have no obligation to pay the campaign with money from my pocket.
The campaign's expenses cover essentially what I will receive as Senator's salary.
But I couldn't live on it. For example, I couldn't pay my son the English school, which costs 30,000 kroner a month.
If I just wanted to make money, then I wouldn't run as a candidate.
So you'll continue your business so you can live?
Didn't you say before I was going to quit this activity?
This has nothing to do with a higher salary.
As I promised, I have partly left my activities.
For example, the representative of my travel agency will become my substitute in spring.
People wanted me to be the Samaritan who saved the republic.
But I also need to live on something.
How often do you earn monthly as an entrepreneur?
Between 200,000 and 400,000, I keep winning.
If I was president, then I'd leave business.

The MVRDV architecture study shows that true adventures are not only on the head - in the example of the Spijkenisse library and the newly completed "mountain of books"- 2 photos
"I think the building is fun, it has a futuristic look, and finally there's something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby passing through the street.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a large company located near the library, points out: "Besides, the building is beautiful."
But I wonder why we need a library today.
We all have Internet, tablets and e-books.
No one comes to the fore in those old-fashioned libraries, don't they?
Spijkenisse, a bedroom city located at the doors of Rotterdam that deserves just a fleeting visit, has the doubtful honour of having stood up with a record to forget.
The population of 80,000 has the lowest literacy rate in the Netherlands.
To counter this shameful situation, some years ago it was decided to contribute somehow to the general culture and copy the seven fictional bridges that appear represented in the euro banknotes in the form of decorated reinforced concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And so it was decided by the politicians that there was only one way to improve statistics: there had to be a library!
Winy Maas, from the Dutch architecture studio MVRDV, an entire master in the art of bar diagrams and responsible for fun buildings together as cynical, took the subject with its usual serenity and appeared at the presentation of the competition in 2003 with five books under the arm and a smile on the face.
And as the jury looked perplexed around him and shrugged his shoulders, Maas proceeded to stack the books by size forming a pyramid and concluded his brief speech with the following words: "Dear fellows:
Here you have it, my proposal for the mountain of books by Spijkenisse, the so-called 'Boekenberg'".
Nine years later, the 30 million euro mountain rises in the expected place.
This is part of the revitalization project, which is complemented by underground parking, a supermarket, a post office and a couple of housing buildings and townships.
In early November the mountain of books was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project is also nominated for the "Dutch National Wood Award 2012".
In this way, the little town lacking history, which so far had nothing more to offer than a pedestrian postmodern area and an incredibly ugly city after whose white facade one would rather intrude a milk plant, now has a contemporary architectural work.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The Long Road to the Book
The first impression is that it is a book paradise under a cheese maker.
It is true that there is an elevator that carries us right to the center of this massive mountain, but the true lovers of space and reading do not use it, but rather they prefer to merge with their topography every step of their climbing to the top.
The fully glazed interior is bright and easy to cover with the view, the recycled brick floor and the elegant lighthouses unequivocally support the public condition of the library.
The urban environment is perfect.
By raising the view you can see the park banks, the dogs and the boys and girls playing football.
And everywhere books, books and more books.
"The bookshelf shelves are usually arranged along the facade and in the centre there is a huge dark room that usually is somewhat uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
What we've done is put our legs up the classic spatial configuration and pull the reading area from the inside out.
The interior of the mountain is very well exploited: the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the environmental education centre and the maintenance room are located in the middle.
Special mention deserves the black shelves that assume the functions of wall covering, parapet and railing at the same time.
The sight, touch and smell are strange.
Even architects and civil engineers more daily shake their heads when they hear of this unknown material.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," explains Joop Trouborst, project leader in the city of Spijkenisse.
And that is how one day, on a Frisian farm, we encounter the appropriate by-product from agriculture.
For many years, in the greenhouses and in the fields of the Netherlands a plastic fabric of scarce millimetres of thickness has been used as a basis for holding the roots of crops.
It is cheap and efficient.
This thin fabric lasts two seasons and then is discarded.
For the library this fabric was first taken in such quantities until it obtained plates of four centimeters thick.
With heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) changes color and becomes a dark, homogeneous and resistant material that smells like a new car mix and sport slipper.
After 105 footpaths you reach the top of the mountain.
At the end of this continuous route of almost 500 meters around the mountain awaits us the reward: from the café you not only have a fantastic view of the city, but in it you can also enjoy tasty Dutch croquettes and their ficus planted in huge pots.
These create a pleasant atmosphere at the same time that maintains the right atmospheric humidity for this mountain of literature.
Donations to a new soul
"Although it is difficult to believe it given its large crystallized surfaces, this building is an exemplary project with regard to ecology," Trouborst says.
The required heating and cooling are obtained from geothermal energy.
Although the mountain of books is located under a huge pyramid of glass, even in the sunny days the sun only shines for a few hours inside it.
The huge wooden circles across the glass facade serve to provide shade and absorb most of the sun's rays.
This creates a comfortable interior climate.
The rest is automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the skeptical worker in the Information Technology sector, has already dared to set foot in the new library.
And Lisette Verhaig has been there too.
Similarly, traditional Chinese medicine teacher Cynthia Bogarde has visited the library. She calls the "Boekenberg" as Spijkenisse's "late soul".
The reason is that, at the inauguration that took place a couple of weeks ago, all the inhabitants of the city were invited to donate a book from their private collection.
In this way it is intended to fill, at the moment, the optical gaps of a library that does not yet have its complete file; currently it has 70,000 copies.
The concept has gone deep.
The shelves are full.
"There is nothing worse than an empty medium library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I believe that thanks to our initiative now all inhabitants have a certain link with this building.
Everyone knows your book is part of the library.
Even though I'm just there to decorate.
In this way, the MVRDV study has achieved a complete success in this discipline queen that in the specialized argot is known as "creation of an identity".
The city of Spijkenisse has written a piece of the history of literature.
Regardless of how young and uncultivated it may be.
Finally a starting point to shape your identity.
Szabo: "The Germans must play a more prominent role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, expert in U.S.-Europe relations, this puts Berlin in a rather dangerous diplomatic position.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany suggested that it would vote against the proposal to grant the Palestinian territories the status of observer State of the United Nations.
However, Berlin finally abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, due to the special relationship between the country and Israel, Germany must be careful.
But at the same time I do not think that I support the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being overly critical with Israel.
During the lifting in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to establishing a flight ban zone.
This has finally been declared by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to adopt a clear stance when important international issues are at stake?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because he is currently reorienting his foreign policy, moving away from a policy led, so to speak, by the United States and focusing on a German foreign policy.
And what makes things even harder is that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
Therefore, the Germans are at a crossroads.
Of them they are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they're still trying to figure out what their role is, but they've already started the way to a "normal" foreign policy.
A similar foreign policy to countries such as France or Great Britain.
What does a "normal" foreign policy specifically mean from the German point of view?
It is a policy that, when it comes to national interests, is willing to defend positions different from those of the United States or its European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy finds a strong motivation in economic policy, that is, in exports and their relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Near East.
German economic interests are to some extent different from those of other major powers, and for that reason Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the position taken with regard to the conflict in the Middle East and the UN vote?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Near East, especially in the Gulf.
That is why it must be careful and not be alienated from Arab public opinion or from Arab elites.
This is important, of course.
But I would not give such importance to you because it is not a fully unilateral relationship.
However, they do play a key role in German considerations.
Has Germany undermined its relationship with the United States by abstaining from voting in important decisions as in the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe, and even in the United States, the German position enjoys an enormous degree of understanding.
For this reason, I do not think there has been such a drastic rupture as in the case of Libya.
Perhaps Germany has managed to gain a certain amount of respect.
After all, all this has been done is to show that it is a country to which they take seriously as an international actor and whose interests must be taken into account.
There are different views in Europe about the Palestinian initiative.
On the other hand, the United States has clearly shown itself in favour of a veto.
Is there a disparity of views between the US and many European nations?
These disparities have always existed due to American domestic policy.
I think the Obama government secretly shows a great understanding of the European position.
But because of the political situation here, it is clear that the government cannot defend that position in public.
I believe that the true disparity of opinions does not really have the extent to which it is attributed.
If we look at the relations between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not at all excited about the policy he develops.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of its main partners in the EU, on the other?
I think that is exactly what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course it would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a coherent and homogeneous European policy, but that is not the case.
Therefore, they do not have the possibility to be part of a superior entity, but they must drive things from their own position.
That is exactly what they are doing now with the euro.
I believe that in future Germany will assume a leadership role in forcing Europe to adopt a European position.
Of course this is not easy for Germany, either simply because of the relationship it maintains with Israel.
This has always been a dangerous issue.
But I believe that the Germans are clear that they must play an independent role.
Does Germany see itself in the role of an important international actor? Does Germany really want to play a leading role?
Or is it still difficult for you to accept that leadership?
Germany has not yet become used to it, it is always a bit uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country continues to play a more important role.
If we look at the crisis of the euro, for example, we see that whenever Germany positions itself as the main actor, certain anti-German feelings are unleashed.
This is not easy for the Germans.
This is an old problem and nobody wants to be surrounded by enemy countries.
In view of this, Germany is in a far more difficult position than the United States.
It must show a responsive attitude towards the different neighbours and opinions and that is not easy.
The influence of the US on European policy is decreasing increasingly, but the EU is not currently covering that gap, who is left then?
The Germans will have no choice but to assume a more prominent role.
Even if they don't like it, if it's unpleasant to them or if it turns them into an even more unpopular people, it's life!

"Market Protection" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese brands
Armani is a world-renowned brand and Polo Ralph Lauren too.
But what is Armani Polo?
After this name, a name officially registered in China is hidden but has nothing to do with the original companies.
However, it enjoys protection as long as true eponies do not present a demand.
And even then it's not clear that they're going to be right.
"Foreigners find it increasingly difficult to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, firm attorney Taylor Wessing specializing in violations of protection rights in the Far East.
Every week a new case arrives at my table.
Imitators simply add a couple of letters to register their marks.
In this way, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and Prada is registered instead of Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied in the same way, as has happened to the manufacturer of sports items Puma.
Pattloch opens an archive where he stores seats from Beijing's brand office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company requested to register the brand Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name that was also used by the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
That the Chinese are world champions when it comes to copying and violating intellectual property rights is well known.
In large cities there are large warehouses of several plants dedicated exclusively to the sale of counterfeits.
However, Pattloch's cases are of a different nature. On the responsibility of its customers, he fights against the fact that the trademark office officially grants Chinese companies the right to take advantage of a denomination that is already registered elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Ming Pai" or accompanying brand.
The word has its origin in the Chinese term "Bang Dakuan",
which refers to women who have "fished" a rich man.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty
"It's harmful to the business, you have to fight it," Pattloch says.
"The brand makes water, the monopolistic position disappears and the damage the image suffers is enormous."
The financial losses and procedural costs of the affected sectors are million, especially in the case of luxury emblematic products.
According to data from the CLSA market analysis company, with a volume of €15 billion per year China is, in size, the third luxury item market and the growing at the highest rate.
However, achieving the cancellation of registrations of dubious legality in the registration of trademarks is complicated and also involves a lot of money.
Processes can be extended to nine years and the result is uncertain.
Pattloch talks about cases in which the court dismissed a claim because it had taken so long that the name under the claim had already become a "market reality".
"If the complainant is unlucky, he may even have to pay the plagiarismor money because the process has damaged his brand in China," Pattloch says.
Sometimes this is the law of the jungle.
Some of the most known cases have to do with graphic elements.
In 2009 Daimler-Benz lost a fight against the manufacturer of Sany construction machinery, the company that has recently been absorbed by the German manufacturer of concrete pumps Putzmeister.
That's why today Chinese can still use a very similar emblem to Mercedes' star.
Volvo's buyer, Geely, initially used a blue and white logo that reminded BMW to a large extent; the matter was settled in court and Geely had to modify it.
The Lacoste clothing manufacturer lost in China against imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore whose logo represented a crocodile looking in the opposite direction to the original.
The Chinese authorities don't feel guilty.
The CTMO brand office in Beijing recognizes that in 2010 they have experienced difficulties due to the shortage of equipment and staffing.
Last year, however, "the work emergency situation returned to normal."
Thus, the number of unprocessed claims has been reduced by 22 per cent.
Nearly 57,000 of these cases were resolved, 75% more than the previous year.
However, 81,500 claims remain outstanding.
Fighting this costs a lot of money
As usual in China, the figures are surprising.
Last year the CTMO recorded more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost one third more than in 2010.
It would be a new record and it means that China is leading the list of new registrations around the world for the tenth consecutive year, according to the brand office.
It seems that this also happens with the number of valid logos, which totals 5.5 million.
In 2011, 1,800 million yuan would have been paid in respect of rights.
In other words, this means that on average each registration costs 1,280 yuan or 160 euros.
Fighting this costs a lot of money, as the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the group has been fighting a Chinese copycat in court.
While the Germans have succeeded in halting the illegal manufacture of imitation car parts,
the impersonator has managed to secure Chinese rights over the brand Freudenberg.
"We ourselves have provoked this situation because in Germany the surnames are not protected," says Hanno Wentzler, President and CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO Trademark Office also dismissed the appeal of the muniqueses.
In the following two instances Freudenberg has been justified, but the opposite party continues to fight at present.
You have to be very careful.
The case has now reached the doors of the High Court of Justice, where the resolution remains pending.
Wentzler trusts that the issue can be resolved favourably and commends the professionalism of the courts.
However, it also states that "the procedure is extremely expensive, both in terms of money and time."
It is difficult to estimate internal costs; the business archive has had to review files up to a hundred years old in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg offered the opposite side a "summary of six digits in euros" in order to reach a friendly agreement, but it was unsuccessful.
"This demonstrates how much we care," says Wentzler.
The dangers facing the Far East even threaten to affect Europe,
specifically if copymakers secure rights to unprotected trademarks there.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer tried to register in Germany the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products.
The group has long abandoned this commercial area, yet it has been able to prevent registration.
"You have to be very careful," Wentzler says.
Both he and lawyer Pattloch recommend to German companies that they be extremely prudent when doing business with China.
It is not enough to trust international legislation on trademark rights, but what must be done is to "register also in China all that may be susceptible to protection", as Wentzler points out.
Otherwise, the subject can be much more expensive than a mere record.
In fact, if Freudenberg had lost the last assault on his particular battle, then he would have to pay the opposite party license rights on his own name, as Wentzler explains.
That or in the segment in question would expel us from the market.
World AIDS Day: dancing, singing, helping
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi choir is tested and in Swaziland, AIDS orphans are happy
The history of a bond capable of exceeding much more than 8,733 kilometres away.
First starts with the dance: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, heel shoes and mocasins look for the compass on the parquet floor, and they find it quickly.
One, two, three, four.
Only then begin to slowly raise the voices of the singers (contract, bass, tenor and soprano), shaking, numbing and following each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old director, threatens to get out of his boxes by trying to put order with his energetic and gentle gestures.
It is Monday afternoon and in the music room of Heidelberg's Institute of Medical Psychology the Imbongi choir will practice a new song.
The 50 singers, between 23 and 69 years old, have also arrived from the human geneticist to the host.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each voice of the choir has a different text and in addition in a foreign language hardly known: Zulu, a language spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some areas of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
According to a UNAIDS estimate, the United Nations programme to combat AIDS, around 34 million people are infected with HIV worldwide.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
In Swaziland there are 245,000 AIDS orphans.
More than 40% of the population is already HIV positive.
The Voices for Africa Association has found in Germany patrons for the 180 AIDS orphans of the people of Estijeni.
Seventy of them attend high school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can sponsor a child.
This contribution will cover the school registration, the uniform and guarantee you a hot meal a day at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means "story storyteller" or "panegirist" in Zulu.
In this room no one knows how to speak fluently this Bantu language, but singing does know.
For ten years this choir has been teaching songs in this mild foreign language that sometimes manages to transport them to their place of origin: South Africa.
8.733 kilometres away from Heidelberg, northeastern of the kingdom of Swaziland, there is a village called Estijeni that depends on the voices of this German choir.
Forty percent is infected
Approximately 2,000 people live there, some still in simple mud and straw huts, a large part of them are children.
More than 300 people no longer have parents because they have succumbed to AIDS.
Esitjeni is a small example of what affects Swaziland: the highest rate of AIDS infection and the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to Unicef.
The population does not see circumcision with good eyes, a practice that has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half.
More than 40% of people in Swaziland are carriers of the immunodeficiency virus, and dying more than thirty years of age has become a common practice.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered this crowded population, but what they saw above all were many children in the streets who lacked not only the protection of their parents, but the main thing: food, clothing and training.
Without a school degree, the possibilities in a poor country are more than scarce.
At first it was only the particular commitment of a few that made it possible for a child to go to school and enjoy a hot meal a day. All this for a few euros.
However, a year later the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa" which has since been professionally involved with AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Among the STDs of bacterial origin are syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
The most common viral STDs are AIDS, human papilloma virus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
The bricks and sarna are among the STDs transmitted by parasites.
What are the main groups of affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are more often seen in men who have sexual relations with other men.
The Robert Koch Institute is based on the fact that at least four out of every five cases of syphilis registered in Germany have their origin in sexual contact with men.
In the case of heterosexual adults, the most common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydia, trichono, human papilloma virus, candidiasis (hongo) and gonorrhea infections.
HIV infection among the country's heterosexual adults is relatively low; however, approximately 20 per cent of the new HIV infections are registered in this group.
Among young people, chlamydia infections are much more common than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people between 15 and 25 years of age.
In our country, the human papilloma virus is also added to the most common diseases among young people.
How has the number of infections evolved?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to compulsory declaration.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has continued to decline since 2007.
In 2011, approximately 2,700 cases were recorded.
This is a tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate that this is a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, discomfort when urinating, flow, abdominal pain, as well as ampoules or warts.
They often do not cause pain or cause other symptoms, which is why they are not detected.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms may reduce the risk of infection, but do not offer 100 per cent protection.
Some pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases may also be transmitted through infections due to dirt and physical contact.
For this reason, experts recommend regular medical examinations, especially if they change frequently as a sexual partner.
If diagnosed early, most STDs can be cured and any late consequences can be avoided.
Through collaborations, donations and, last but not least, the fees charged by the choir for their actions throughout Germany, they come to raise a lot of money.
"In total we have already sent some 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," says proud Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the town itself Zodwa Dlamini a woman with self-confidence and leadership skills manages the money sent from Germany.
It takes care that orphans find a good accommodation, for example with one of their grandmothers.
The "gogogos", as the older women in Zulu are called, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans in charge, offer them a roof where they live and take care of the children going to school every day and dressed in their uniforms.
Those who have no one remain under the protection of Khanyisile, a single woman who, like the two cooks who cook every day for more than 200 hungry children, receives a salary from the association.
In addition, "Voices of Africa" has started a sewing school, has built two hens and, in collaboration with the US health organization PSI, has achieved that many of the people of the people have been tested for HIV.
This is not obvious, since, despite the patent that this disease is throughout the country, it is not often spoken of openly.
A king with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Something strange in a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his opulent and excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This unofficially accepted form of life is largely responsible for the rapid spread of HIV in recent decades.
But it is also because of the countless temporary workers who travel the country from one place to another and take it wherever they go.
According to Annette Lennartz, "in any corner you can get free condoms, but these are barely used.
It's another culture, here they only accept skin contact with skin."
To promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels every two or three years across South Africa singing songs that speak of melancholy, combative spirit, hope and trust in the black race, songs that many in the southernmost extreme of the African continent still recall the time of apartheid.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language; so much recognition not only brings an excellent atmosphere and great joy, but has also managed to tear out a couple of tears to someone other angry border soldier.
The trip always takes them to Esitjeni, where the singers visit the foster children.
Although this small town hardly appears on the maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni River is well known.
"Come to Esitjeni, there the light shines," the local people say.
And after traveling the 8,733 kilometers straight back to Heidelberg to the rehearsal rooms of Bergheimer Street filled with singers marking the pass, one realizes that it is also possible to see their light shine from there.
Messenger: NASA Discovers Ice in Mercury · Global Voices
The Messenger probe has found evidence of the existence of ice in Mercury.
Probably the ice layer has a thickness of up to 20 meters.
NASA, the American space agency, has provided evidence of the existence of ice in Mercury.
Although it is the planet closest to the sun, there is also iced water, as it appears from three studies published on Thursday in the specialized magazine "Science".
The Messenger probe would have found evidence that an ice layer has been formed in the area of the planet that is permanently in the shadow.
It looks like it's at least 30 cm and probably up to 20 meters thick.
The water comes presumably from comets or, very likely, asteroids that in their day collided with Mercury.
No one links the ice finding with the possibility of life on the planet, says Chief Researcher of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature in Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees centigrade.
However, findings could help to clarify how water and other life components have arrived in other areas of the solar system.
Completely unwarranted for the inhabitants of planet Earth, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix are dedicated to exploring the depths of the universe.
Occasionally they send images to Earth: small windows to the immensity of space.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets that make up our solar system, besides the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which revolves around the sun just behind Neptune, according to the new definition of the term published by the International Astronomical Union in 2006 Ceres is no "planet".
This section of an infrared image taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" in which countless generations of stars appear: the oldest stars are shown as blue points, although the most difficult to recognize is the pink color of the "newborn" stars.
This region of star formation, hardly romantically called by scientists W5, was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation of Cassiopea, at a distance of 6,500 light years.
This tornado image of an extinct star was taken by NASA's Spitzer telescope.
The donut-shaped ring is composed of the material that the star spits in its extinction process.
In the huge Trifida Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, new stars are formed from gas and dust.
NASA's Spitzer telescope took this photo from the galactic star formation area.
The Pleyades, a group of stars also known as "The Seven Sisters", are a visible object simply seen in the night sky.
However, with the telescope you can better appreciate the colors.
The Helix Nebula appears as a huge red eye appears in this infrared image.
It is located 700 light years from the Aquarium constellation.
His similarity to an earthly continent has earned him the last name of North America.
The combination of a normal photograph and an image of infrared leads to a spectacular color.
This sky star could be captured throughout its splendor for the first time by the Spitzer telescope infrared detectors.
Saturn and its rings: how they originated remains one of the great incognites of astronomy.
It's probably a remains of one of Saturn's moons that disappeared without a trace of 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and sharpest photographs taken by the Hubble telescope: the Whirlpool Galaxy.
Depending on the tonalities, some images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The image published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifida Nebula located several thousand light years in the constellation of Sagittarius.
The name Trifida comes from the Latin term "trifidus" (divided into three), since dark dust lines divide the burning heart of this star formation area into three lobes.
In the constellation of Ofiuco, astronomers were able to photograph the signs of a cosmic carambola: at 400 million light years of Earth the nuclei of two galaxies in the fusion process are swayed to each other in order to end up collapsing irreparably.
This formation of stars was captured by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those who do not like technical abbreviations may refer to it with the nickname of Southern Molinillo.
The photograph of the Hubble space telescope shows a section of the Nebula Iris in the constellation of Cepheus.
The 1,400 light-year-old nebula is composed of dust particles that are between ten and a hundred times smaller than that of dust particles that we can find in a house.
This image was created from optical images and X-rays made by different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes located 430 million light years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, served for a moment as a model for NASA's Hubble Space Telescope.
Scientists call the largest spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
In this nebula lies the brightest young star group in our Milky Way.
This star formation zone constantly produces new stars.
In this cloud of stars, associated with the Roseta Nebula, there are also constantly new stars; 5,000 light years from Earth.
In this galaxy so bright with a small black hole there is still no dust, only gas.
Researchers assume that it was formed shortly after the big bang, when in the universe it could be found mostly hydrogen.
Our window to the universe: the most important telescopes
It seems that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galilei used it a year later to watch the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have not ceased to grow and the images they offer have become more and more profound.
For 30 years, particularly from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope located in the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest in the world.
His mirror, in the image, had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, U.S.A., the Large Binocular Telescope rises.
This allows to observe the cosmos through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias located on the island of La Palma is huge - only the mirror has a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Despite this, it reaches a diameter of approximately eleven meters.
The drawback of this more economical construction is that the telescope has a fixed elevation angle, so its mobility is limited.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Tejas also has a fixed elevation angle.
Its particularity is its huge ability to collect light.
Despite having a comparatively smaller mirror diameter, this capacity is comparable to that of the largest mirror telescopes in the world.
With the help of Arecibo Radiotelescope (Puerto Rico) researchers can explore the universe in search of extraterrestrial life signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI for its acronyms in English) you can help anyone who owns a computer, providing processing capacity.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) located in the Chilean Andes.
Here stands the Very Large Telescope, a telescope that honors its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can also illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
The ESO will also host the so-called E-ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope or European Extremely Large Telescope).
Its primary mirror will cover 42 meters and will consist of a total of 1,000 reflective elements.
Until 2018 you don't expect to be able to take pictures.
Until 2007 the two Keck telescopes located in Mauna Kea Hawaiian volcano were considered the largest in the world.
These have two mirrors, each with a diameter of 10 meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of Mauna Kea Observatory, which, along with them, explores the sky with the help of the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
In Mauna Kea it is planned to build a new telescope of huge proportions and with a mirror diameter of 30 meters.
This is an image of what it would be like.
However, the most important information of the cosmos comes from the hand of the Hubble space telescope.
Since April 24, 1990 sends images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope has been looking for extrasolar planets, especially those that are habitable.
On 2 February 2011, NASA announced that since the start of its mission 1,235 planet candidates had been located.
The image shows the latest preparations for the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) telescope will not be launched into space on board an Ariane 5 rocket until 2018.
The primary mirror of this space telescope is 6.5 meters in diameter.
One of the functions of this telescope will be to search for the light from the first stars and galaxies formed after the big bang.
Researchers are based on the fact that there is also ice in the southern pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable evidence, as the Messenger probe revolves around the planet in a much closer orbit to the north pole.
For decades radar measurements have pointed to the existence of ice in Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger (2004) probe, the first one orbiting Mercury, now scientists are sure it is.
Drinking butter daily and living 168 years

There is even a museum dedicated to longevity.
A search for fingerprints in a country where 97-year-olds are still considered young.
The journey through the mountainous region of Talysh could be described as wild and romantic.
The minibus is proceeding with great haste through the winding road passing by woody hills, large-flowing rivers and the simple houses of local farmers.
Everything is green and juicy, one might even think it's in the Black Forest.
However, we are in the southernmost area of Azerbaijan; from here the border with Iran is just a few kilometers away.
Here live the "talyshi", a town of which you don't know much, apart from which they perfectly dominate the Persian and Azerbaijani and which are very far away.
Our final destination is Lerik.
This small city boasts of perhaps too massive architecture designed in the Soviet era and does not seem to fit entirely into such a picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists hardly reach this place, as the road from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is too heavy.
To travel the 323 kilometres that separate both urban nuclei, it takes eight hours because the road is of one direction only.
The amazing wealth enjoyed by the country thanks to Caspian sea oil has not yet reached this region.
However, Pilate Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what it takes to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May for the celebration of the Eurovision Festival and next year we will celebrate the festival of the oldest people in the world," Fatulayeva said.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, perhaps the only one that exists in the world.
Here is documented the life of eight dozen talyshis of the place that has passed the 100 years old. Fatulayeva points out a black and white image.
This is my grandfather, who lived for 120 years.
One of his sons died at the age of 136
However, the museum's undisputed star is the shepherd of Şirali Müslümov, who seems to have lived 168 years.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And if we take into account that the older man documented lived 122 years, it seems that the age of Müslümov is quite suspicious.
"Nation in the region in 1805 and died in 1973," Fatulayeva explains.
The man was married three times and had 23 children. Apparently he still had time to conceive a daughter over the age of 136.
Has Şirali Müslümov then been wrong in his age in a couple of decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard about the age of this Central Asian resident.
"In some regions of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan also live very old people," says Scholz, "even in Sardinia there are many older men."
Due to the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific evidence about age; maximum when there is no civil record.
Every day cups filled with melted butter
It is a fact that, surprisingly common, people in the region around Lerik usually reach a Bible age.
There are currently 20 people over 100 years of age.
Why do they live here, in the south, so many elderly people?
The Azerbaijani tourist guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that it is the special genes of the talyshis.
The director of the museum, Mrs Fatulayeva, believes instead that the cause lies in food.
However, from a nutritional point of view, it does not seem logical that precisely the calorie-rich food of the talyshi, who worship meat, bread and above all dairy products and many of whom also drink daily a glass of melted butter, be so healthy.
Or is it perhaps the natural way of life that keeps young people? In Cengemiran, a small settlement not far from the city of Lerik lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At the age of 97 he is relatively young for what is stilted by these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
Sitting on the ground, it moves a huge bowl of butter tirelessly.
Eight people live under a roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and a daughter, both became grandparents a long time ago.
They also play from side to side two little children.
In the kitchen they prepare tea for the guests, a tea that serves in typical glasses with abombada shape.
Mirzayeva's teeth are white and perfectly aligned and under the handle hides two long braids of dark red hair that your son finds us proud.
I've always washed my hair with milk, which is why I've never fallen and kept my color.
"I have never used a shampoo either," Mirzayeva says.
The pension is enough to live
He has always eaten only what he produced on his own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
In my whole life I've never been to shop at a supermarket.
Then she tells us about her husband, who was in the army.
The worst was the post-World War II era.
However, everything came back to its way when the "Dear Father," Heydar Aliyew, took control of the situation.
This kind of propaganda sounds weird in the mouth of an older woman.
However, in Azerbaijan the worship that is professed to the paternal figure of the nation, which directs its country as a dictator, knows no limits.
This remained in power until 2003, when the witness handed over to his son Ilham.
At least the older people of Azerbaijan do not know what poverty is.
Mirzayeva collects 230 manat (approximately the same amount in euros) in terms of monthly pension, an amount with which you can live well considering the situation here.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's canous son is right: "In our culture the older are highly respected."
They live in a large family, are loved, receive all the necessary care and are happy.
As if this wasn't enough reason to stay alive for many years...
The term “Human rights” is lacking in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Protests that rival each other in Cairo highlight the tremendous division in which the country is sinking.
The future constitution, with sharia as its basis, is highly controversial.
The Egyptian president did not resort to patheticism.
"We must overcome the transition.
And that happens is my responsibility before the people and before God," he said on public television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, especially the Christian Coptics, liberals, illustrious Muslims and seculars.
All of them, immersed without remedy so far in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a theocracy on the banks of the Nile for the grace of the powerful Muslim community.
As Mohammed Morsi explains, almost asking for forgiveness, he has had to temporarily cancel the competences of the Constitutional Court and expand his "in order to save the revolution".
However, neither the Egyptians nor the whole world know very well what this 61-year-old engineer with a Ph.D. degree awarded by the University of Southern California really wants to save.
Do you intend to deprive the judiciary of its power?
In fact, the 234 articles, which have been enforced by a constituent assembly consisting of 100 predominantly Islamist members at a 15-hour night meeting, are truly worrying.
As in previous constitutions, the draft also states that jurisprudence is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
However, what does "principles" mean?
This was and continues to be open to interpretation and it seems that Islamists are going to take advantage of this vague formulation, as well as the margin of legal manoeuvre that takes place, to impose a stricter interpretation of the sharia.
This is at least what a new article added suggests: in all matters relating to sharia it is mandatory to consult Al-Ashar University, the country's most important Islamic institution with great power throughout Sunni Islam.
It does not have to be so, but this may mean that the clergy would control the legislation, something which - in fact - would result in the incapacity of the judiciary.
Much of the draft constitution is open to interpretation
What is also problematic is that it intends to maintain military jurisdiction.
During Mubarak's dictatorship, these courts served to bring about harsh repression of the opposition.
After the dictator's fall up to 11,000 civilians were detained in military prisons.
As the draft states, the State must protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "promote its morals and values".
It is such an inaccurate formulation in legal terms that with the help of this article state institutions could even control the content of cinematography and literature.
Clearly this is nothing but censorship.
By the way, no article explicitly establishes equality between men and women.
On the other hand, another forbids offending or slandering the Prophet Mohammed and his legacy.
However, it is not clear what an offense is and how it should be punished.
Equally dubious is the formulation that prohibits "injurious persons"
Is it enough a caricature of the president or a joke about a lawyer?
Question of interpretation, like many other things in the draft that has been presented to Morsi for his signature and that according to his words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians to be subjected to referendum.
"The revolution is back"
For weeks the opposition has been closing ranks against the superiority of Islamists.
Ten thousand people met in unusual harmony on Friday afternoon at Tahrir Square in Cairo and swore to fail the Minutes before it could come into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will end up winning," says Hamdin Sabbahi, who occupies third place on the lists to the presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace and former director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, stated that the draft constitution should be "in the bucket of the waste of history".
Through Twitter he accused the followers of Morsi of wanting to lead a "state coup against democracy".
"When he summons the referendum we will go to his palace and overthrow it," said opposition Jasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been at issue," the opposition politician Chaled Ali was quoted in the Egyptian media.
And several judges announced that they did not wish to oversee the referendum, so it would not be considered valid.
"The Qur'an is our constitution"
The well-organized Muslim community, for its part, called for a counter-protestation; in case not in Tahrir Square, but after a prayer across the Nile to the University of Cairo.
Many women covered with a veil and supporters of the Salafists took part in the same cry: "the people demand the application of the divine law."
They demanded Morsi to "clean the country", while proclaiming: "The Qur'an is our constitution."
A struggle for the sovereignty of the symbolic Tahrir Square, where everything began, would have led to a situation similar to that of a civil war.
It is clear that Morsi's supporters did not want to risk such a thing.
The Muslim brothers claimed that both those who oppose the draft constitution and supporters of the constitution would have expressed their views loud and clear.
Now would be the time to let the people decide which direction the country should take.
In this regard, it seems that the draft of Islamists has guaranteed the majority.
"The expression 'Human Rights' doesn't even appear"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry at this forced constitutional process that should actually have lasted until February and included all the social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended Muslim brothers when they were held in prison or had to face a trial during the Mubarak dictatorship.
Not because he shared his ideology, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
For this reason he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And now the expression `Human Rights' doesn't even appear in the new constitution," laments in a conversation with the newspaper "Welt am Sonntag".
The extension of Morsi's powers to the three powers of the State caused this lawyer to resign.
The measures taken are flagrant violations of the rules of democratic play and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, what the president has done is abolishing it," Saeda regrets.
However, democracy cannot work without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels abandoned, also by the international community, which observes the ideological struggle that is taking place on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could turn against you.
A protester at Tahrir Square warns: "you are designing a monster that you cannot control."
The Norwegian rakfisk: the world's most evil fish?
The five million people in Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe but in the world.
Is it possible that the country's success has any connection with its greed for an extremely evil fish?
Take a series of overheated cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a mountain of dirty and wet football clothes.
Leave it there for a week.
It will then smell the palsy aroma of rakfisk, one of Norway's exquisites.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
It's snowy. The landscape is spectacular and that smell, always present, floats in the air.
The rakfisk is salad trout that is left fermented in water during, depending on how bad you prefer it, up to a year.
As it darkens and it gets colder, Norwegians flock to a festival that is celebrated here in Fagernes, dedicated to this food most, so to speak, captivating.
"It eats raw and then drinks an aquavit glass of a drink," says Harvard Halvarsen, a city fireman who is also what is known as the "General of the Rakfisk", who is responsible for organizing the festival.
We see people everywhere eating this fish that is kept in small cubes and drinking from a large amount of drink.
"Some people like aquavit more than rakfisk," Harvard says.
Drink can kill the smell.
I'll try some pieces.
If you can avoid passing it near the nose, it's not bad; it's not very different from a portion of sushi that has traveled a few kilometers by bus.
Rakfisk is a product that comes from a very different time, in which poverty hit Norway and, before refrigeration, fish was stored during the fall immersed in water and salt in hermetic barrels.
Later, in the middle of winter, when it is already well fermented, it is released and, obviously with the inactive senses due to alcohol, it is eaten.
Just one generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, and they emigrated mainly to the United States.
At present, the population is growing rapidly; more than 13 per cent are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, high wages and a complete system of social services.
A stream of inhabitants of Sweden, the old rival and even makes it not far richer than Norway, comes to this country to work.
The rakfisk is considered to be something important, an essential part, albeit quite malolent, of Norway's past.
It is among the most expensive dishes you can buy.
But, in fact, everything is expensive. A beer cane or a sandwich cost you the friolera of 10€ ($14) each.
Norway does not usually appear on the international news agenda and most Norwegians like it.
Here people are still unwilling to pronounce the name Anders Breivik, the extreme right-wing racist who shot and murdered 77 people, including men, women and children.
Instead, they refer to shooting as "the event of 22 July".
The Norwegians find it very difficult to believe that one of their own peaceful country could commit such cruelty and murder.
Following much of Norway's present wealth is the growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries since the early 1970s.
"But oil is not the only reason we're doing so well," says Anna, our waitress, as she passes Rakfisk trays and, with her long red melon and her amazing blue eyes, represents the image of Norwegian well-being.
"We are, as you say, prudent people."
His English, like most people in this country, is impeccable.
"We don't like to brag, we don't like to show off."
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution; everything, except a small percentage of the money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for future generations.
While everyone wasted money that they did not have during the years leading up to the financial crisis around the world, Norway kept the wallet tight.
"As long as we can ski in winter and hike in summer, we're happy," says Anna.
"And eat rakfisk," he adds with a developed carcass.
I'm in the snow doing queue to eat something; I've already had enough rakfisk.
Now an alce hamburger is certainly something different and quite succulent to taste.
But at night, it's coming back that nasty fish.
The hotel in which I stay is one of the many venues where a rakfisk dinner is held where the diners vote the best fish, or perhaps the one that most tests the nasal pits.
A television has been connected live with a presenter who wears a bird and is surrounded by rakfisk dishes.
It looks like the Eurovisión competition.
"What are your scores for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here's our score, Harvard."
There are laughter and applause.
A man falls from the chair, perhaps defeated by the aquavit.
Or maybe it's the vapors of all that fish.
Mexico: Enrique Peña Nieto Faces a Hard Start · Global Voices
While the incoming President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, is preparing to take over his position, BBC correspondent Will Grant analyses the challenges facing the new president and the different expectations of his population.
Traffic in Mexico City is especially bad at present.
In a city that, under the best circumstances, is already congested, a steel fence has been installed since Monday that cuts down several of the main roads that lead to the city and is causing enormous chaos on the roads.
The aim, however, was not to prevent workers from reaching their jobs, but rather to prevent demonstrators from reaching parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new president, Enrique Peña Nieto, will receive the presidential band and take over the nation's management.
He's facing a complicated task.
Mexico has been achieving good economic results during the outgoing government of Felipe Calderon, but the country is immersed in a war against drug trafficking which has already claimed some 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has a great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," Peña Nieto explained earlier this week to the President of the United States, Barack Obama, at the Oval Office.
"I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve that goal."
Before coding with the president of the United States, Mr. Peña's previous political experience was as governor of his native state, Mexico.
A very populated and rapidly growing state, which surrounds the capital; Opinions about the new leader are divided into this territory in which he used to move.
A sincere man
In the bucolic city of Valle del Bravo, for example, he is remembered with affection.
Its residents attribute the merit of the growth of tourism in place and the construction of infrastructure.
To get to the city you can drive through one of Mr. Peña Nieto's new roads, which is a huge improvement compared to the steep and full of skimmed roads that were rehabilitated.
You can also see plates with their name at the entrance of a modern sports club and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We trust that he can make a real and lasting change," says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernández, deputy of the Peña Nieto party, the PRI.
"In particular, as far as security and economics are concerned, we expect the interesting and real change our country needs so much."
After an uninterrupted period of 81 years in power, the PRI was released by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Member Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are many expectations within the party regarding Enrique Peña Nieto.
It also rejects the rating that the opposition lacks the essence of the new president.
"He is a very sincere man, very committed and with an excellent view of the country.
He's a fantastic stateman and, above all, he's a person who can hear."
However, on the other side of the state that is not the impression that many people have on their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as the City of Neza, the contrast with the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
Hidden under high highway tracks is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems of the municipality are also harsh and urban.
Earlier this year, military intervention was requested to assist in the fight against drug gangs operating in the neighbourhoods and violence against women was particularly serious.
In a desert plot, located next to a garbage dump, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been abandoned in only the last two years.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Peña Nieto was the governor, a much higher rate than that of Ciudad Juárez, unfortunately famous for his violence and a place that is synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
The critics of Mr. Peña Nieto say, at best, that he was unable to address the problem of feminicide while in charge.
The most critical accuses his administration of having a fat look.
In a concrete house, typical of the damaged neighborhood, Irinea Buendía has to make efforts to contain tears while showing me pictures of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the facts, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
Her family, however, believes that her partner murdered her.
"When I got to her house, it seemed as if she had cleaned up her body," recalls Mrs. Buendía.
"There were signs that she had been beaten and rigor mortis had already appeared."
As her mother tells the story, a photograph of Mariana looks from the walls, next to a cross where one word is read: Justice.
However, that is exactly what the family says it has been denied.
"The state authorities have treated me as if I were an old gossiper, a drunkard, a complaint.
What they want is for one to just accept what they say and to shut up."
"But that cannot be so when there have been so many irregularities and so much neglect," he says.
The presidential band that President Peña Nieto will receive on Saturday will be accompanied by a huge responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crimes in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised to give them priority during his term of office.
"I hope he's the same kind of president he was when he was governor," says PRI Olvera's deputy in Valle del Bravo.
However, that is precisely what the families of the victims of Neza City fear most.
Bradley Manning did not report ill-treatment, according to prosecutors
Prosecutors are trying to deal with reports of Bradley Manning's abuse during his time in prison.
The trial focuses on Manning's period at Quantico military prison in Virginia
The defense wants the case to be dismissed on the basis that Manning's incarceration was severe
The army soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
The prosecutors tried to prove on Friday that Private Bradley Manning, accused of the greatest leak of confidential information in the history of the United States, lost multiple opportunities to report the ill-treatment he now claims he suffered while under military detention.
During the interrogation carried out by the prosecution in a pretrial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Prosecutor Ashden Fein stated that the records of the weekly visits of officers of the unit that Manning received during nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, show no complaints about the treatment he was receiving.
The interrogation, which took place during a hearing carried out following the defence ' s request to dismiss the case as its imprisonment had been harsh and that it had already been sufficiently punished, came one day after Manning had testified that he had planned to commit suicide while he was in detention.
The army intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while serving in Iraq.
Later, WikiLeaks published the material on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of information.
In view of Friday, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms that officers completed after visits to Manning during his arrest at Quantico military prison, where he was held in maximum detention from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers would have asked Manning questions and noted his answers.
When on Friday Fein asked about the forms, Manning recognized that he had qualified the treatment given to him by the celators as "excellent" and the treatment received at the facilities in general as "very professional".
The forms show no complaints of ill-treatment, although the officers asked Manning directly about the treatment he was receiving, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed concern about some issues and that the officers visiting him had spoken about these issues and had indicated to him that they would be dealt with, but that they did not record those issues in the register.
"They wrote 'no incident' (after having talked about the problems) but this does not necessarily mean that I had not mentioned any problems," Manning said.
The judge, Army Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he had not denounced the treatment he received during the meeting that took place in January 2011 with a council to examine the suicide intentions he had expressed in a form months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during that meeting was to obtain the reduction of the “injury prevention” regime under which he was present.
The military said that they had placed him under that restrictive regime, which was below the level of possible suicide surveillance, in order to guarantee his protection and security for others.
"I wanted the state to know that I was okay and (I wanted) to stop being under injury prevention... in order to enjoy what, from my point of view, is a better quality of life," Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to military prison at the Marine Base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he had considered suicide in Kuwait and once lost consciousness due to heat.
He said that the fact that he was not allowed to know what was happening to him or what was happening in the outside world was very distressing.
"My world was only reduced to Arafjon Camp, to that cage," Manning explained on Thursday.
"I thought I was going to die in that cage."
Manning said that, once transferred to Quantico, he spent most of the days in a small cell, at least for 21 hours and often for 23 hours, without company.
Manning said he was only allowed to have a mattress, a blanket, some chalks, some clothes and glasses.
He explained that he was trying to move all the time, since it was forbidden to sleep or even fall asleep during the day.
Manning said he always had a light from outside pointing to his eyes while he was asleep.
He said that if the janitors couldn't see his face when he turned around at night, they would wake him up to turn himself around again.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal claim in January 2011 on the treatment Manning received.
Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth military prison in Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday the judge asked Manning about an argument he had made in the Thursday statement, according to which, after being forced one night to sleep naked in his Quantico cell, he was forced during a morning count to stand naked in front of the janitors and other prisoners.
Manning had testified that he had never been given the opportunity to cover himself with the blanket during the count.
During the judge's interrogation on Friday, Manning said he deduced from the order that he had given him the coven that he should drop the blanket he could have covered with, but recognized that no one had ordered him to drop it.
Manning testified on Thursday that they had forced him to sleep naked the night before because of an attempt to prove to an officer that he did not pose a danger to himself.
Manning stated that he had told the officer that he could have used the elastic of his underwear or his chalks to self-injury but that he had not.
Manning testified that that night they had removed from their cell their underwear, their chalks and glasses.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account the experiences he had experienced during his stay in prison and drastically reduce his sentence if he was convicted on the war council, which is expected to start early next year.
The defence stated that it plans to have Manning find himself guilty of minor crimes and to defend other accusations considered too extreme.
The hearing is expected to resume this weekend and prosecutors are expected to argue that the conditions of detention are justified.
The Pentagon has argued that Manning was held in accordance with the rules of application to any detained person who is in maximum custody in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include cooperation with the enemy, unlawfully causing the publication of information on the Internet, leaking information from the national defence and theft of property or public records.
If he is found guilty of all charges, he could face life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American identity crisis
He claims that many were forced to leave Mexico due to lack of opportunity
Mexicans tend to criticize those who went away; they say they remind Mexicans of those difficult times
Navarrette comments that Mexican-Americans are trapped between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, he had just gone down the street and arrived at the immigration processing area and was already totally confused.
Some posters indicated the way to two tails: one for Mexicans and one for Foreigners.
I stayed there for a few seconds without being sure where I should go.
As I grew up in Central California, all my life they called me "Mexican."
This is ethnic tachography, just as my friends in Boston refer to themselves as "Irish" or my friends in New York qualify themselves as "Italian".
Later I decided to "Mexico-American."
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's country, tachography or scripts were not necessary.
He was simply American.
I speak Spanish, well enough to handle myself during an interview in this language.
But I don't have the vocabulary level of a native and I can't get rid of my American accent.
So I took my U.S. passport and put myself in the queue of strangers.
I thought at that time this week that Mexico's elected president, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House to meet President Obama.
On the agenda of the day, as whenever the leaders of these two countries meet, it consisted of immigration, drugs and trade.
Peña Nieto was also wanting to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, one of the reasons why it is so likely that a Mexican will stay in Mexico as if he ventured to go to the United States.
He wants to associate with the United States and Canada and create a European Union-style trade bloc in North America.
In addition, Peña Nieto promised to continue to fight drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not provide details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never remember that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to give up half of their territory at gunpoint.
But for Mexicans, who think in centuries, not in minutes, the elements they remember are everywhere.
So, at the time when a U.S. official says anything that makes Mexico the slightest criticism, you start to hear complaints, both in the press and among Mexican elite, about how Americans are usurping the sovereignty of their neighbours.
And the children of Moctezuma stand at war.
And yet, for Mexico, the relationship that really poses a challenge is that which they have with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
Are we talking about resentment?
There's a lot.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for whom it is not.
The only reason that there are so many people of Mexican descent living in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that, at some point in our family tree, there was a person, perhaps the father or mother or some of the grandparents, who closed the door to the opportunities in Mexico and had to march north.
And most of the time that person fit into a certain profile: dark skin, low level of studies, coming from a poor people, etc.
We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even though we may be living the American dream now, having gone to good schools and had good jobs, we can never lose sight that what we are living is that, the American dream, and not the Mexican.
Sometimes our identity may not be clear, but our loyalty does.
It's for the United States.
Furthermore, we are aware that many Mexicans belonging to the elite of the ruling class do not like us.
The feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look at us above the shoulder as if we were from a lower category that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough and our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
In his view, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
And now we wouldn't be trapped behind this silk curtain, living well in the United States but still as lonely souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and came legally to the United States when she was a girl, reminds me that there is this rock between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans because the first ones know more firmly who they are and in seconds this bothers them.
Although a citizen of the United States, she is considered part of the two countries.
Meanwhile, many Mexican-Americans I know feel they are not part of either.
We love listening to the Mexican group Los Tigers del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You have the best in every country, but you're not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico they see us as Americans.
And in the United States we are considered Mexicans.
Now, to further complicate things, so I learned during my trip, some Mexican leaders and some intellectuals want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as improvised "ambassadors" of Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We would tell our American colleagues how fantastic it is to visit that country and we would pressure political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course...
That's not gonna happen.
There's too much resentment.
And with wage inequality, galloping corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure that it is a fantastic country.
I'm afraid you'll be alone with this idea, friends.
It's fair.
If some Mexicans are not yet prepared to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, then they have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans are still resented for how their family was treated far less.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more Mexicans than I thought.
Old battles, New Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could be an unlikely basis for peace
Will there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain.
In the midst of the useless and usual discussions about who first started, lots of buildings have been reduced to rubble; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed and, for the first time, missiles from Gaza have fallen near Tel Aviv, the Israeli metropolis, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even though Israelis and Palestinians seem to be anchored in their old conflict, everything around them in the Middle East is changing.
Arab spring has left everything to taste or not, Palestinians and Israelis have been trapped in the regional blunder.
Maybe this makes your fight even more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons to believe that their lethal dead point situation could be broken down.
A war that neither loses nor wins
At first glance, optimism now seems very difficult to justify.
Even if the ceasefire was held on 21 November, this week's clashes have strengthened the hawks on both sides.
Hamas leaders, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelis to retreat, despite Gaza having been beaten well.
And despite having killed some of its leaders and put pressure on the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most wretched and impoverished corners of the planet, Israel has not been able to end Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently governed by its relentless rivals of Fatah, the most moderate Palestinian faction.
Furthermore, Hamas leaders could conclude that time plays for them.
Since Islamists have gained influence throughout the Arab world, Hamas has made rich and powerful friendships.
Turkey, a reborn regional power that had previously been the closest Muslim ally to Israel, has embraced the cause of Hamas. Qatar has also done so, one of the richest and most dynamic states in the Gulf.
Exultant members of Hamas say that the half-month Islamist is surrounding Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where the Hizbulah military party dominates, passing through Syria, where the rebels of an increasingly Islamist tendency could overthrow Bashar Assad, until they reach Jordan, where Hamas' allies are threatening the king.
Above all on the southern side of Israel, the growth of Muslim Brothers led by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, unlike the most populous and fundamental Arab countries, has changed the region's balance.
Hosni Mubarak, the lay despot he ruled in Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, did not have too much time for Hamas.
On the other hand, the Muslim Brothers are cousins of Hamas and their leaders depend more on popular opinion.
In future diplomatic actions, Hamas may emerge as the protagonist that cannot be excluded, not even Israel and the United States.
Meanwhile, the hard wing of Israel will draw the opposite conclusion.
As far as the military issue is concerned, they have put Hamas in its place.
The Israel Iron Dome anti-missile system has demonstrated its effectiveness and many of Hamas' missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will sleep more quietly... for some time.
With regard to diplomacy, the United States is stronger than ever; many European countries have also blamed Hamas for starting the last wave of violence.
First of all, Israel has prospered. Especially under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although the rockets fired from Gaza have ended the lives of some 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had too many suicide terrorists, partly thanks to the West Bank barrier, the main part of a region seeking to become a state of Palestine, and protects Jewish settlements that continue to increase despite the illegal status of international law.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose party Likud joined an even tougher line group led by Avigdor Lieberman in the pre-election period on 22 January, was in a good position.
Why pamper these Palestinian twisted people by giving them their own status?
If they really ruled in the West Bank, would they not shoot rockets as their countrymen have done in Gaza?
It's better to have them behind that wall and hit them good if they raise their head.
The hard wing may be imposed, although the Arab spring could alter its calculations.
Although Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere do not appreciate Israel too much, their priority will be to address internal difficulties.
Israel's defence budget is greater than that of its four Arab neighbours together.
Starting a war with the superpower of the area will hardly help new Arab governments improve their economies.
That the pragmatic Mr. Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to get the fire off is a good wish and could mark the beginning of something.
Israelis should also think in the long term.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination means creating a powder that will one day explode in the territories occupied by Israel, just as this week a bus in Tel Aviv exploded.
The repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state and demography worsens the situation as the Arab population increases.
The cruel missions against Gaza every two or three years to reject Hamas will pay an ever-increasing diplomatic toll.
Both sides need a push from people outside the conflict.
The solution remains the one that calls for sensible people from both sides, the majority of the outside world and this newspaper: two states and the assignment of territory by Israel for security reasons.
The hope, small in the short term, is that the ceasefire gives a little more impetus to the strangers who are fighting for this cause.
Egypt, which must begin to stop the entry of arms into Gaza, together with Turkey and Qatar, is in an unprecedented situation to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs outside the matter should also pressure Hamas and Fatah to join.
That would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the imminent attempt to gain a virtual status in the United Nations.
Mr. Obama also has an important role to play in bringing Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term he failed to present his own plan for peace.
Again in the White House, it seems equally reluctant to devote his attention.
This attitude is a deplorable vision of the future.
A stable Middle East is of vital interest to the United States.
This implies a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine.
The generic tobacco packaging law enters into force in Australia
Warnings about the risks of smoking and parts of the body with diseases light on boxes of a green blackout, which are the same for all brands of tobacco
The Australian law on tobacco and generic packaging, pioneering in the world, comes into force and replaces the logos and colors of the brands with an envelope of an olive green blackout, frightening images of parts of the body with diseases and representations of sick children and babies for being children of smoking parents.
Except for the different images and health warnings, the only difference between the boxes, mandatory since Saturday, are the names of the brands, all of them printed in a small source type.
This is the strictest regime in the world applied to tobacco packaging.
The federal government of Australia states that the goal is to deter young people from smoking by eliminating the traits that make this habit glamour.
Trust studies that show that if a person has not started smoking before the age of 26, there is a 99% chance that he will never do so.
"It can be seen that children, even from an early age, understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through their brand," said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that showed, for example, how girls related the logo of a crown to the idea of being a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and these changes will not affect the benefits of multinationals, other countries are considering taking similar measures.
The tobacco industry has exerted enormous pressure against the law.
Tobacco companies claimed that the law would promote the black tobacco market, in which cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible.
"The legislation will have serious involuntary consequences," said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco in Australia.
It will increase the amount of tobacco that will be brought by counterfeiters from China and Indonesia to sell it on the streets of Australia.
Other people say their business has benefited after the approval of the law.
Sandra Ha, from Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said that the demand for silicone bedclothes and blankets to cover the unpleasant images of the boxes had been fired almost from scratch two months ago, when the British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a refusal to the law in the Supreme Court of Australia.
Ms. Ha stated that Zico had sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale establishments and was waiting for more stocks.
"It's a good business for us."
According to experts, the potential obstacle is the popularity of social networks between the demographic sector to which the plan is directed.
Following a series of Australian laws prohibiting advertising on television and sponsorship of sports and forcing most sellers not to put cigarettes in sight, tobacco marketing has become online.
Australia has banned advertising on the Internet to local companies and websites, but cannot restrict it on foreign pages.
"If you sell tobacco and only have this small window left to promote your products, online space is the most convincing place to be," said Becky Freeman, public health researcher at Sydney University.
Freeman noted an increase in reviews of brands from "walking citizens" published on social media websites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
Whether it is just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and has been upset about making a video or whether any marketing company is behind it all.
Australia's British American Tobacco indicated that the industry focuses more on what new regulations involve than on marketing.
The industry has even come to pay for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to reject the new rules; these countries are affirming to the World Trade Organization that trade is being unfairly restricted, despite the fact that none of these countries have a significant volume of trade with Australia.
The WTO is likely to deliver a resolution in mid-2013.
Libersek stated that the government had held talks with other countries that are considering applying similar laws on tobacco packaging.
In 2001 Canada became the first country to introduce the obligation to include images in the boxes.
They are currently mandatory in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
In Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India, tougher laws are being considered.
In Australia many smokers are challenging.
"Photos don't affect me.
I simply don't listen to them."
"Take the cigarette and keep the package," says Victor El Hage while buying a package with the image of a tumor in his mouth.
"Really, there is only one reason why I would stop smoking: for my daughter."
James Yu, King of the Pack pond manager in central Sydney, indicates that uniform boxes make it more complicated to put them on shelves.
"It usually took an hour to unload a delivery; now I'm late four," says Yu.
"The government should have totally banned tobacco and then, okay, it's over and we're closing the store," he says as he lifts his hands up.
In a constantly connected world, it's not so bad to get a little bored
During this year's Thanksgiving parties, I unexpectedly had to spend five hours at an airport because the plane on which we flew suffered a mechanical problem and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So I had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spending half a day at an airport waiting for a flight is quite boring, even if you have the means to be entertained, such as books, magazines or iPhones, without forgetting about duty-free shops.
But there are more and more academics and experts in child development who praise the kindness of boredom.
According to them, it is good that we and our children both get bored from time to time.
Boring forces the brain to look for interesting options and may encourage creativity.
Since most of us are currently connected to this or that screen, we do not experience the benefits of boredom.
So, should we accept boredom in good spirits?
Yeah.
And no.
But we'll talk about it later.
First, like many people, it was assumed that, now that we have more time for leisure, boredom would be a relatively recent phenomenon.
But, as Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman History at the University of Calgary, Canada, says, and author of the book "Boredom: A Lively History" ("The Boring, An animated History") published in 2011 by Yale University Press, is not so.
"In fact, the history of boredom is very extensive," he says.
On the walls of Pompeii there are Latin graffiti on the boredom dating from the first century AD.
We must also consider how we define boredom.
"The problem is that it has already been defined and discussed in many ways," says John D. Eastwood, professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After examining the published research and raising the idea before a discussion group of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as the experience of "wanting, but unable, to participate in an activity that fills you."
He claims that the difference between boredom and apathy is that the person does not do anything but wants to do it.
He points out that there is no desire to do anything with apathy.
The main experience of boredom, he says, is "the alteration of the care process, associated with a low mood and a feeling that time passes slowly."
Boring may sound awfully like depression.
However, Professor Eastwood says that while they may be related, people who are bored tend to view the problem as a matter of the environment or the world, while people who are depressed consider the problem to have it.
Sometimes we think we're bored, when what really happens to us is that we have trouble concentrating.
In his study "The Uncommitted Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", published in the September edition of the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues referred to an earlier experiment in which participants heard a tape of a person reading the article of a magazine.
Some groups heard in the next room a television program at any volume that had no relationship, others heard it with the low volume, so it was barely perceptible, while the third group did not listen to the audio at any time.
The group that listened to the program with the low volume showed more boredom than the other two groups; it cost them to concentrate, but they were not sure why and attributed it to boredom.
"When you try to focus on a difficult or interesting task, the alteration of attention can lead to boredom," said Mark J. Fenske, professor of Neuroscience at Guelph University, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
"On the other hand, when you're doing something boring, like detecting defective parts on a manufacturing line, a music that distracts you can help you not to get bored."
"In fact, at present we know that moving or making squirts, actions that are often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can actually help fight it, as it makes that person physically more alert."
"Research shows that those children who are allowed to move learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to be quiet," says Professor Fenske.
We all know what it is like to get bored at some point: the delay of an airplane, a monotonous speaker, a particularly boring film.
But some people tend to get bored more than others.
To help measure it, some researchers developed in the 1980s a "scale of tendency to boredom".
The scale includes issues like "many of the things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous" and "there are so many things that I'm interested in that I don't have time to do everything."
Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, says that, using these scales, researchers have discovered that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, and specifically need more external and more varied stimulation.
In general, however, adolescents are a type of group that is quite easily bored.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted 400 adolescents and his parents seven to eight times a day through a search.
He found that 32 percent of teenagers said he was bored while in school or doing homework, while 23 percent said he was bored when he was not in school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether the current boredom rates, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he said what he did know was that "adolescence is a period when boredom reaches its highest odds", largely because both children and adolescents are not given great control over what they want to do.
So back to my question at the beginning: Is it good to get bored?
Sometimes it is not, because, led to the extreme, it can make us expose ourselves to absurd physical risks, such as betting or falling into substance consumption as a method of combating it, as shown by research.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers speak of the connection between boredom and creativity, says Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying this issue for more than two decades.
"The boredom is the way the brain has to tell you that you should be doing something else," says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn't always know what's most appropriate.
If you're bored and use that energy to play the guitar or cook, you'll be satisfied.
But if you see TV, it may satisfy you in the short term, but not in the long run.
"So if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he may no longer be bored, but he will not have learned to entertain himself or dosify himself," says Professor Fenske.
And "that ability to dose applies to other situations," he says.
Your child not only learns to enjoy himself but also learns to control himself better in other areas.
I don't think we really want to praise boredom.
But neither should we be too critical of him.
Our objective should be, rather, to feel comfortable away from the constant rumor of activities and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"In our view, we need to get bored more, but boredom is a desire too distressing and disturbing as to relate it to something worth it," he says.
It points out that what people are really looking for is a way to disconnect and enjoy a dead time.
"In an environment where we are constantly overstimulated," he says, "it is difficult to find ways to focus our attention when the noise stops."
Colorado: no instruction book for the new marijuana consumption law
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old student in a community institute and football player in Southeast Colorado, is facing a criminal trial for something that will soon be legal throughout the state: possession of marijuana stones and a pipe he used to smoke it.
Orozco says that one September day, he and some friends drove along Lamar, on the plains near the Kansas border, when the police stopped them.
The police found marijuana in the car and some time later Orozco received a court summons for possession of drugs and related items (minor crimes that each carry a fine of US$ 100) in which he was informed of the date of the trial.
"They treat us like criminals," Orozco says.
And they are?
In the weeks of uncertainty following the vote that took place in Colorado for the legalization of the possession of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the response in hundreds of minor causes due to drug possession depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of minor crimes due to marijuana possession are being cancelled both here and in the state of Washington, where a similar measure was adopted.
Police departments have ceased to file charges against those over the age of 21 for small-scale possession, which will be legally approved once the law has entered into force in the coming weeks.
But Colorado's most conservative district prosecutors have pledged to proceed with open cases of marijuana possession and are still quoting people.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains, are voting to prevent the newly authorized marijuana stores being opened in their communities.
"All this is changing so quickly that I don't know what will be next," said Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, just east of Denver.
Those who take care of the regulations in the state of Washington are also turning the matter around.
And they continue to seek advice to establish a system of production, manufacturing, distribution and sale licences; all of this before the deadline comes on 1 December 2013.
They say that for good or for bad, Colorado goes ahead of most states in terms of regulating the use of marijuana, first for therapeutic purposes and now for recreational use.
"Colored has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide," says Brian E. Smith, spokesperson for the Washington State Alcohol Control Commission.
But Mr Smith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions about what might work.
"There is no true precedent that serves as a model," he says.
The Washington Act, called I-502, enters into force on December 6, which also leaves a year during which it will swim between two waters, since the licensing system in that state will not yet exist, but possession will be legal.
In addition, there are some sensitive mechanical issues that need to be resolved during that period, such as maintaining a balance between the state's requirement to provide "adequate access" to authorized marijuana and its prohibition of carrying out cannabis business on a radio of less than 300 metres from schools, parks, playgrounds or children's centres.
"Nowhere will it be more difficult to locate a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area," says Ben Livingston, spokesperson for the Centre for Legal Cannabis, a recently created research group.
On 21 November, Oates, Aurora's chief of police, sent an e-mail to his police officers informing them that the city's prosecutor would no longer file legal proceedings for minor marijuana offences to persons over the age of 21 and that the police would no longer file charges against these crimes "with immediate effect".
Police chief Oates said that they would be responsible for enforcing the city's rules governing marijuana cultivation for therapeutic purposes and that they would continue to pursue drug traffickers and sellers.
In Weld County, in northern Colorado, district prosecutor Ken Buck represents a stricter view.
After the vote, he assured that his office would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to pressure consumers and decide to receive treatment.
At present, 119 people face charges for possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many of them have other charges.
"Our office has an obligation to bring judicial action against those crimes that occurred at the time they occurred were a crime," said Mr Buck in a statement.
The response has been complicated even in places such as the rural county of Mesa, where voters rejected the initiative on the legalization of marijuana.
Grand Junction police, the county's largest city, no longer cites adults for small quantities.
Pete Hautzinger, district attorney, supported this decision, but also decided not to dismiss any of the cases pending for possession.
"I don't think he's wasting his time by continuing to enforce the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of voters supported the measure, it was never considered that taking marijuana consumption for recreational use within the government and the judicial system would be easy.
The contradictory reactions that arise throughout the state show a marked ambivalence among officials regarding the great ecological experiment in this state.
"It is a cultural barrier with district prosecutors," says Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents those accused of possession of marijuana and who is a local spokesman for the National Law Reform Organization on marijuana.
"They have spent so much time bringing people to the courts that, in fact, they still cannot accept it to be legal," he said.
Being the first states to consider small amounts of marijuana in the same way as if it were alcohol, Colorado and Washington are preparing to become domestic testing cases in terms of drug legalization.
While lawyers and state officials have a new legal sales border, they also look forward to receiving indications from the federal government, which still provides for the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal offences.
Defenders of the legalization of marijuana have the hope that the Department of Justice will give in.
Although there have been some outstanding arrests of patients and salesmen of marijuana for therapeutic purposes, the federal government has mostly allowed there to be sales of marijuana for these purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 more states.
"Although it is likely that anti-drug agents will not throw doors down to confiscate a small drug bag, they will probably show reluctance to allow the operation of state-regulated stores for the sale of marijuana for recreational use, permitted in the new law," said Kevin A. Sabet, a drug policy overloader from Obama's administration.
Several cities in Colorado do not expect federal authorities to act.
Even before the day of the elections, some local governments approved moratoriums on any new marijuana store, although it will be about a year before any of them can open.
Last week, the western city of Montrose adopted a six-month ban and it is likely to be approved next week.
"We don't want to put ourselves in a situation where we authorize someone and then have a serious problem at the federal level," said Bob Nicholson, city member.
"Our community voted against this amendment.
We are studying in favour of what the community voted against in favour of what the state voted for."
A lot of questions arise about this.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was harassed until I got kicked out of Oxford for being a Tory."
You don't attack college students from your point of view just now
I don't remember any time in my life that I haven't been dreaming of getting a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had been in what I assumed was the best place in the world to learn, a Greek symposium of the contemporary era that fostered the two pillars of civilization: free thought and tolerance.
However, two weeks after I took my place at Worcester College in the late 1980s to pursue the history race, I had already packed my bags, triggering the first scandal in my life.
My father collapsed and cried.
My friends were confused.
The Newspaper The Evening Standard stated that I had abandoned because I did not tolerate some university colleagues having sexual intercourse in the next room.
Writer A. N. Wilson announced joking that I was gone because they forced me to drink in empty cups.
The truth was less fun.
I got out of there.
Yes, I did, because I had been subjected to systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of my extravagant name, nor because it came from a private school.
I was harassed for one reason only, which in the cradle of the so-called illustration was somewhat intolerant and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a prominent adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I supported the conservative party.
Maybe they wonder what that comes to right now.
Well, several reports indicate that a new generation of right centre students is undergoing similar persecution.
Institutionalized and growing hatred of conservative party students is such in Oxford that, last week, a group of them claimed the same level of equal rights as homosexuals, the disabled and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the JCR (group of graduate students) of Corpus Christi College claim that they are "often seriously separated, personally attacked and treated as non-grate people" by their political ideas.
They want to create a position on the Equal Opportunities Committee of their college to ensure that they can express their views freely.
His situation was not favored by a recent BBC2 documentary called "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" on student policy and presenting the Tories as eccentric and neo-Nazis.
He showed the graduate student Joe Cooke, president of the Conservative Party Association of the University of Oxford (OUCA), in a Rolls-Royce, wearing a silver suit and a cane with a silver handle.
At other universities, conservative students say they are treated as "Turkish head" by the introduction of higher enrolment rates.
Luke Black, aged 20 and vice-president of the Conservative Party Association of the University of Nottingham, stated in a Sunday newspaper that "there is a growing trend of left-wings in universities.
People assume we're like the Bullingdon Club without even meeting us."
Samuel Roberts, aged 21 and a student of history in Corpus Christi who presented the motion for greater protection, states that this environment is "uncomfortable", while Stephanie Cherill, aged 19 and elected president of OUCA, states that the attitude of JCR members towards people who are on the right centre has worsened.
"This poses a threat to the intellectual debate environment, as well as to the welfare of members," he says.
During my first weeks in Oxford, I was more alone than one.
I went to college in September 1986, was a very shy 18-year-old.
Hatred for the Conservative Party was at its highest point.
The previous year, the university had voted to deny Margaret Thatcher, an old student, a title "honoris causa" after the cuts in the financing of Higher Education.
The atmosphere would have made any Stalinist tremble.
Already during the first days of the week to welcome the new university students, when the new students met and met the professors, I received a sample of the bitterness I expected.
I discovered that not only did the professors look fat at the ridicule that was made of conservative university students, but they were willing to participate in it.
The policy of the mining strike, the privatization and opposition of the government to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa reached the seminary's wooden chambers.
The first one I attended was to translate into English French texts from the 18th century and I was not prepared for what came next.
"Mrs. Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (already deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
Not one.
Pitt, a man with a face that looked like a biscuit mass, knew well how to expel bad bile.
"Are the thacherists refusing to learn French or are they simply fools?" he asked.
The other college students laughed.
My eyes were burning with tears that I was trying to contain.
"I suggest you go to French classes in your spare time, as long as you're not too busy meeting people," Pitt grumbled.
I returned to my room as a sorrowful soul.
That night I felt alone at dinner at the university; then I felt a slight slap on my back.
He was a second-year English student named James who presented himself as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
"I'm afraid that's how it goes.
They mess with anyone who's suspected of being Tory.
It's very complicated for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so for you it'll be even worse.
Many newly arrived Tories appear to be laborists."
Later, in a local pub, I tried cowardlyly to cover it up.
I insisted that I disagreed with everything Mrs Thatcher said.
That trick turned out to be useless.
A first-year student from Philosophy, Politics and Economics who, paradoxically, had studied in Eton, said: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You're contaminated."
Other students adopted that song.
I became the dirty pervert.
"How do the Tories have sex?" asked one.
"They beat each other, don't they?"
I felt the same way homosexuals should have felt before the liberal law of the 1960s.
Could you ever live a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to stay with people who thought like me only after nightfall?
Should I become a labourer and suppress my natural tendencies?
The three years that awaited me were presented as a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only open professor Tory was Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History for my college.
They hated him for being not only the Conservative party, but also Thatcher's advisor in foreign policy and one of the people who wrote his speeches to him.
I was just out there.
He hated the place because he considered it provincial and insignificant and because of his adherence to the Marxist-determinist vision of history.
In 1997, he accepted a chair at the University of Bilkent, Ankara, Turkey.
"You're not going to be happy here," he said.
I started moving daily from Oxford to my parents' home in London, finding refuge in my most open-minded family and friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He didn't believe me.
When he studied there in the 1940 ’ s, all political views were accepted.
"But if it's the best place in the world," he said sadly.
"They would never do that, not there among my dear dream needles.
Even my communist friends always had an impeccable attitude."
His painful eyes began to cloud.
"Give him another chance.
I'm sure they did it just to make fun of it.
My heart would break if you let it."
Tired of so many trips to London, my emotional resistance was deteriorating.
A friend of mine, who also supported the Conservative Party, had succumbed to pressure and renounced his belief.
The following week, during a seminary where another professor of history had insinuated, speaking entirely seriously, that I was an "enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Red of shame inside, I admitted that my parents had "washed my brain" and called them "stupid old men."
The truce lasted a little while.
It was my father who put the last nail in the coffin of my college career in Oxford.
By that time my father wrote two weekly columns in Murdoch's press.
My door was locked.
I was surrounded by fear and, five minutes ago, my persecutors gave up.
When they left, I picked up the first train to London.
I never came back.
Maybe you call me weak crying.
But no 18-year-old person should be subjected to such a level of intimidation and hostility in an educational institution.
What is even more tragic is that it was Oxford, who has not only trained 14 Prime Ministers of the Conservative Party but is currently hiding behind a reputation that is not worth equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
On the occasion of the "Valentino: Master of Costura" exhibition, which was inaugurated this week in London, ABC talks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous Italian designer customers
Somerset House, former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer has recognized it during the inauguration of "Valentino: Master of Costura", a retrospective apotheosotics that gathers more than 130 seam dresses created by its "maison" over the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This sample is the colophon of a story whose only protagonist is "the lord" Garavani, but it could not have been written without its distinguished clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the backward and distant world of nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until next 3 March, they abound in private letters and photos with the signature of the most grenade in the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, passing through Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita of England.
Valentino teaches these personal memories as trophies of his social promotion: humble modisto of the city of Voghera, in northern Italy, to the idol of the international jet-set.
Being in love with royalty has nothing wrong.
"At least they don't turn off their nipples on your magnificent carpet like some beautiful pop music celebrities," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and maintains with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved to be invited to your cottage in Gstaad," explains the exwife of "Heini" Thyssen, intimate of forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And yet, it's a star.
Valeria Mazza, shining a Valentine's Day
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza also forgets the charisma of the modisto.
Many years ago, after a parade in Piazza di España, in Rome, we went to dinner on his floor.
There were twenty of us, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of the floor, the decoration, the food, the music, in everything was seen and felt his spirit.
"Each of the guests made us feel important and loved," recalls the "top model", which began working with him during the High Costura Week in Paris in 1995.
"It never passes by fashion because its designs are works of art," he ends.
Alcurnia show
Garavani's life is not a story of obsessions, but of well-received love.
He loves people with good education and better titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous 60-meter long walkway that proposes a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and must parade through the gateway to contemplate a dream "a hearing" that lights up Valentino's masterpieces, such as the dress Jackie Kennedy chose for his wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the clothing that Monica Vitti used in "La Notte", or a wool and skin coat that belonged to the Empress Farah Diba.
In this mannequin audience names such as the one in Sibilla in Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit in Norway, Rosario in Bulgaria or Sofia in Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the Modisto, 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentine is like the first love, "not to forget."
I remember it perfectly.
It was a trousers, a shirt, a vest "gillette" and a jacket from the Fall-Winter 1971-1972 collection.
"It was a gift he gave me," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's museums.
"I prefer him above others for his femininity, for his great love for women, because he enhances our beauty," adds the former Duchess of Fairy.
I really like the colors you use, they have great light and they're "donors" on your face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and fashion prescriptor Patricia della Giomppaola d'Arenbergtampoco can forget the first time she saw a Valentine.
When he was a teenager and lived in Italy, he dreamed of getting to age and opportunity to wear one of his night suits...
Finally, the time came in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino dress to wear at a party in my cousin's castle, Prince Edouard of Ligne.
It was a red suit, with flying skirt, "corsage" flagged and escort word of honour.
"It was a dream come true," says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his obsession is the timeless," explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her fashion party dresses with "the best care... because a dress isn't just a dress, it's also the set of memories she carries."
The "king" of fashion
The grand finale of the Somerset House exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress with Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "girls" (as the modisto calls their seams) to develop that ivory silk suit with pearl inlays, twelve different lace types and a four-and-a-half-foot tail.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority of the specialized press, that dress represents a milestone in the high seas of the late 20th century, "the return of the customers of the high society".
Over the years with the "know-being" of the elite, Valentino is now his best example.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest ranking distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates as many honours as any of his clients' husbands.
"He has always drawn attention to his refinement, his calmness, his powdery and perfect appearance," acknowledges D'Arenberg.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée de Orsay.
He was at the table of countess Jacqueline of Ribes, a great friend of mine.
"He was impeccable, time doesn't pass for him."
If a princess says so...
The hardest job in the world: the human mules of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, Indonesian volcano carriers play life and health carrying 70 kilos of sulphur through steep stone paths
There are people for whom their work is a hell and another who literally works in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their lives by getting sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, you have to go down every day to the bottom of your crater, where the sulfurous gas emanating from Earth's bowels solidifies by getting in touch with the air.
After removing large rocks of sulphur, which in total reach about 70 kilos, it carries them into two bamboo baskets that carry them on their shoulders through steep stone paths.
It is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to 2,386 meters of altitude, but the exhausted carriers take more than 40 minutes to climb at the tortoise, keeping the balance and carefully measuring their steps so as not to slip and fall down the cliff.
They know that any transplant could cost their lives, as happened to a French tourist who spent years at the risk of Kawah Ijen.
Kawah Ijen miners earn 5 cents of euro for every pound of sulphur they extract
Once up, there is a passage between tourists photographing them as circus monkeys and, carrying the heavy baskets, they walk three kilometers to the balance that a mining company has located a little below, at 1,850 meters high.
It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been exploiting the volcano since 1960 and, never better said, its workers, who pay 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents of euro) for each kilo of sulphur.
Then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents of euro) to the petrochemical industry, as this mineral is generalized in everyday life and is used to manufacture bezels, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to bleach sugar.
"As normal is to load 70 kilos, we take out about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) on each trip," explains Anto, who usually performs three daily ports.
It takes three hours each and ends ground, but allows you to gather 18,000 rupees (11.5 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems a misery for such inhumane effort, it is the triple of what would gain in the field.
"The mining newspaper is very high here, where the coffee collection is paid to 15,000 rupees (€1.2) the day and the average monthly wage is two million rupees (167 euros) ", the carrier, who used to work as an albañil on the touristic island of Bali, explains.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) per day and the cut was not so hard, but Anto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a people close to the volcano, for a reason of weight that, in Indonesia, is as loud as the sulfur: "I married a young Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought her to Java to convert to Islam."
Then he has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes get irritated by toxic gases
At the age of 27, Then he has three playing the skin in the Kawah Ijen, whose sulfur has already begun to bill him despite covering his face with a mask and special glasses.
She has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly, and her eyes are irritated by toxic gases that fire the volcano.
It's the price you have to pay to get your dream.
"I will work two more years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French," he promises in a more than acceptable English.
Punished for life, this friendly and intelligent young man could be a tourist guide, waiter or receptionist at a hotel, but instead he does the job of a mule.
Sharing an unclean wooden cabin with other carriers, it rises every day at two in the morning because the sulfur does not stop at night, when its characteristic yellow color becomes blue and shines in the middle of the darkness.
Defying the shadows, then down to the crater nestling with a small flashlight attached to his helmet, which he himself has bought with his money.
Some 400 carriers carry the sulfur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater
Despite its small profits, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of sulphur to save costs or supply any equipment to the carriers, who work on their own and to both weight.
In fact, they do not even see any of the 30,000 rupees (€2.5) of charge per camera that, next to the entrance of 15,000 rupees (€1.2), the guards of this nature park charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This work is for animals and not for people," said Madrusin, a 42-year-old carrier who has been in Kawah Ijen for three decades since leaving school.
Able to raise up to 110 kilos, he says he will endure working "everything he can" because he needs the money to educate his three children, aged 18 to 10.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life.
Although the sulfur burns the throat and chooses the eyes when the wind changes suddenly and catches the miners in the thick columns that come out of the volcano, they are so hard that no one complains about suffering serious diseases... beyond, of course, of their usual respiratory problems, arthrosis, knee pain and sores on the shoulders, which have been distorted by the weight of the baskets.
By swinging the basket on its back, Unainik can only load 50 kg at his 53 years of age.
Every day, he and his companions pull 15 tons of sulphur into the volcano, which three trucks move to the Tamasari warehouse, 18 kilometers away along a goat road between the trunk.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life," says Unainik opening his mouth well, where several teeth are missing.
Of his five children, the eldest, 30 years old, also works carrying sulphur.
Time passes, but misery perpetuates from generation to generation one of the hardest trades in the world: the one who makes the human mules of the Kawah Ijen.
Singapore looks for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame the career, stress and cost of property and education for not having children.
"The population of Singapore needs to grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife, we fulfill our civic duty and we believe in life!
It may seem inverse that these verses are part of an announcement of mint pills, but despite that - or perhaps because of that - the video became viral on YouTube in Singapore early this year.
The phrases are part of a rap using local references such as "We're going to put a bao (ball) in the oven" to laugh at Singapore's birth rate.
The advertising company that made the video, BBH, entertains the hope that with the ad they manage to draw attention to the problem in a fun way.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to make people do their "national duty."
This is something purely internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
It's the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world to reproduce ourselves, so we feel that this was a subject we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as throwing perfumes with pheromones or organizing evenings of quick quotes (speed-dating).
Many of those ideas may have been creative, but they didn't necessarily work.
So we think, why don't we do as creative as possible to solve this problem, which is to compose a rap?
1.2 children
The one who doesn't take it so lightly is the Singapore government.
Spends US$1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for marriage and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a city rich and high-tech state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
Singapore's birth rate, according to its national population division, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2 - known as the replacement rate - it was in 1976.
So why do Singaporeans have no more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policy, National Population Division, says it is due to a "better education" and " wider range of career opportunities".
"That has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of goals of life and priorities, beyond getting married and forming a family," he explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase in singleness, and delay in marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
In the meantime, an immigration policy aims to dramatically increase immigration to address the decline in the population has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where xenophobia is abundant, disguised against many new immigrants, particularly Chinese, who are criticized for keeping low wages and not integrating.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year the Singapore government party experienced its worst electoral outcome since independence.
Since the elections there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with higher quotas and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the fall in the birth rate has known effects on a nation's economic growth, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore's example is also having some unexpected consequences.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, it has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development authority has moved to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoe box", which can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have 46 square meters surfaces and have been very successful in sales.
However, there is concern that they can promote a life-style of singleness and discourage developers who want to build large, family-run homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of the El Developers real estate company, says his "shoe boxes" are sold much faster than the larger units.
They are more popular, in the sense that the units are exhausted days, even weeks, faster than the larger units.
This makes it much better for our cash flow.
However, it admits that the new rules provide clearer guidance for developers, who were previously blocked if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.
Too stressed
Singapore is a state city.
While these new rules can be a step towards an increase in the national birth rate, speaking to Singaporeans working in the financial district of the centre that seems to have little effect.
"People are very stressed, houses are expensive and education is too, so many people are putting it off," says a young executive.
Other people may have children.
"But it's important for me to have my own money and time," says another young man about 20 years old.
Men and women mention their career, the stress and cost of property and education as the reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, no matter how much the government tries to push its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, Singaporeans are the ones who have the last word.
Private off line is private on line
Privacy.
According to the Dictionary of the Spanish Royal Academy it is about the quality of private life or "the scope of private life that is entitled to protect from any interference".
What is private for a child under the age of 16?
How does this definition apply in your daily life and in social networks?
Do you understand the dangers you are exposed to by ventilating situations on the Internet that you would certainly not share offline?
The Periodical interviewed five boys between 10 and 15 years old, frequent network users.
In four of the cases, they associated the term with "something very mine", on the personal level, and "in the user's key and name", when they applied it to social networks.
"My deepest secrets would not upload them to a post," says ten-year-old Jorge, when he tries to explain the meaning of private in sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has been counting for two years.
"They are very secret secrets, my mom can know them, but not everyone," she says.
In FB I upload beautiful pictures or games.
I also have fun with my acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a photo that isn't mine, or someone who's doing the ridiculous thing," he says.
The child recognizes that obscene photographs, naked people, crimes or writing humiliating or violent comments are wrong.
Jorge ensures you know the 35 friends he has on FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
The mother is included, she has the key to one of the accounts.
I opened Twitter to express and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I'll just pick them up," he adds.
"Social networks are entertained, I can talk to distant relatives or my friends quickly," he says.
Do not hesitate to reply that you would never accept an application from an unknown person.
I wouldn't listen to anyone who would recommend a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old Joseph is different.
The teenager has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, in the latter he admits not to know 20 of the people added to his list of friends.
"Don't scare me, because we have something in common, music for example," he says.
According to the boy, no one has been insinuated or asked for the address of his home or his phone number.
"If they put pressure on me or demand it simply by the bags of my account," he admits.
José became a follower of Ask, after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is not unfamiliar with the experiences of what is now known as cyberbullying.
An acquaintance of a friend of mine was extorting him into a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"I never knew who he was," he says.
The victim, according to José, did not close the account.
"Just put him in privacy."
Then explain a number of steps to set up the account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in awkward or embarrassing situations.
If I did, I'd either fall ill or I'd like to.
"Although I know that's cyberbullying," he says.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, a teacher in English and a graduate in Education and Learning, believes that to guide children and adolescents it should be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet emerged as a means of searching for information, but with the appearance of these sites they changed the rules of the game," he says.
It is true that academic Marc Prensky, a master in Pedagogy by Yale University and author of the work Natives and Digital Immigrants, coined these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives are them, children and young people who were born with technology.
"We are the digital immigrants we have to teach them when we're still learning," he says.
He comments that the subject is complex, "because we are asking them to have a definite criterion on what is appropriate or not to spread, publish or say at an age that maturity does not give for that."
"They are also selective when they care most about being popular, having thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way of teaching what privacy is for children and adolescents is through questions that make them reflect.
"Tell them not to do it doesn't work," he adds.
Here are some options: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, would you like them to publish a picture of you like the one you published from a friend?
You know what the others publish about you?
When you tag party photos, did you ask permission from other people to label them?
And one more, do everybody need to know what you're doing every moment?
Another point is to make them see that they must act on line as they do off line.
They're the same rules.
"One outside the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, just as it should be on social networks," he says.
Monitoring
Stuart Guardia, university professor, primary professor and educational consultant, notes that it is essential for family parents to read social media policies consciously.
In understanding each of the indents they have solid grounds for talking with their children about the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to share or publish," he says.
According to Guardia, it is key to remind children of the lesson of "do not talk to strangers".
Finalizes Unasur Summit without making the Lima Declaration public
The Sixth Presidential Summit of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur) concluded today in Peru without the publication of the Lima Declaration, previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven assistant representatives.
Ephe tried repeatedly to access the document signed at the 6th Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but sources of Foreign Affairs and Presidency indicated at an early stage that it would be delivered after the closure, but then stated that it would be published on the Peruvian Government ' s website at some point.
Upon being consulted by the text, they noted that the content had been presented by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during a few brief statements to the press.
The access of journalists to information at the Summit was restricted at all times.
During the day only the soundless video of the presidential assembly was broadcast in the press room with the message "private session, restricted audio".
The little information circulated among the reporters was delivered by the press speakers of some of the government of Unasur attending the meeting, although not Peruvian.
The only document released during the day was the list of assistant presidents, which caused the discomfort of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media asking for more data.
Subsequently, the Presidency of Peru sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it is Humala's pronunciation, not the official document that closed the summit.
Last October, Peru was the host of the Third Arab South American Summit (ASPA), and on that occasion, despite being constantly demanded by the press, neither was the so-called Lima Declaration also announced.
On the ASPA official website, it can be confirmed that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international appointments, the Peruvian authorities made efforts to ensure that there were secured transmission systems for all journalists but to the maximum extent limited the availability of information.
The summit also concluded with Chile and Peru ' s joint commitment to accept a decision by the Hague Court to resolve a border dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and ratified that they will respect the decision of the (CIJ), which begins on Monday in The Hague to hear the allegations of both parties, in the process Lima filed against Santiago.
"We will take and execute the sentence that defines the differences we are bringing to this international court today," said Humala, next to his Chilean partner.
"Chile has been, is and will continue to be, a country that respects international law, the peaceful settlement of disputes, treaties and international courts," Piñera added, and greeted Humala with a handshake, alongside the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation of both presidents that they would be submitted to the ICJ occurred after Colombia had denounced this week the Bogotá Pact by which it had agreed to submit to the judgements of that international court, after a decision on maritime limits with Nicaragua which it considered to be seriously wrong.
The summit was held with the inconsistency of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the removal of its former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the appointment.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was responsible for opening the discussions in the morning and closing the summit shortly after the noon of Lima.
The representative read the outcome document in which he reported that 16 agreements had been adopted and the lines of action had been set for 31 projects among South American countries for a total of $17 billion in investment.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that UNASUR countries will take "significant steps towards the goal of South American citizenship for what we are expanding residence agreements".
He reported that actions are being taken to improve "cooperation in the fight against citizen insecurity and transnational organized crime, actions to make medicines more accessible, low-price Internet access across all corners of South America, and to address jointly and efficiently the risks of natural disasters".
With a Europe in crisis, "economic consolidation (from Latin America) must not have a triumphant matrix but must serve to expand our productive matrix and envision a better future for our peoples," added Humala.
"We have decided to privilege a group of 31 emblematic projects that will improve the connection of South America's spaces, especially in rural and border areas... by joining our countries and generating new economic circuits," said the Peruvian president in a read message.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five correspond to Peru, and are located on the transversal axes of their territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two point to a greater connection with Ecuador, although he did not provide further details.
The outcome document also mentioned the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve for its reintegration into the Union of South American Nations," which is currently excluded from it.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated, and good relations between neighbours, was another of the issues underlined by the summit.
In this regard, the president of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before beginning his participation in the regional appointment that he hoped to meet with his partner from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to treat the maritime dispute respectfully after a decision by the ICJ, questioned by Bogotá.
"The morning (Saturday) is likely to have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
"We are going to review all these paths, they are not exclusive, even the treaty with Nicaragua will require a conversation with Nicaragua," he said.
"With President Ortega I hope to tell you that we handle this as civilized and respectful as possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega would meet on Saturday in Mexico where they plan to attend the takeover of the new president of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Also, as part of the summit, the Ministers of Defence of the bloc met in advance to adopt the 2013 Plan of Action, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay integrate UNASUR, although the last country is suspended.
Peru has the pro-tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from Europe to integrate a citizenship": Rafael Correa
Ecuador's president, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which "South America, in this case yes, must learn from Europe".
Correa, who participated in the 6th Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), held in Lima, told the state TV Peru that Europeans "were killed in World War II" and in other conflicts, "but now they are virtually a country".
In that regard, he defended the project of establishing South American citizenship that encourages the member countries of Unasur.
"We must achieve the free mobility of citizens and workers from any South American country, as already happens with members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to return us to the past," he warned.
The Ecuadorian president also supported the recomposition of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the premise of lowering the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who have signed the San José Covenant on Human Rights.
Those who give the chair never commit themselves to anything, and instead we South Americans sign everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under the funding of the United States," he said in alluding to the political asylum given by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa claimed that she is not sorry for that decision because she has not betrayed her principles, but has respected her "deep democratic values and human rights".
He added that, at the time, "there were well-founded suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that his process would not be respected."
He also criticized Swedish justice for demanding interrogation on his territory for a alleged sexual offence when "Sweden legislation itself allows it to be carried out by videoconferencing, which could be done from the Embassy of Ecuador in London."
Correa stated that there is a risk that Assange's physical and mental health will deteriorate.
"I haven't spoken to him since he was in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, nothing serious," said Ecuadorian representative.
What does exist is the danger of deteriorating your physical and mental health by being confined in a small space without being able to do outdoor exercises.
"That complicates the health of anyone," he added.
Correa noted that the solution to asylum granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, through the granting of a safe pipeline allowing him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities and stressed that there has been talks with London in search of a solution to the closure of the WikiLeaks founder.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been ongoing discussions.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, is doing a number of procedures at different European levels," he mentioned.
And he thought that "if Britain gives tomorrow the safe conduct this is over."
And if Sweden, as perfectly permitted by its legislation and as it has done in other cases, asks Mr Assange at the Embassy of Ecuador in London or asks him via Skype tomorrow this problem is over.
Correa used to reaffirm herself as a defender of freedom of the press and argued that what she does not tolerate is "mediocrity, bad faith and lies, which distort freedom of expression".
"The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not evil and wicked politicians but evil journalists based on profit, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In that respect, it was welcomed that these journalists were no longer "the bankers and the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador", and that being re-elected "will deepen in the revolution to continue the right path and direction."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain Paraguay's veto in the Unasur at least until its next elections, arguing that the body "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and legalism" because in reality "has destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguay's democracy".
The Ecuadorian president also considered the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to now negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime limits between the two countries following the decision of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which benefited Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
At the moment, this fault is not taken into account.
It is a problem between a South American and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
They need to be processed extensively to overcome them and move on.
He also trusted in a good conclusion of the dispute over maritime limits that remain in the same court of Peru and Chile and believed that "it is right for Latin America to seek international bodies if both countries undertake to accept judgement as hard as it may be".
Referring to the possibility that he will apply for the next presidential election in Ecuador to seek a third consecutive mandate, he noted that he sees this possibility "with much optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite hard".
Correa assured that if it loses its February 2013 start, it will withdraw from public life.
In the staff I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unfair as that of Ecuador that socio-economic poverty can only be corrected from political power.
"My political movement believed it was I who guaranteed that probable victory, for we have to accept that responsibility," he said.
Winning would be my last period in the presidency and then we came out of public life.
If we lose the same.
"It's a decision," he said.
Correa also referred to the new health treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just talked to Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro and he tells me that he traveled to a treatment that was already planned, routinely, that he was expected to pass the campaign to return to Cuba.
"It doesn't mean a relapse into President Chávez's state of health," he said.
The Ecuadorian Head of State participated today in Lima at the Sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS deaths today are the cause of late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed as a result of the test: positive AIDS.
"It was like I dropped a bomb," referring to remembering the moment of the announcement, that the doctor was trying to make "softer," without obvious success.
The boy hid his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to inform himself about it; with such an effort that he had already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
It is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV Unit of the Guadalajara Civil Hospital (HCG), which arrived in 1994 after several battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 1990s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
So even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye to him "because he brought a cut."
So having AIDS was synonymous with death.
It is now possible to survive this syndrome and do so with quality of life.
However, ignorant of their disease, many people still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, "exhausted" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
At 31 years of the emergence of AIDS in the world, at least the first reported cases, "the great achievement now means that the survival of a patient who starts treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," said HCG's head of HIV Unit Jaime Andrade Villanueva, after reporting that this information was endorsed in April this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectologist and HIV/AIDS expert Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS was not a fatal sentence, but the years of survival and quality of life depend on the extent to which patients are affected by the immune system when starting the diagnosis, with better expectations for non-drug users: up to 30 years old with a CD4 count and 50 years old, when reporting 500 CD4.
In simple words, the above means that whoever receives the diagnosis of HIV positive at 25 years of age under these terms "while remaining in control can live without problems up to 75 years," the interviewee explained.
To shape this advance, it should be recalled that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years on average.
Although mortality has decreased significantly in recent years, in Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS has fallen from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 ( UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that since the onset of AIDS, 60 per cent of patients in the national database have died.
Only in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and there are 187 deaths until May this year; however, universal access to antiretroviral drugs has been ensured since 2005.
- Why are there still deaths?
- I don't think the problem is access to treatment.
So I see it, so it's happened to us in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we have not had enough medicine the problem is that patients get very advanced because they do not know their status of infection, that is, in late stages of the disease.
He said: "Nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have some opportunistic infection what needs to be done to have a greater impact on global mortality, is to make early diagnoses and, therefore, they must offer evidence of detection in a massive way, to all people who require it."
His proposal coincides with experts and officials of the State Council for AIDS Prevention in Jalisco (Coesida), also patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who came to test a particular laboratory, only motivated because a friend had done it and, despite their short age, was already in stage of AIDS and even suffered from Kaposi sarcoma, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die and they don't want to know anything.
"If I'm going to die now, I'd better come back three times a week," they say no to me.
The change was to improve, feed me well, exercise, take the medication.
To date, his parents only know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like anyone else.
"I work, I have many activities, I travel, I have an active sexual life, but corresponding, I take care of myself and the other person," said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to motivate with his testimony those today, in the framework of World AIDS Day, are afraid.
Let the test be done, if they were at risk, that the sooner they know if they are HIV positive, it is better and if they already have the diagnosis, they learn that they can live like anyone, being responsible.
That, your message, summarizes the battle slogan for AIDS this year 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
Large are the gaps between health programs and the common citizen, said Ricardo Salazar, a Tapatio journalist who has taken the cause around HIV.
And the biggest one is in prevention.
In places dedicated to this task "the distribution of condoms has actually increased, before they gave us one or two, now they give us packages of a hundred, and that's very good but it turns out there are those who still have no access to a condom," he said.
Teenagers are among the most vulnerable to new infections.
"Why do you want them?" is a common question, with sorno and valuable judgments of social workers, school counselors, pharmacists and health personnel, to whom adolescents are not exposed, assured the communicator.
He proposed reorienting this ineffective distribution; that condoms not only be after the displays and those hundred are in public bathroom dispatchers from the sites that frequent young people.
It's not motivating promiscuity.
It is not about paying them the chelas and the motel, as Governor Emilio González replied, asking him if he would have distributed condoms in his administration.
"That's not sexuality, it's best to bring condoms closer to those who already engage in sexual activity," he said.
Keys in Jalisco
There are 13,435 cases accumulated (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is 4th national place in new and accumulated cases of AIDS and 13th HIV.
92% of the infections correspond to the sexual route, 6% to the blood route and 2% to the perinatal route.
It is estimated that 50,000 people may be living with HIV as there are 4 to 5 people who do not know about it for a recorded case.
Ratified by a U.S. Appeals Court a judgment which does not know the debt restructuring of the Vitro Group achieved through a trade competition in Mexico, the scenario sets a bad precedent for any national company with ramifications in the neighbouring country having solvency problems.
It would therefore be said that the downstream procedures for the survival of signatures that allow Mexican laws are not valid in the country of bars and stars, contrary to international conventions.
In the practical field, the backlog to the judgment issued on 15 June last by Judge Harlin Hale of the Court of Banking Routes for the northern district of Texas, leaves defenseless to Mexican firms in the face of the possibility of stopping their properties in the suburbs of Bravo.
However, the resolution opens the door to the leading glass manufacturer in Mexico to the United States Supreme Court, claiming three inconsistencies.
At the outset, while the case judge points out that creditors must be governed by the United States Bankruptcy Act, the Court of Appeals of the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, says that the main proceedings are the trade tender conducted in Mexico.
The first point would imply ignoring international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of transnational corporations.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law for the Uniformity of International Trade Law was created to that end, placing the American Law Institute as arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment provides that without the inter-companies vote, recognised in the critical mass of the commercial tender the debts owed by Vitro’s subsidiaries with their matrix, the majority required to approve the restructuring would not have been achieved.
However, the possibility is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro's has not been the first case in which the scheme is accepted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Mexican Commercial, whose inter-companies debt endorsed the Federal Instituto de Concursos Mercantiles.
The truth is, moreover, that by subtracting the votes of the subsidiaries, in any case the Vitro creditors who fought against him in the United States Courts, i.e. the "buitre" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, will not have achieved a majority.
The vote would have been 45 percent against 37.
The facts are omitted by the Appeals Tribunal.
From another point of view, this blames Vitro for the difficult situation he faced since 2008 in the wake of the serious economic crisis he faced in the United States, hitting the country's collections.
Soon, the signing of the González Sada family will bring an appeal for reconsideration before the appeal court itself for the vote to reach its plenary session, i.e. the five judges, since only three were voted on.
Failure to succeed will result in the application of Cerciorare which requires the review of the proceedings by a higher court, in this case the United States Supreme Court of Justice.
The gravity of the case is that the court recalled a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the figure of amicus curiae ("friend of the Court"), detailing the procedure followed by Vitro under the Trade Competitions Act, noting that it was removed with attachment to the conventions signed by both countries to tie it with Chapter 15 of the United States Banking Act.
Moreover, it was noted that the country had adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. rules for cross-border insolvency cases, which ensured equity for debtors and creditors.
Two-band carabola: they hit Vitro and hit the country.
General Balance
For several months the complaints put on the table by the Mexican Aviation Unions against the company's exduitant, Gastón Azcarraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent administration, has already found the bottleneck.
The instance headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has just filed a criminal complaint against the National Banking and Securities Commission accused of obstruction of justice.
According to this, the supervisory authority has consistently refused to report to the Attorney General's Office of the Republic on an operation carried out by the entrepreneur to extract from Bank IXE's F/589 trust, on behalf of Mexican Aviation, 198 million pesos.
The resources would have been channelled to the purchase of shares of the Professional Hotel Administrator.
As you know, Azcarraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
They're looking for the Dragon Mars.
Meeting on the weekend in a forum at the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and members of civil society generally approved the creation of a broad front to oppose the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
We are talking, as you know, about a huge sales and distribution centre facing Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products in the wall country, with a lime housing area for employees of 150 companies.
Previously, the Canacintra had managed to unify the governors of the south-east zone to oppose the monumental thing that razed with some of the protected areas and raised the mother of all the hideous against the industry.
ACTA Died
Soslayed by the government a requirement of the Senate to explain under what terms and circumstances the Ambassador of Mexico in Japan signed the Anti-Falsification Trade Agreement, known by its acronyms in English as ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property the matter has already passed to the archive.
As you know, the action was given despite the fact that the Senate itself had disqualified the possibility by considering it as an attack on freedom of expression on social networks.
Long-term homex
In order to pay long-term debts without affecting short-term debts, Homex housing developer is placing on the market Bursatile Certificates for 500 million pesos.
The issue is the first of four identicals that offer to pay interest every 28 days.
Birth Competitive
Integrated by NYCE companies, e-Quálity and Kernet, leaders in information technology, a competitive social consortium has just been born, whose objective will be the service market of Central and South America software clusters.
Investment in this area exceeds $1.5 billion.
Hector "Hetin" Kings: "Balance has been my life"
Trotamundos of the basketball Héctor "Hetin" Reyes was more than 60 years connected to the sport of the board and, thanks to him, traveled the whole world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a mental collection of the history of local basketball as wide as Hector "Hetin" Reyes has.
And it's just that before a stroke confined him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in sports for more than 60 years, he was a minor category player, player of the National Superior Basketball, mastered and leader in the BSN with the Bahamón Cowboys or president of the Federation of Basketball.
"I put many hats on my basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time, as when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the National Team and federal president during the 1990s," Reyes recalled during a First Hour visit to his home in Bayamón, where he lived with Isabel, his faithful wife for over 50 years.
"Balance has been my life."
Kings does not exaggerate when making that assertion.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memorabilia that denote his broad trajectory, so they testify.
Bayamón in the heart
Of all, those who cherish with greater emotion are those who remember their passage through the Cowboys from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, when he served for 15 years as co-powered or possessed of franchise.
"These were my best years, the ones I enjoyed most because I had the opportunity to be part of eight Cowboy Championships since 1967, whether as a master, co-power or leader.
It was many years of satisfaction, including the five championships raced from 1971 to 1975.
And then I got fired with one in 1981, Jerome Mincy's debut year at the BSN.
Henceforth he took over "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator," Reyes said.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had directed here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me: "I have a strong 6" 7" player.
Do you want it?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended sniper Raymond Gausse, who was nativeized and was one of our best shooters.
I remember he said if Mincy had given Bayamon a championship, Gausse would help bring another one.
The Vacceros Championship with Gausse enjoyed it, but already far away, since by 1988 it was already a federal mandamas.
For that time I preferred to enjoy their executions and those of Mincy on the National Team.
I remember when we first beat the United States during the 1989 pre-lympic in Mexico.
Then came the 1990 World Cup where we arrived fourth place and must have been bronzed not by that Canadian referee who made us repeat the final move for the second time, Kinges said.
Is that group of the 1990 World Cup the best National Team you've ever seen?
It's one of the best, just like the one that won Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was that of the Pan Americans in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and we gave it to the U.S. team, which was quite similar to what bronze earned us in the world.
That team not only repeated Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico Lopez and "Piculin" (Ortiz), but also had (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter young, the Leon brothers (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to be in the 90s due to an injury on the knee.
A team that may not have been the best in terms of staff, but gave us a gold medal and a great joy was that of the 1995 Preolimpic in Neuquén, Argentina.
With role players such as "Canito" Snows, Pablo Alicea and a youth Rolando Hourruitiner in place of the players suspended by the Pan American Silver Sea, we earn gold against all predictions.
What was Puerto Rico's best player?
Without a doubt, that was Piculín Ortiz.
Its numbers at the international tournament level are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at that level as Piculin did.
And that doesn't count his career in the different leagues he played.
Who's been the best borician leader?
That's very difficult.
We have had a very good layer including Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Young people, I really like Leo Arill's work.
What do you consider your greatest achievement in the federation?
It had been part of the most glorious era of the National Team between 1988 and 1995 and that at the beginning of the 90s the BSN had up to 17 teams in one season.
What did you have to do?
There were things I wanted to implement, such as regionalization of the minor categories.
For example, that Ponce boys only play in their area and face only teams from other corners of the Island in national playoffs.
Right now children travel and play too much unnecessarily.
At least I see the fruit of compulsory certifications and course for leaders, table officers and referees.
That pleases me.
What are you doing now?
What I do most is listen to music, watch music videos from my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games.
And of course, enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me.
actor Larry Hagman dies
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, became world famous for his central role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R"., in the television series "Dallas", in which he embodied a businessman without scruples, malicious and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil predator J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died on Friday afternoon due to complications of cancer, according to a family statement provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer house of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in her beloved hometown of Dallas, representing again the iconic role she liked most," the family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played the role of her wife in the original series and in the sequel, was with Hagman when she died in a Dallas hospital, said her publisher, Jeffrey Lane.
It brought joy to everyone I knew.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived his life to the fullest," Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and recognized that he had been drinking a lot for years.
In 1995, he was found with a malignant tumor in his liver and underwent a transplant.
Years before "Dallas", Hagman became famous on television as a decent guy in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie", broadcast by the NBC chain from 1965 to 1970.
She played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is altered when she finds an attractive genius, played by Barbara Eden, and takes her to live with him at home.
He was also the protagonist of two comedies that spent little time in the air, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His work in cinema included well-received papers from the "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful interpretation of the charmingly detestable J.R. that led Hagman to his greatest star.
The CBS series on the Ewing clan and other characters in its orbit was aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional phrase "Who shot J.R.?", designed to generate expectation around an episode full of emotions in which the character of Hagman is almost killed, generated an international speculation and millions of dollars risked in betting houses.
It also helped give the series a record of hearings at that time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 chapter, an average of 41 million viewers tuned it and turned "Dallas" into the second most visible entertainment program in history, behind the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was the sister-in-law of J.R., Kristin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. pregnant her and then threatened to make her a prostitute unless she left town, but others also had reason to attack her.
Hagman interpreted Ewing as an insatiable corrupt with a charismatic smile: a cheating businessman and an unfaithful husband who tried to get his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), admitted.
"I know what I want on J.R.'s tombstone," Hagman said in 1988.
I should say, "Here lies the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only deal you lost.
Victoria Principal, co-protagonist of the original series, recalled on Friday Hagman as someone "great, inside and out of the screen".
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of admirers in the world, and in the hearts of each one of us, that we were lucky to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success for the TNT channel.
It had already finished recording five of the chapters for the second season and a sixth was in process, reported the chain.
Immediately there was no statement by Warner or TNT on how the Hagman loss series will handle.
Oriondo de Fort Worth, Texas, was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who stelarized classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when he had him in 1931 during his marriage to counsel Ben Hagman.
He was lucky at the New York theatre scene in the early 1950s, and then served in the 1952 to 1956 Air Force in England.
While there she met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two sons, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001 he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't put anything there that I thought would hurt someone or affect them somehow," he said to Associated Press at that time.
After the liver transplant, he became organ donor promoter and worked as a volunteer at a hospital to assist the dreaded patients.
"I advise them, I give them courage, I gather with them when they come for their surgery, and then," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to offer some comfort, like "don't worry, it'll be a little uncomfortable for a short time, but they'll be fine."
He was also an activist against the smoking habit and participated in several campaigns.
They begin a course that explores the "End of the World"
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when the Stuart Charmé religion teacher decided to take a course on the end of the world, he knew he had an irresistible hook: The end of the "long countdown" of the Maya Calendar, on December 21, to which many people have clinged as proof that the end of the world is coming.
But Charmé had no idea what he expected in the following couple of months: Hurricane Hurricane Sandy, a fiscal precipice that some have called "dedarmagedon" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christian theorists of the end of the times believe that the Apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize that this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester there has been," Charmé said this week to students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey).
If you analyze what has been happening in the world today as if we were 30 days away and counting, this has been a really good period.
And remember that bad is good for those of apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only teacher who offers courses on the "end of the world" this semester, in theory the last of history.
In Temple, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker is teaching the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas proliferate over time," he said, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that guide certain human behavior.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could explode.
This month the students analyzed movies with apocalyptic themes and explored how they compare with real life examples.
"I have tried to inform students about what is possible, probable, credible and impossible," Vacker said.
On the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, the Professor of History of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an Associate Professor of Art History and Anthropology, have made teams to teach a course, entitled only "The End of the World".
"We don't add '2012' to always have the option to teach the course again, in case the world doesn't end," said Restall.
Despite the "near ruin", students must study, generate projects and take final exams.
In Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, which leaves students no choice but to work "until the very night the world is supposed to end," said Restall.
The courses were quite popular.
"It was saturated in two hours," Restall said about his course for high-average students, who filled up with 35 students.
We received e-mail messages for weeks and weeks before the start of the semester, from people who asked if there was still any place.
Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It is fascinating to see what people are doing to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old career student in Haddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers-Camden.
And it is that apocalyptic mentality, secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort or the absence of it.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old psychology and nursing student, said he saw all the apocalyptic films.
"I had never heard of a class that could teach that," he said.
I enjoy it.
But no student interviewed - and much less a teacher - said he believed in the expiry date of December 21.
"Our first project dealt with Mayan prophecy and we somehow discredit it," said Julie Zeglen, a senior student in Temple, 21 and West Chester.
The Maya never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key point on the calendar," said Restall.
But it claimed that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, dating back to several centuries, in which people react to the changes around them predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused an increase in these speculations.
"On other sides people don't think about this," he said.
Mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who teaches in the Philippines this year, quickly responded to the question of whether he knew about any course on the "end of the world" there.
"The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world," he wrote, insinuating an exception of a superior authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall noted that over the years many days of the final trial have been spoken, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will start thinking immediately on the next date" or to philosophy that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world will end.
Students and teachers are taking the day lightly.
Several said they're planning to go to "end of the world" parties.
"Maybe call some friends to laugh together," said 20-year-old Samira Ford, a communications student.
