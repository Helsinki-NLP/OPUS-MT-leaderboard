Parliament has not ratified the amendment for the release of Tymosenko
The Ukrainian parliament refused, as part of an amendment to criminal law, the draft annulment of the paragraph on the indictment of Julia Tymosenko, the leader of the opposition.
The second reading of the draft amendment aimed at reducing penalties for economic crimes, which could have opened the doors of freedom for the former Prime Minister currently imprisoned.
Tymosenko was sentenced to 7 years in prison in October for entering into an earlier disadvantageous agreement with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not final and the court must rule on the appeal of the convicted person in December.
Tymosenko qualifies the regime's political revenge judgement and has provoked a process of biased suspicions from the court to the west as well.
The draft annulling paragraph 365 of criminal law, on which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was signed by 147 MPs.
It would have taken 226 votes to approve it.
Libyan Victory
Libyan liberation or rebellion has already won.
Muammar Kaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
The winners are still to be determined.
As is customary in the region, the winners in the elections are Islamists, but they are moderate or radical.
The Provisional National Council has decreed the usual law of the Sharia and we already know what it is.
Libya becomes a country without crime because for a flight, we cut hands.
Women may forget emancipation, the potential non-respectors of faith are liable to death penalty...
It is the Koran who will unite instead of the dictator's personality the society composed of opposing tribes.
In Libya we will rule such an order as we cannot represent it and as we certainly would not like it.
But our way of life is not unique, it is not objectively the best and probably not advantageous for Libyans.
It is particularly surprising that Islamic warriors have accepted aid with the recognition of the unfaithful dogs.
The only excuse is that it was not an American general who was leading the attacks of NATO but rather Allah whom they celebrated the greatness of each attack.
When it comes to seeking the winners in Libya, the West is not part of it.
We took part in the shootings, served Islam and our policies turned away from the dictator as a political ally without bringing any profit.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not occupy Libya militarily.
Therefore, there is no problem for the premises to get rid of "crossed".
Without land use, oil companies will have easy access to Libyan black gold.
Perhaps not so much and the West will finally be able to boast of self-interested protection of human rights.
For as long as we prevent these sharia followers from doing so.
A new era of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe are in investors' sight.
A tornado of statistics has passed on Tuesday on Europe.
Each of the states published the GDP-related information for the 3A.
The Czech economy has stagnated this last quarter, while France and Germany are growing.
The bond market beats all the records.
Investors not only look at Italy, but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the euro area, Germany, Czech Republic and other countries of Europe published their views on economic development earlier in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP is expected to grow by 0.5%, France's by 0.4%.
The two countries modified the data for the second quarter in which Germany was better placed than expected (increasing 0.3% instead of 0.1% expected), but France reported a slight decrease of 0.1% (at the origin of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter.
But GDP has stagnated and according to the Czech Statistical Office it is confirmed that we are heading towards a gradual reduction in economic growth.
The results are worse than the analysts' forecasts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% during the third quarter but stagnated during the last quarter.
In the third quarter, the German economy grew by 0.5% according to the expected and periodically recalculated data.
The economy of the euro area and the European Union grew by 0.2% between July and September compared to the previous quarter, corresponding to what analysts had foreseen.
The Greek economy has fallen by 5.2%.
The 10-year bond yield is 28.45%
The performance of the obligations of Spain and Italy is increasing towards critical limits.
The problems are starting to feel in Austria, France, Belgium, etc.
The yields of Czech bonds remain below 4% while the situation worsens in the region.
In Germany , votes were heard to say that the ECB should be the last instance guarantee .
The Czechs qualified for the EURO.
They won in Montenegro 1:0 and celebrated the qualification for 200 million
The performance of football has succeeded in its most difficult mission of the season!
In Montenegro, she also won thanks to Super Cech and Guardian Petr Jiracek 1:0.
Czech football has been very expensive to defend with a great deal of luck in the second part of its qualification and will not miss the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the qualifying game with detailed reporting.
No particular excitement during the first part and a great deal of luck for the second part.
The Czech performance also won thanks to the Super Cech and the hero Petr Jiracek with 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates his qualification at the European Championship.
Montenegrains were under pressure up to Part II due to specific Czech defence.
The vices of the game were Damjanovic and Vuccinic who missed two chances to score a goal.
And thanks to the super Petr Cech Czech representation will not be absent at the European Championship next year, and in addition a reward of 200 million crowns in the Czech Football Fund.
In the first few minutes we played a warrior football.
Both teams had difficulty mounting combinations and the game concentrated mainly around the central line.
The pressure of national footballers has not been able to penetrate the Czech defence, which has accurately responded to the long shots even during the first half-time.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear program.
They created a human shield
A few hundred high school students have created a human shield around a nuclear site in Iran.
They want to support their country's nuclear programme through this gesture in the face of a possible Israeli assault.
The students began to pray at noon in front of the site and then wished for the death of the EU and Israel.
A few hundred students from Ispahan universities have created a human shield on Tuesday around the Ispahan Nuclear Technology Centre where uranium is transformed.
They thus openly expressed their support for their country's nuclear programme at the risk of their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) noted in its latest information that Iran has continued to strengthen its nuclear weaponry.
In Israel, a possible attack by Iranian nuclear institutions is reported.
The students began to pray at noon in front of the site and then wished for the death of the EU and Israel.
In the case of an attack, whose objective would be to destroy the Iranian nuclear programme, targets would not only be Ispahan, but also the Natanz site where uranium is enriched.
The feeding of an obese child: don't eat breakfast and take charcuterie for dinner
Over one third of children aged 9 to 13 have overweight problems, 9% of schoolchildren will be overweight and 5% will be obese.
As current research shows, obese children come from families with a unhealthy lifestyle.
This shows again how important is the environment in which the human being evolves and the models surrounding him.
For example, 50% more often than in normal-weighted children's families are found on obese children's tables.
19% of the obese had fries at dinner according to the investigation carried out with an awareness action " Obesity is not a coincidence"
In the families of small adults sport is also not a habit, which is now the case of most schoolchildren today - only 15% answered that at least once a week the parents found time for active movement.
Survey of 900 children
The survey took place during the last school year and participated in 900 primary schools in Czech Republic.
It was the second edition of " Obesity is not a coincidence", action supported by the General Health Insurance and Unilever society.
Since the beginning, more than 12000 sixth to third students have enrolled in this project.
One of the determining factors that cause a dramatic increase in the number of overweight, or even obese children, is the absence, correct diet and not enough physical exercise.
"Only half of the children questioned indicate, for example, eating 5 times a day breakfast in case - lunch - taste- dinner, which is a basic principle of good food," indicates one of the results of the survey.
No breakfast and charcuterie at dinner
Specialists draw attention to the fact that to have healthy development we need some basic details such as a family breakfast at the same time.
In Czech, only 23% of the pupils' families eat at the same time.
In most families everyone has breakfast alone.
And the worst thing that's been noticed is that a tenth of the population doesn't have breakfast at all.
Breakfast is, however, the basis of a good daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that obese children's families consume unhealthy fries more often.
Almost every student - not to mention weight - drinks daily (70%).
More than 40% of the children questioned do sports regularly but for parents it is half, only 15%.
Prepare your food
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to prepare their own food based on opportunities offered according to their own taste and personal opinion.
"The preferences of Czech children between 12 and 15 years of age are far from ideal for healthy eating."
Among their favorite dishes are many cakes, meats and sugars.
"The most alarming is, in particular, a great preference for sweet lemonades," is indicated in the results of the investigation.
For lunch are the pasta that took first place right in front of the white meat.
Children did not want to be fertile at all, and the preference for fish and vegetable meals was very low.
Head of Health
The survey also showed that children are ready to change their habits from the time they receive ad hoc information.
"In the course of a review of a group of survey participants who had completed the questionnaire after the awareness session " Obesity is not a coincidence," we saw a strong desire to move towards healthy food," the results of the survey indicate.
For example, the most striking was for sweet lemonades because children began to give preference to drinking water.
Children most often checked the questionnaire for white meat and fish as main dish and would reduce sweet dishes and "knedliky" (Czech speciality of bread flour or potatoes).
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, say the professionals
In a presentation article on how to learn for the stylists, I became somewhat angry that there was a lot of them from the beginning.
I didn't think about what would happen next.
The presentations of three professionals of the specialty, the dress of the characters and a seminar on what is happening on the spot.
And it'll be worse.
The closer we get to final reviews and the more we expect practical exercises and information.
And even when there are courses on Saturdays and Sundays it's really "studded."
This time we have with Director Alenka (there is no boy in the course) treated the way to dress the woman who has no standard measurements.
And women of this kind are the majority.
One has a small neck, the other one body of a boy, without a particular curve, another one of the superweights.
The stylist should know how to optically reduce large arms, lengthen a neck or add necessary curves.
We have thus come to highlight the character beautifully and also not dress too clearly of the types of women like Jennifer Lopez with a strong chest and pronounced hips and fine size.
If, for example, there is a difference between the size and hips in such a way that skirts or pants do not pass at all, that is worth the effort.
And you will not regret it because the garment that falls impeccably is priceless.
In a custom skirt you will feel much better than in the one that slips permanently, rolls and does not hold the belt and so on.
For those who have a male appearance can afford a Tucker style dress, with pieces of sewn fabric, or even embroidery.
There are, of course, many examples of diverse appearances and I am glad that I have all week to sort out all the information received.
But I'm also afraid that because of what I have to do at home there is too much.
Each trainee received a celebrity to dress for the day and the evening.
We must take into account the current appearance, the type of personality mode and its appearance.
I'll have to "dress" Miranda Kerr, that maybe you know Victoria's Secret from the campaign.
Deep down, I like it, because it's better than dressing Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera who has taken almost 100 kilos lately (don't take my statement, svp, completely seriously) or young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut and sew from magazines or search the Internet, print and work graphics.
The Moodleboard, as it is said for the final result, expresses our personal style as well as our relationship with graphic creation.
Reflecting on the graphic part of the styling is also important.
The stylist not only wears physics but creates, for example, productive pages in magazines (on given products trends for handbags, coats, etc...).
Mario Kamenik, a stylist and a graphic designer, has provided us with all this.
But that... until Sunday.
The stylist must have a general vision
Three guests of the specialty gave a diverse appearance at the Saturday session filled with information about the different types of characters.
Honza Pokorny, stylist, Jakub Polanka fashion graphic designer and Ben Renc, fashion photographer.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to use it.
And a talented stylist knows how to work with one outfit differently.
For this example, variability is paramount.
Like for example this t-shirt that must be worn in a classic way with a jeans and a t-shirt like a light coat but also it can also dress the naked body, with scarves and take it as a dress.
Or just pull up the sleeves or collar and immediately have a new look.
"Play with this," he said.
But I particularly appreciated the following advice: "For work you need to know the rules perfectly".
"You can then start to contravene it," Jakub said.
Finally I understand why we try to learn these rules, what to do with, why, while in fashion magazines we sometimes see something else.
No statement on fashion parades.
I know again, thanks to the fashion photographer Ben that the designer must have much more variants of clothing than those that are photographed.
That is to say, for fashion story that will have about ten pages (then about ten models) I must be ready to "cut" at least fifteen.
And also, a garment and its combination with other elements appear completely different than in reality.
We must rely on this when creating a model.
The fact that the image and style sometimes make half of the success has been confirmed by Honza Pokorny.
Just look at Madonna who is not a super singer, but her image and marketing have made her a world star.
In Czech Republic, the approach to the use of the services of the stylists remains still chilly.
And the known faces sometimes consider them useless (it is enough that I know something but what I seem to pass to the second rank).
And if someone gets styling on our part, then we have to rely on the fact that he dictates to us with a great probability a completely different size (smaller) than he actually has.
Then we only have to navigate on google and make sure if the news of boulevard tells of the celebrity in question, if it has skinny or thick etc...
Honza and Mario put us on Sunday on the heart that it is not enough for the stylist to focus on fashion and know how to assemble models.
He must communicate with the people he wears and so it is important to be a good psychologist.
Knowing how to guess people, not brag, keep their opinion.
"When a manager asks you to sort out his closet and fill it with new elements you can't throw everything away and tell him, My God what a horror."
"You'll find some business you'll find pretty and he'll advise you on what to wear them with," Mario says.
This one actually showed us what everything must contain what is called the "placovka" or bag of the stylist.
It's the one you hang around the size and you have on yourself for everything you need.
In addition to things clearly defined as scissors, depilation rollers, or baby pins, there is also nylon thread (which the stylist uses to photograph products such as bags, or hats), special clips with which one closes a garment in the back, if it is too large (the blade or other type of staple are not usable because they could damage the garment) or a sewing kit.
So that we were not just people who listen but who tried something in a practical way they taught us how to properly resemble shoes.
And during the photo session in the workshop where the surface is equal, the sole could be damaged, outside fortiori.
And so we glued and glued.
We did not have the right to touch the scissors so as not to be inadvertently injured.
Therefore, there is a real need for skills.
Mario was pleased when he congratulated me on my creation.
The story I'm telling you about isn't about my girlfriend.
This is just a small summary of what we learned during the second course weekend
I am becoming increasingly aware that making styling a profession is not a walk in a rose garden, let everyone tell what he wants.
The need for speed The Run fights across America.
By Way of Review
Originally, a race without problems is transformed by a set of stupid mistakes of people who have nothing to do with a routine morning shift at work.
This fills up to a certain extent the ambition of each but it is of no use if no one wants to do anything more.
The new part entitled The Run produced great expectations before its release.
He promised to take a new direction with the already old Need for Speed race series and to get out of some sort of game from the playable parts that would not just count on points.
So we were curious how the passages added during which the main hero came out of his car and did what he wanted.
As already in the NFS series, the result is completely different from what was expected.
They are potentially arcade racing games but the whole pulls down because of some unnecessary mistakes that have already existed for several years.
These are not really errors but rather the expression of an incomprehensible fannery on the part of the developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You are caught up in the adventure of which the main hero Jack has character problems and in order to solve them he gets to participate in illegal races across America.
You are sitting behind the wheel on the west coast of San Francisco and your mission is to arrive first in New York.
The idea has interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages and then into more than 50 races.
The result is that each race takes place on another route and the stages envisaged in different environments that distinguish each other quite well and are interesting.
The player does not have the feeling that the game offers him something identical.
Some environments are rather beautiful even though the graphic technical level is the same as the previous series.
It's not the end of the world.
But driving through the desert, in autumn landscapes or in highly snowy mountains is very pleasant visually.
The tests are more time-consuming with an atypical element.
For example in the desert you find yourself in a sandstorm that significantly reduces your visibility.
Then in the mountains you must be careful that an avalanche does not fall upon you.
Next to this the different races are well arranged behind each other.
There are only a small number of them, but that's enough.
There are moments you try to exceed the requested number of opponents (like in a classic race) then run against the watch (classic duel with the timer) and then wait for another duel with an opponent.
From time to time you also have the police that enter the game and try to make your situation difficult.
The novelty is the out-of-vehicle passages.
It's rather an interactive animation when most of the time Jack runs away from someone and you need to help him by taping the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
What is surprising is that there are fewer times like this than you expect (to be concrete there are only three).
The result is as well because this element is not likely to interfere and places itself, in the context described above, in the elements that enhance the game.
The driving model is in the tradition of previous games.
Which means that at present there is nothing extraordinary but it cannot be said to be negative.
With regard to realistic simulation you will have to go and see elsewhere.
But although we can better find in the competition the driving model goes very well with the type of race design.
So everything's okay.
Problems begin to appear after some time.
Unlike the driving model, collisions have not yet been completed.
We do not expect a complicated deformation and collisions from this game, but when you do not have, during a collision with any object, the slightest idea of how your car behaves, it is therefore not completely good.
During tight overruns you sometimes touch each other slightly but otherwise your car goes into crazy rusts.
Or it's in socks.
Thanks to the restart system this is not really a problem but it really bothers you.
The restart is done in such a way that when you have broken your face or you have gone out into the game decor brings you back at the time of the last point on the itinerary.
But you only have 5 restarts.
When you have used the 5 restarts you have to restart the game from the beginning.
So it's more a tool, in case something doesn't happen as it should, than something you can really count on.
Sometimes restarts do not help and you need to find the solution by remembering the part of the route in question.
The big hic of this game is that the same actions are found in the same places.
For example, there are some turns that need to be done in a certain way, otherwise it does not happen.
Otherwise you meet in a given place "civil vehicles" always in the same configuration as you arrived first, fifth, 5 seconds in advance or a minute late.
What makes you angry are the situations when you easily pass the opponent between two cars coming backwards and when you get there, you need either to stand aside and turn around or to slow them down.
It's equal if you go ahead of him because it's "calculated" so that for the given situation it always happens close to your nose.
Opponents still have other advantages.
All the time of the game, you arrive in some places, again without worrying about the time, and you still have the same opponent that precedes you in the same place.
This gets the most annoying at the end of the game when you ride on a long bridge in the opposite direction.
The opponent must at any cost pass before you.
When it passes before you it hides the sight of other vehicles in reverse and you collide a lot of times.
You can understand that the purpose of this game is to do something captivating and full of adrenaline, but it is clear that you are bored quickly.
And it's bad because through a simple driving model the game is interesting and places with so much action that you don't have time to follow everything that happens.
And it's equal if it's because of the concept of 50 unique routes, that the order of the races is such that there's no chance of getting bored or anything else.
The original idea is the car change during the races.
You need to be careful about petrol pumps on the routes because you can change cars however most of the time the one you have enough.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are ideal for cities, large U.S. bicycles for straight highways and super sports cars at exotic sights on very technical pipelines, for example on lace roads in the mountains.
And the way of challenges, which are races in particular places you know about adventure, goes very well with the main regime of history.
You receive not only medals but also points of experience that add to your profile that are common to challenges and adventure.
When you have reached the highest level of driver, different objects begin to unwind:
This one connects online with the Autolog function that compares your results with those of other players and provides you with other functions in the community.
One of the most difficult shots to understand is the situation of the last race of adventure.
You arrive with your car in the subway tunnel (like this) where you ride in the darkness on the tracks (like this).
Your speed indicator tells you between 150 and 200 km/h (a priori) and behind you comes a subway branch that sends the car directly to the hardware.
At the writing we had a discussion for a few days whether someone really thought about the creation of this game or whether the authors really think of us as idiots.
The technical part of the game is not extra, but the visual part is generally pleasant and in some cases really great.
What's bothering is that in more extreme situations, imaging does not hold the level and in some cases tragically.
This mainly concerns accidents with a large number of participants when a fluid imaging is no longer useful to you.
The sound part is good and the track is in choice.
In order to please the greatest number and especially the young public a new soundtrack has been created in the "I mix everything" style, but one can expect that no one will buy the game for music.
General impression of Need for Speed: The Run is therefore really confused.
If the game did not have these stupid mistakes we could say without fear that it is the best production of NFS in recent years.
But this game gives the impression that it's not over.
The fun is really good but prepare yourself to have the faults hit your eyes with the strength of an aerodrome reflector.
The Velvet Students in concert with the choirs of Charles University
The Festival Fiesta Academica offers for the third time festivals that connect the International Student Day with the anniversary of the Velor Revolution with a musical part.
During the festival there are 20 choirs of high schools and secondary classes.
The festival was set up in two concerts organized on 17 November.
"Charles University has an important part in this festival."
"Of the choirs there is the Choeur of the Faculty of Pedagogy and Humanities, on the festival committee sits the rector Vaclav Hampl," says the leader of the organizing team Jakub Calou.
The highlight of the festival is the Choeur des lycées and secondary classes concert that takes place with free entrance on November 17 from 14 hours on the space located in front of the National Technical Library in Dejvice.
In the program there is the composition of the well-known Czech jazzman Karel Ruzicka, Celebration Jazz mass.
In the evening the concert "Speed Students" takes place in the premises of the National House in Vinohrady during which the choirs of the higher schools as well as that of Charles University are produced.
The aim of the Festival Academica is not only to celebrate the International Day of Students with dignity and recall the 22nd anniversary of the velour revolution, but also to present to the public a choir music of the highest level and to develop creative cooperation of young people.
The main organizer is the Union of Czech Fathers in cooperation with the Jan Kepler High School.
All the action is placed under the aegis of Bohuslav Svoboda, Mayor of Prague and Vaclav Hampl, Rector of Charles University.
The festival takes place from 16 to 20 November in Prague and Pardubice.
The program also offers high-level concerts, Mexican meetings, student chatting and other activities.
The interested parties will find all the information on the Internet pages of the festival www.festaacademica.cz.
Vicenova, Ambassador to the European Union:
Czechs behave like negativists and Eurosceptics
"The Lisbon Treaty has radically abolished the balance between the institutions"
"I wasn't expecting such a tough war."
"This will last 5.6 years before the situation calms down and all players get used to their new role," as Miléna Vicenova began her presentation to the Faculty of Law the Czech ambassador to the European Union.
When she managed to describe the various EU bodies and their relations in such a comprehensible and visible way, to the point that a large number of lecturers from Charles University Law School could send her, she showed how much she takes her motto "understandable and openly about Europe" very seriously.
Mrs Vicenova paid tribute to the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new permanent President of the European Council.
"From the beginning they echoed the criticisms that he is fad, that it is a round of leather, that he cannot fulfill any mission and I must say that he has cut off everyone's breath because he plays his role in perfection."
"He is a man who can listen to 27 member states, communicate well with them and has a clear vision of the direction to take from Europe."
She explained the new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Defence Policy as part of an answer to the question: "Who is in the European Union?" "What phone number should I call?", so as an important step towards unity and greater readability of Union policy vis-à-vis the states, such as China or India.
No one wants to ban us our Syrecky (cooked pasta cheese that feels very strong)
Mrs Vicenova also mentioned the agenda that she has lived, lived, and will live in a very near time for the European Council.
She qualified the Czech Presidency two years ago for success.
The Czechs resolved the financial crisis, the gas crisis or organized a Summit for an Eastern Partnership.
It described the fall of the government as very negative and damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
According to the words of Mrs. Ambassador, "the activity has fought its full" not only for the Presidency but also for the financial crisis that continues to resolve itself now.
In addition, we need to approve the Union's new septimal budget, which is becoming very complicated because of the current economic situation.
As the budget would appear to be thin and cost-effective, what kind of priority will be given, which countries will be most helped, at least everything is to be resolved in the future negotiations.
Mrs. Ambassador recalled her slogans with which she arrived in Brussels "For a Europe that is understandable".
"I really don't like abbreviations, foreign words, jargons that no one understands.
As the citizen must understand, it is true that in Brussels no one makes round or twisted cornices, bananas differently large or nobody has forbidden us to make Syrecky".
It wants to make better use of the EU's environment and see more Czechs in the European institutions.
A Europe at various speeds awaits us
According to the Ambassador the Czechs have the reputation of being Eurosceptics and people who see things only in their negative rather than positively.
She is also sorry to see such a small Czech representation in the European institutions.
The fault, according to her, results from several factors, such as the shyness of our candidates, their inability to write a letter of motivation and low support from the Czech side.
In addition to a successful Czech presidency, she then stressed the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad group.
"Believe me, when the Polish, the Magyar, the Slovak come to me, this French man says to me: 'Hey, what are you doing there, what is this group of Visegrad still doing?" and he is not at all happy."
According to Mrs Vicenova, in the near future, there are tough new budgetary policy rules for member countries.
It is the concept of a two-speed Europe, if not at multiple speeds, that boasts rather than a "new European Federation".
"We have countries in the euro area and others out of the area."
"We have the Schengen area, we also have the institution for enhanced cooperation."
First he was said to cooperate between them the countries that want him and those who do not want him remain in their corner."
"There will be many such institutes and there will be a truly two-speed Europe," Mrs Vicenova expected.
From this point of view, she also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye to determine the basis that all themes having an impact on the EU should be discussed among all EU members and not just the members of the eurozone.
History of a brand:
IBM innovator begins the second century of its existence
If anyone were to look for the word that expresses the IBM strategy as closely as possible, the closest one would be "the long term".
For a wide audience IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, it is a firm felt as very current and yet since its creation it has been 100 years.
The basis of this long-term strategy was laid by the first head of the firm, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He left this slogan that a large number of global problems can be solved for little if people are willing to think.
His slogan "PENSE" has become the footprint around which the life of a future giant will develop (and also the title of the internal magazine IBM began to edit in 1935).
It was the basis of the culture of the carefully developed company by Watson.
For us IBM means a long-term thought of continuous forward-looking movements.
IBM survived a hundred years due to the fact that it remained faithful to its basic values and yet was not afraid to change all the others around it.
This allowed us in the first century to transform technology, business and society.
We hope that in the second century we will achieve even more" has released for the anniversary the current director of Samuel J. Palmisano.
A well-prepared system
Watson, in the 1930s, took care of his employees as Bata in the Czech Republic - IBM people were the only ones among the first U.S. employees to have paid vacations, an insurance paid by the employer plus an elegant employee uniform and a well-designed system of rewards for inventors and traders.
Similarly IBM has a well-developed customer relationship system.
The society was at the very beginning in the discovery of talents—as one of the first firms to have abolished any form of discrimination and thus could have the choice.
The current plan is entirely in the spirit of the anti-discrimination strategy as it will be a woman- Virginia Rometty - who should replace Palmisano with the head of IBM.
She has been working with IBM for 30 years and is currently serving as Chief of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
IBM over the past few years has done what is known as jamy, brainstorming online, from which many future strategies and innovations have emerged.
It is not surprising that there are many ideas - in the firm there are nearly 500,000 people who work.
An institution with a good name
It is the internal and external image of the company that gives it a secure position in the business field.
"Since the beginning IBM had a concept rather than a technological firm," said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Economic Professor at Harvard Economics School and author of the book on IBM.
"IVM is not a tech firm but a firm that helps solve business problems using its technology," said Geogre Colony from Consulting Forrester Research.
As the firm itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and creating this market.
IBM - or the "Great Blue", as it is familiarly called the United States in view of its slogan - in a hundred years it grew up to become one of the largest firms in the world.
It is, of course, the most versatile technological firm - it develops software, hardware, infrastructure, accommodation, consulting services in server products to nanotechnology.
It has many patents from all American technological firms and five of its employees received a Nobel prize.
Among its discoveries are the ticket distributor, the payment card, the financial swap, the bar code or the diskette.
IBM found itself this year with $220 billion the second largest technology firm according to market capitalization (the first is Apple), when for the first time it exceeded Microsoft in 1996.
Preview in advance
Not all innovations and manufactures have had the preference of the client and the time - IBM for example failed to bet on a OS/2 own operating system, the Online Prodige service or the PCjr IBM computer:
"From the moment your business is built on the movement ahead you can't emotionally stay stuck on the past," noted Samuel J. Palmisano.
For this IBM has no problem building its bases on many platforms and when they don't work it goes away.
Unlike, for example, the Microsoft competitor who stands at the base and remains under the Windows operating system.
Prospective technology
In IBM revenues, services, which are formed for a fifth by software and hardware, have a prominent place.
However, in 1990 she was with more than the strongest hardware representative.
Starting in 2000, IBM sold low-performance assets for $15 billion, during which period it invested $58 billion in the purchase of technology perspectives.
It continues in investments and even since 2008 when for the first time it has exceeded the new financial crisis .
IBM negotiates according to the precepts of its first leader Thomas J. Watson, who also increased its investment volume during the great economic crisis.
Now it appeared that IBM is going through the current crisis without being worried?
The IBM share price has increased from 2008 as a merger of 120 percent, the net profit of the firm continues to grow.
The IBM logo is to change everything but not its values.
This can be expected if this flexible giant controls other crises.
History of IBM: From cheese slices to flights in the cosmos.
IBM (International Business Machines) was born in New York a hundred years ago, originally known as Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It took the name IBM in 1924 - initially it was a brand used by a branch of a firm in Canada and South America.
The basis of the future IBM was the fusion of four firms whose history is linked to the year 80 of the nineteenth century.
They had technologies such as old "pointers", pendulums that recorded the arrival and departure of employees.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 presided over the Board of Surveillance of the company.
Flint hired the head of a competing firm Thomas J. Watson to help him lead the company.
The leader then cast the shadow on the founder of the firm - it is on Watson's ideas that so far rest the identity and culture of society.
Watson led the Kusqu' firm in 1952.
IBM, as its name says, began with the production of all possible machinery for business and trade - from cheese and meat slicers to register boxes.
During the first four years of Watson's leadership, turnover increased to $9 million and began to expand the firm in all parts of the world.
Watson was for the firm so irreplaceable that after 40 years of management it was his son who held the chair of director Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his direction IBM began the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s people and computers at IBM helped NASA guide flights into the cosmos - on Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the flight on the Moon.
In the meantime in 1964 IBM developed the first family of computers - the IBM System/360.
The classic PC that determines the computer standard of the time with the name of IBM 5150 arrived on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later IBM sold its computer manufacturing to the Chinese company Lenovo, but purchased Consulting Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to deal with advice and services with high added value.
The strategy that has succeeded in IBM over the past three years - is the Smarter Planet concept "a smarter planet".
Its objective is the intelligent use of technology in areas not yet exploited, such as transport and management of cities.
With regard to IBM's trade area, a "Smarter Commerce" platform recently developed that helps businesses manage the entire business cycle.
IBM also has a strong history on our territory.
She created her branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932, then the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM RT, there is also Brno's strategic outsourcing centre.
The Central European Central and Eastern Europe Centre is located in Prague and there is also the global research and development team dealing with the recognition of speech.
Rychtarova about her unfaithful husband:
Ivette you can keep that ass, I don't want any more!
Darina Rychtarova (53 years old) said it's over!
After her husband Joseph Rychtar (53 years old) became a bodyguard and a lover of Iveta Bartosova (45 years old), Darina was still hoping that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and return home.
Only it could not wait and set clear rules for future life.
"Pepa can come home, but not like my partner," Rychtarova explained.
When Darina Rychtarova gave asylum in summer in Bartosova in her house, she did not doubt that her couple would not hold.
When Iveta after 30 days insisted on moving from Ricany, Pepa did not reject the singer.
And he confessed in public that he loved him.
In time Darina resigned, accepted her husband's connection and ended up saying goodbye to her forever.
Rychtirova is not interested in knowing who her husband is sleeping with.
If Rychtar and Bartosova separate there will be no wife to welcome her on the steps of the door of the house.
"He is my son's biological father and if he wants to finish his life in our common house, no one will put him out."
"He will no longer be my beloved and lost old ass, but a man with whom I have a special relationship," he let Rychtarova filter by showing that she has left her husband but that they only remain in a decent relationship.
The fact that Darina closed the door to him is not a problem for Joseph.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I will stay with Iveta and not change."
"My wife set up a marriage on paper and I respect it."
"Society continues, I take care of repairs, garden, real estate, I buy."
"With Darina we discuss completely normal but we don't sleep together," Rychtar said for Blesk.
If Rychtarova finds a new love he won't stop it.
"We don't sleep together and I don't care where she goes, with whom and if she has a connection.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with "Iveta and I take full responsibility," Joseph concluded.
The worst vices of women: Does this apply to you as well?
If you ask men to determine women's typical vices, all of them, like each other, are able to get them out of their sleeves.
My dear ladies, you will know in the following lines of the female vices who are able to pump the blood of men's veins.
Procurement
Does your half comment you are dependent on purchases?
Should you buy at least one garment a week?
Are you happy to buy and by packages at the time of the balances?
In your case we can talk about purchases as a vice.
Some women believe that they should restrict their passion for purchasing.
But you will say, which would resist the window-leather of clothing stores, to seek for yourself beautiful clothes and then try them all in cabin (ideal of different colors)?
And although for most women to buy is a hobby, it can become for men a real hell.
Just remember how many times have you told your spouse that he's waiting at the entrance...
Insatisfaction constant
"I'm not too big"?
"I would need to thin out at least 5 kilos - should I start doing sports?"
"Do you like me?"
Don't these phrases remind you of anything?
Yeah?
So you are one of those women who are obsessed with their appearance.
It is not the question that you should stop dealing with yourself, but a large number of men are allergic to the fact that their partner is still complaining about his appearance.
Strong sex does not hesitate to say that the frequency of these complaints increases and that women become poisonous.
The smell and cleanliness in the first place
It's like an infinite manage.
Wash the windows, pass the vacuum cleaner, clean the soil, make the dust, peel the bathroom - and this twice a week.
Do you make remarks to your partner that he walks with dirty feet on his own floor, to the children that they dirty the washbasin, nailed the window of the living room, and that it gives you a lot of work?
In the event that you suffer from this obsession, try to keep in mind that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness should not be in the first place in the family.
However, this harmless desire for cleanliness can ruin your relationships and even family peace.
The work of survival
"Put this worn overcoat into the trash."
"Are you going to put these old socks on tomorrow?"
"A wet towel has nothing to do on the ground."
If you do this spade work on your partner this way several times a day, you will really decompose it.
It's obvious that you don't think badly you want everything to be impeccable.
Maybe if the men knew, the women wouldn't have to do so much digging...
Defamation, persiflation
Defamation, persiflation but also insults against someone are also the property of some women.
Women are particularly involved in relations and thus are happy to deal with topics such as, where, with whom, how and why.
Maybe each of us lets us escape a little harmless persiflation here and there.
The hand on the heart, however, is a peculiarity of women.
But the worst are those who advise, persipate, even despise others and are for their surroundings - especially at work in a group of women - particularly dangerous.
Jagr and Voracek helped by their participation in the Philadelphia victory
The hockeyist attacker Jagr participated twice in Philadelphia's victory during the NHL Monday game on Caroline's ice and is again leading productive Czech players for the competition.
From the perspective of the 39-year-old star Claude Giroux, who has made an extra pass and was named the best player in the game, he scored in both cases.
Jakub Voracek, who plays with Jagr also recorded two goals during the game.
Jagr after the game told the journalists of overseas that he had warned Giroux that it would be a great evening.
"I told him before the game that he would give his hat-trick."
"I heard it."
"Once this feeling falls upon you," Jagr explained after his action Giroux marked a goal of the first shot of the Flyers.
A moment later there was a second assault on the Czech team.
Voracek fought behind the goals of the Hurricanes for the palette and presented it to the drummer Maxime Talbot.
A second before the first break, the local player Patrick Dwyer made a descent, but the beginning of the second part belonged to the Flyers.
Concretely in Giroux.
In cooperation with Jagr he scored three goals, followed by Wayne Simmonds transforms a fourth goal.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't mean he's the best league player but he's really one of the best three," Jagr said about his center.
"I never thought I'd be playing at the end of my career with a hokeyjiste like him."
"I'm really glad about it."
"I want to play on him."
"All these years at NHL the other team players have tried to play on me, now it's my turn," Jagr added.
Caroline made a drama of this game because with a goal of Tuom Ruutu and Dwyer again on a penalty shot she ends up with a difference of a goal.
Matt Read did not rule out other complications that end up two against one.
"Pronger has made excellent attacks in our area."
"He hit the pallet, I took speed and (Read) went to the farthest corner of the cage.
"I tried to hit him and I got there," describes the final goal of the game from his point of view Voracek.
Philadelphia arrived with this victory in the head of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav Spacek did not finish the match with Buffalo he went out in the second third because of an injury to the upper body.
The Candians did not face an experienced defence defender whose advance of two butsets were lost after a penalty shot by 2:3.
Tomas Plekanec has not transformed any of their attacks.
That's the fact that the back line was sick that mainly haunted the local coach rather than lost fists because they played the game only with 5 defenders.
"It's nothing."
"We played the game only with an experienced player, the rest were young."
"But there's nothing to be done, that's how," says Jacques Martin.
"Replacement on replacement is not enough and we couldn't resist."
"We just had to simplify the game, push the palette out of our area."
For this we had limits," added one of P.K. Subban's defenders.
Ondrej Pavelec, Czech defender participated in Winnipeg's thirtieth attack and victory on Tampu Bay.
5 different shooters participated uax goals of the Jets, who arrested a series of 5 lost matches.
How travel prices have changed since 1989
Until 1989 there were only 5 state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.
Travel agencies at that time proposed travel mainly in the socialist bloc countries, as travel to the west was very limited.
Czech tourists traveled for the holidays in East Germany, Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea and the Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A great exception for the period from 1962 to 1972 when he was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia and then the regime began to have an inclination for the west and travels to Yugoslavia were very limited for Czech tourists.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that it was not allowed for the citizens of the socialist bloc (also for the Czechoslovakians) to travel individually even within the framework of socialist countries.
If the Czechoslovak citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter or the individual trip was not allowed.
Travel agencies at that time also offered trips to the west, however, it was necessary to queue all night with a sleeping bag or have a "good knowledge" within the travel agency.
And even after that it had not yet been won.
The currency agreement that was the condition to travel west was denied to "politically incorrect" people who could not travel at all.
However, the Czechoslovak currency was not interchangeable and it was not possible to obtain financial resources without the currency agreement (Western currency) to travel west.
The Czechs spent most of their vacations in the country where therefore there were many country houses and cottages that the Czechs bought and this habit lasts until now.
Since 1989 the Czech voyages have been undergoing a major revolution.
Although until 1989 the holidays in East Germany and Bulgaria were at most, the Czechs spent 4 million vacation days abroad last year in countries around the world.
The great paradox that we are not aware of today is that the most popular country is Croatia, where it was not possible to go freely until 1989 as part of the Yugoslavia of the time.
The abolition of visas in the 90s of the last century in the neighbouring countries of the West has caused a huge wave of short-term visits mainly in Austria and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not travel for a long time by plane to the west that everyone wanted to see at least a moment.
For example, in Paris, the Czech travel organizations slept in tents in parks because our income did not allow us to pay the hotel or a pension.
The typical feature of a Czech trip was at that time to take with itself its own preserved food, sausage, etc... to save.
Another important moment was the interchangeability of the Czech krona which finally allowed our tourists after decades of free purchasing power from the Western currency.
Our standard of living and the average wage increased, which led to another important time around 1997.
Through an increasing demand for travel travel, travel agencies have started to prepare tours with air charter connections since 1997 which through contracts have greatly reduced costs compared to what was previously.
By the end of the 1990s the Czechs had visa-free links with virtually most developed countries around the world apart from the EU that later facilitated our journeys.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolution tourism, when the first air charter was prepared for an exotic country, Thailand, from the Czech Republic.
Since this year and every year direct air charters take Czech tourists to distant hot countries; this winter there will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic.
More than 100,000 Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
Another interesting moment in this period that symbolizes our post-revolution development came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the EU abolished visas for Czech tourists and allowed our country to fully join the group of developed countries.
In 2008 the Czechs also spent more than half of their vacation abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in history spent more than 15,000 crowns per person on vacation abroad including the accompanying charges.
The General Assembly must find its President but this may end with a situation without "a bed" solution
Almost 5 months ago Czech football is without President and it is likely that Ivan Hasek's successor to the Czech Republic's Football Association will not yet be known after yet a General Assembly to be held Thursday in Nymburk.
However, there is still no agreement according to which voting regulation must be made.
Without this agreement it is not possible to start voting for one of the three candidates.
Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are interested in the management of Czech football.
Hasek resigned in June and on his departure he called his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality that will lead football in the future.
Only during the time after Hasek the football went back to differences between the Association's chambers that cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was fully demonstrated on September 16 when a new president had to be chosen.
Delegates of the General Assembly met unnecessarily in the National House in Prague because negotiation was blocked and there was no question of how to elect.
There was no agreement on knowing who had the right to vote in the General Assembly - only, as it were, statutory representatives or also full-powered officials.
In this single point there has been a partial agreement since then with the assistance of the Office for State and Law, according to which representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
Differences still remain in relation to the regulation for election.
It is too clear that the Executive Committee, which in its planned or extraordinary negotiations, has also brought nothing to the situation.
Opinions on the possibility of voting have changed several times, but the issue remains the same.
The question is how to proceed for the third round so as not to fall into the bed.
"The difference apple lies in the following fact: either proceed according to the statutes or find another model," was one of the three Vice-Presidents of the Czech Football Association Dusan Svoboda, representing professional football within the association.
According to the rules of the proposed model wins in the third round that of the candidates who have received the highest percentage vote in the chamber for which he is a candidate.
Moravia is ready according to what is said to withdraw to win the candidate who has received the largest percentage of vote in the two chambers.
And the Czech side studies the condition that the winner should have at least two thirds of the percentages of votes.
"Only then would it lose the idea of two previous laps and it would completely deny the bicameral concept," Svoboda admits, which understands the objections of the Moravian party and believes that it would be best not to change the regulation and vote according to the existing statutes.
It is surprising that Tomas Paclik is also in agreement even though he believes that the election settlement established according to the Pelta's most advantageous status among all candidates.
"I would like to see a maximum vote according to the association's statutes."
"So that there are not yet any bloody ideas imagined by a representative as in the past General Assemblies," said Victoria Plzen's owner, who is a candidate for the first time and who, in his presentations, has defined himself above all against Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him in Nymburk there will be a new President and believes that candidates will cooperate in the future together and constructively.
"The possible qualification in the European Championship today should calm everyone."
"Football will again be on a wave of happiness and there will be more training for cooperation," added Jablonec's officer, who among the three has the greatest experience in managing football both professionally and regionally.
Rajchl is more pessimistic.
"I believe in this agreement but unfortunately the situation is very tense."
"This is not a problem between the Czechs and the Moraves, but there are trends in wanting to change regulations to design."
"This can once again result in a blockade in the General Assembly."
"I still hope that the right reason will win," said Rajchl.
There is not much time left for agreement common to all parties.
Some meetings should take place directly in Montenegro but can say whether the entire football management will be complete for the game.
The specially chartered flight in which they were to travel to Podgorice, among others Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, did not take off for technical reasons and was looking for an alternative to take part of the Executive Committee on the ground of reprisals.
At the end it is the ministerial meeting, which could take place on Wednesday, which should be decisive.
The Minister of Youth Education and Sports Joseph Dobes would be very happy to receive the torn parts of the country's strongest sports association and bring them to an agreement.
In the game there are many: state staffing, the credibility of football and also the General Assembly of the Czech Sports Union that must determine the management of Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclik is going to fight for the position of President because he sees no correct candidate.
If the head of footballers of Plzen Tomas Paclik had seen before the General Assembly whose profile would have responded to everything he requested for a new President of the Czech Republic's Football Association (AFRT) he would not be campaigned for this high function.
"If such a candidate exists I support him, I fight for him and I do not present myself to the election."
"But in the current situation it was not possible to find such a candidate," Paclik told the Czech Press Agency (CTK).
Paclik's motivation is to compete with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl to just try to prevent Pelta from gaining access to the head of the AFRT that would previously be given favor for this election.
Paclik also points out that in the event that he would win the election he would hold this position as President only until 2013 as planned for a General Assembly.
He would well see in the function an experienced and high-level manager but not related to the world of football.
"I talked to people who would have the profile," he says.
"For me it was terrible when some told me they didn't want to be identified with Czech football right now."
"I would like to change this image," he added.
What is said, above all, disrupts Paclik, is the relationship between Pelta and the President of the Regional Football Union of Plzen Roman Berbr, a man of the notorious defeat who is known behind the scenes as a lobbyist able to influence the vote of delegates ' the General Assembly.
For Paclik, it is not acceptable for Pelta to take this position as President.
"If he won, the current state would remain and there would be nothing new in football."
"And with the support of Berbr, who is a high-flight trader, it would be even less favourable to football," Paclik proclaimed.
What still shocks is the fact that Pelta's name was pronounced a few years ago in the course of an investigation into a case of corruption, for which Pelta went unpunished.
"I don't know what Pelta's prestige would bring to football."
"And how would we be considered in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA" said Paclik, who once declared "if Pelta becomes President, I sell the Plzen club".
In the event that Paclik would triumph at Thursday's vote, he should prove that he could cooperate with Felta.
Rajchl, another candidate who had been supported by Paclik prior to the September General Assembly that had ended by a fiasco, thinks the same thing.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I'd go with."
"He has great abilities"
"He would be able to present himself for example as head of representation."
"But as manager of the Association he wouldn't be able."
"I don't put my nose in what I don't know," says Paclik, who in September drew great attention when he spoke for the annulment of the Arbitration Commission with Ludek Macela who replaced Dagmar Damkova.
Paclik claims that he would be at the level to lead the Association.
He took as an example his ability to run private companies and also has been running the Plzen club since last year, which celebrated his first division triumph with his support last May.
"I have the strength to change something in the world of sport and to bring about a certain culture."
"I would stop the influence of certain interested groups that, for example, tend to influence the Disciplinary and Appeal Commission, which leads to situations of bad taste," added Paclik, who does not look for his antipathy for the leader of Sparta Daniel Kretinsky.
It would also consider harmonization of relations with the Czech Olympic Committee whose lobbying power in high-level policies would enable more money to be obtained from gambling tax for sport.
"This is one of the key points the new President should take care of."
"If this is about gambling tax as stated by political parties, I understand their arguments but they should also tell where the money goes," he said.
Paclik does not take his current connection with the Plzen club as something negative even though he claims that the President of the AFRT should be "over the parties".
Pelta is again connected with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla from Prague.
"This is not the ideal."
I see no reason to pass my shares from the Plzen club on to someone if I have to come back a year and a half later," Paclik said.
Pelta promised new statutes for AFRT that should end bed conditions.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the Miroslav Pelta presidency promised that if it is elected, the AFRT will have new statutes that should put an end in the future to disputes about the electoral settlement.
Jablonec's grievor is ahead of the very optimistic Thursday meeting in Nymburk and believes that today's success in the football show should calm this fight down before the vote.
Before the election in September, Pelta had promised to devote itself to national representation and to obtaining financial resources if elected.
He decided to be a candidate at the last moment just before the past General Assembly and this two-month delay could well enable him to defend his vision of football leadership and present it in a broad context.
"People at all levels have been playing football for a long time and expect that there will be a President on Thursday."
"They feel that this is the best time for someone to take the lead of the Association," he added, but he is above all linked to the Jablonec club, worked for many years on Sparta and the Union Executive Committee.
This is also why he has enough experience to run Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the election is a euphoria that reigned at the time of Ivan Hasek.
"Unfortunately at the General Assembly of June of the Statutes were approved which were not perfect as everyone saw."
"If there were not all these various interpretations, we would have had a President since September," underlined Pelta.
It was precisely the revision of the most important document of the civic association that paid close attention to the delegates.
"If I become President, I take it as a personal mission and I am ready to take all responsibility in case it doesn't work."
"It is a principle without which we cannot exist," Pelta added.
Then he strives, it is said, not to confront his opponents.
He previously stated that he could cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl that he recognized his training in law and that he well knew that his opponent-candidate would be his first Vice-President.
Nor has he attacked Tonas Paclik for a long time, who, on the contrary, does not stop criticizing Pelta.
"He has evolved into football for a year and has already had some success."
"But his attacks were not the most honorable and surprised many people during the campaign."
"That is also why some now have doubts about his character," Pelta said to his opponent but remains faithful to his proclamations in September.
His strongest weapon is his knowledge of football from the lowest level competitions to the national representation.
It's supposed to be a football winemaker.
"And I would also try to finish all the cases that begin with that of the Bohemians or the aftermath of the corruption scandal."
"I would immediately enter into negotiations with the public and private sector so that we can get enough money for all football," said the Czech Press Agency CTK on the 46th candidate two months ago.
He also added that his appointment to the head of football would bring no change in people.
"I should get acquainted with all the employees," he told Strahov where there is understandable nervousness since there is no direction.
Although there are catastrophic scenarios planned with the General Assembly, he believes that delegates will not go to Nymburk for anything.
"If there's only one point of disagreement on how to vote in the third round we'll get over it."
"Football needs credibility and will only get it when there is a new leader in its head," as Pelta optimistically states two days before the likely day that it will determine its career as an official.
Rajchl promises that under his direction the AFRT would start working hard
"If current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl was elected new President of the Czech Republic's Football Association at the General Assembly on Thursday that would not please many people, he said.
However, Rajchl promises that if he is elected, he will start working hard.
He wants systemic changes and makes the members of the Executive Committee responsible for the different areas of football.
He also promised to settle the Bohemian case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work begun by predecessor Ivan Hasek.
"As President I want to take care of football as a whole."
"International contacts with UEFA and FIFA through national representation, professional football and performance football for youth."
"But I'm not saying I'll do all this alone," Rajchl said in an interview for CTK.
"I am a team player and want to distribute the skills within the Executive Committee so that each member deals with a specific field."
"And I will distribute difficult missions so that football faces a big step forward."
"Many people will not be happy because it will be about starting to work hard rather than criticizing others," he added.
He pointed out, it was said, that he would not represent himself as a candidate because of a critical atmosphere.
"About me, we know I work 20 hours a day."
"but I need to know if it's worth the shot and if I have people behind me who will constantly put sticks in my wheels and cast doubts on each of my actions," explaining why he hesitated.
"Many people have said to me anyway that I must not give up because they would also give up."
"It's a trust I can't betray," he says.
What motivates him, we say, is also to continue the work started with Hasek.
"Since the last two years there has been a great job of fact and I don't want to drop it."
"There are processes that have been launched that will have consequences in a few years and I would not like someone to stop them."He expressed with fear that in the case of the election of Miroslav Pelta the situation within the Union does not come back as it was before Hasek.
"I believe in systematic work and this is something Mirek Pelta cannot do."
"After him are people who would make football in such a way that it would only be for those who have been chosen."
"You can blame me for a number of things, but surely you can't bear any."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to do football for everyone because everyone will not be happy only those who have been chosen
And he confirms again that he would only be a President for Czech Republic.
"And if anyone says otherwise, I'm ready to do my best for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider that the second division is divided into two parts one Czech and the other Moravian whose winners would be in the first division."
"There would be no situation as currently with only three Moravian teams in the division because the current problem is finding young players.
As Tomas Paclik, president of the Plzen Club, entered the competition for the position of President, Rajchl cannot evaluate his own chances of winning.
"I am constantly feeling support from the Czech Chamber which has elected me its Vice-President and knows that there will be successes with me," Rajchl said who is considering among his future successes saving tens of millions of crowns on disadvantageous contracts, negotiation of contracts with television and the gambling law.
On the contrary, he says that the fact that the Association is not united is a common fault for all.
While he says about Pelta "that he is disqualified because with him the Czech football would lose his credibility," he thinks that the second opponent Paclik is a strong candidate who has what to offer to football.
"No one can question Plzen that he did a wonderful job this year."
"If he was elected he would certainly continue in what Hasek started and would not make any significant change among the people in the Commissions."
"He wouldn't want to spoil his success," said Rajchl, who evaluated his rivals.

Ovni optical pataugeores, magnificent swimming pools in Budapest: Who travels across Europe can live his blue miracle - and after turning the city or taking a long walk- can let his tired legs rest in hot water baths.
A book shows in which swimming pool one can experience the most well-being.
When Iris Meder was on a search trip during the last 18 months, there is an object that should not be missing in his luggage: his swimwear.
She lay on her back in the water, observed the artisticly arranged coupons, and swam against the Putten marbles that waited on the other side of the pool and could not help admiring the Art Nouveau meticulously restored of these converted pools.
If a covered swimming pool pleased her, she immediately noticed in her notebook all the details worthy of interest about the type of construction and the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools were surveyed in this way by the historian of Meder architecture and she presented them in her previously published book: "Badefreuden (Joies du Bain". The municipal covered pools of Münich, the historical bath palaces in the black forest, "concrete buildings Hardcore" in Taunus.
In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true fervent of bathing culture.
Meder, explains that she does not have much interest in sport but she feels attracted to water in a totally different way.
It's annoying that swimmers should just look at blue tiles and settle down from the javel water well while the joggers breathe perfume from the spice forests or can listen to the park's happy bird gas.
"I wondered one day why swimming pools must in fact always be if ugly," said the Viennese.
"So I started a collection of beautiful bathrooms."
The surface of the water double-enhanced architecture
A dive into a pool and volatile sauna oils - wellness factor in swimming rooms are huge because all senses are awake, according to Meder.
And if the builders had given themselves a little more pain, the swimming rooms could be a real delight for the eyes: "Instead of a floor we have a surface of water in the swimming rooms."
"It is on the one hand transparent, but on the other it reflects the beauty of the entire building."
All surfaces appear optically in a double way: high vaults, multi-coloured tiles, trampling.
The small image volume "Badefreuden" makes an interesting 190-page report on the history of architecture and culture on the oasis of historical well-being - it certainly gives a desire to make a leap in the blue.
The collector Meder discovered remarkable copies during her research in Hungary.
In addition to the splendid wellness baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, she found water containing nitrate in a natural cave in the Karst (a cavern bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) and a thermal bath whose pools are filled with water containing alkali and (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászbereny) and located in a bottle-shaped building.
On the other hand, the heated outdoor swimming pools of Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views. As long as a roof of the Zürich bath one has the whole city in its eyes, one can admire the snowy Arlberg from an outdoor swimming pool of St. Anton: The Turkish bath is equipped with a window from which you can watch the animation on the ski track.
Perhaps the most extraordinary swimming pool design awaits swimmers in Längenfeld: The Aqua Dome Ötztal looks like an UFO that has just landed on the Alps.
In winter, steam rises from the three open plateaus, while in the background the Ötztal mountains rise to the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
The smell of the water of Javel does not emanate from all the swimming pools in the Meder collection.
Many thermal baths emanate from a sulphur odor, from the Árpád-spa in the Hungarian Bekescsaba emanate from a strong smell of oil, which is hard to believe, from a healthy spa.
The smell comes from therapeutic alkaline waters containing carbon hydrogen that is almost black and its lemon glues to your skin as soon as you let yourself slide into the pool - a special spa experience.
During her search for the beautiful pools, Iris Meder was also disappointed: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free outdoor and outdoor pool of Czechoslovakia, she found herself in front of a barricaded land.
The bath designed by architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902 was closed in the meantime.
Looking through the window of the New Art building in red-white-yellow, she observed the growth of weeds between the tiles.
It observed a negative effect in a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: Bad Wildbad's thermal palace.
This building has already survived three phases; it can be discovered not only neo-Roman elements that come out of its design in 1844 but also a maurial room in the Alhambra style that was added to it in 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the thermal palace remains the favorite bath of the swimming pool expert, Iris Meder - and not only because it originated from Schwarzwald.
"It's already a good performance that blends construction styles so different into such a formidable unit," Meder says.
With such a palace, diving in the thermal pool is apparently only a minor matter.
Agricultural speculation
The German Bank examines in detail speculation on raw materials
By Christian Teevs
Does the German bank abandon its speculation on raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann commissioned a working group to look for the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the head of the group then wants to see the consequences.
Hamburg -
For the citizens of the Federal Republic, this is clear: According to one study, 84% of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate on raw materials such as corn and wheat.
Two thirds of the respondents even require that the German bank and other credit institutions discontinuate this business avenue because it increases the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on the order of consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report submitted by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In this article, author Harald Schumann points out that the speculation of the Stock Exchanges on global raw materials increases prices upwards and that banks share a complicity in global famine.
The consumer protection campaign is specifically aligned with the head of the Deutsche-Bank, Josef Ackermann, although large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley are acting the same way.
The speculation on raw materials was initially introduced to protect merchants against price fluctuations.
But the majority of experts in the meantime share the view that betting players have taken a break from offers and demand - and take advantage of the costs of the very poor.
Ackermann reacted to the criticism of the American competitors differently: He promised to investigate the complaints and said, "There is no case worth putting into question the good reputation of the Deutsche Bank".
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the accusations of Foodwatch-Report.
The review must be completed by the end of the year, then the results of the Deutsche Bank Board of Directors must be presented - with recommendation, usually.
At the end of January, the head of the Bank will indicate the consequences.
This could result in a reduction in the market for raw materials, or even a complete abandonment.
Ackermann built his Image
The head of Foodwatch Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time confirmed his criticisms of the financial sector: "The speculation on the rise in food prices shows in a particularly dramatic way, to what extent today's banks are detrimental to the general interest."
Ackermann is the first bank lobby to be particularly required today.
"The Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio, for which money has been invested in food speculation," Bode said.
"It doesn't matter, for Mr. Ackermann, whether it's about the hungry people or whether the reputation of the Deutsche Bank is at stake."
Ackermann's awareness may seem surprising at first sight, but it is clear that the CEO of the group wishes to present a perfect image, a few months before leaving his duties.
The Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the President of the Board of Directors will not change anything to what is planned within the Board of Directors.
It could improve its brand image by abandoning controversial agricultural speculations.
And with regard to possible losses, he has little to worry about - his successor will worry about it.
One in two would terminate investments on raw materials.
Foodwatch strives to maintain strong pressure on the Manager.
So far more than 30,000 netizens have already participated in the organization's campaign.
Bode published the Tuesday survey, with which on 7 and 8 November the Forsa Institute conducted questionnaires for 1001 people.
Just 11 percent found it legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers investments for which bets on food prices are made.
Many bank customers would also have personal consequences if they learned that their bank is involved in such operations: one in two would terminate, following the survey, all investments for which money is injected into speculation on raw materials.
43 per cent would advise such a bank around them, 49 per cent replied that they would consider the termination of their account to change banking institutions.
21st house in Vienna
The Pavilion That Moved
D'Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with tops, bottoms and a Happy End: the Austrian flag for the world exhibitions in Brussels in 1958 won prizes, was a museum in Vienna, remained empty and then fell to ruins.
Now it is open again and takes place as an exhibition house.
If we are excited about a modern post-war architecture, for its clear forms, its glass hangars, its vivid and bold allures and new building materials that are typical of belief in technical progress, then the flag of Austrian architect Karl Schwanzer for the universal exhibition of Brussels in 1958 is a good and famous example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion was previously awarded the "Grand Prix d'Architecture" for its construction in steel and glass, light and suspended.
Construction is considered to be an important step in contemporary architecture to date.
He made the architects so famous, that he also built the Pavilion for the following Austrian universal exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder BMW house and its adjacent bowl-shaped construction in Munich, it finally became internationally famous in 1973.
His draft pavilion as a temporary construction had been exhibited after the universal exhibition in the Swiss Garden at the station south of Vienna, was transformed, and in 1962 a museum of the 20th century opened -
But the building was neither physically nor technically suitable for a museum - no walls to hang works of art, so not a good environment.
However, it has been used so long, until contemporary art receives a new building in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and has become increasingly depleted.
Now architect Adolf Krischanitz has transformed the Pavilion, it now bears the name "House of the 21st Century" and will in the future be used as a museum for contemporary art.
Tuesday evening the museum Belvedère opened, to which the house belongs, the first exhibition - a chance shot at every point of view.
The new start was completed by Agnès Husslein-Arco, who became the new director in 2007 of the Austrian gallery Belvedère.
Husslein-Arco, has promoted an art historian to a considerable career, among other things in his youth as an artistic skater, later at Sotheby's, at the Guggenheim Museum and as a founding director of the Salzburg Museum of Modern Art, she has carried out especially the work of transformation with political men and the protection of monuments, she has obtained and established private public funds and sponsorship.
Except contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba whose foundation bears the same name have been exhibited there, a coffee shop and a library are there, and an office must be built there.
Strict monitoring, small budget
For the realization Krischanitz was therefore the ideal interpreter.
Not only because he had transformed and expanded with sensitivity the secession of Joseph Olbracht and he had won the contest, but because he had studied at the Technical University of Vienna and that for him the pavilion was "an extremely important place" where he had seen "practically every weekend" the exhibitions.
He knew the original project, and he knew the problems of the building, which lost in generosity and lightness as a result of his journey to Vienna and his change of use.
During the current transformations, there were major problems: the building was "an energy rush," says Krischanitz.
Glass facade window profiles were changed, glass insulation reinforced in glass fibers was laid and the roof was replaced by a special safety glass.
Thermal bridge beams have been strengthened or replaced, and asbestos-filled coatings have been rehabilitated.
Two basements have made room for the new farm, a light panel cut between the house and the road ensures the lighting, a bridge leading to the entrance - it is almost a new construction, but still the light Schwanzer Pavillon.
The original exterior doors have remained, the house is painted in a shade protection against red-brown rust.
And the cinema is even exactly the same as it used to be.
And all this under close supervision of the authorities responsible for monuments and with a small budget.
"Of course materials that are good and inexpensive should be found, and that are also pleasing to the protection office monuments," says Krischanitz and he draws attention to a crude ground in the basement.
Despite all constraints, problems and transformations, the building remained flexible and light.
This would have been difficult with the Pavilion, "which came from Brussels," said Krischanitz recently, a typical story of "Drop-in-the-City".
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "awaken the good conscience".
But in this case the House of the 21st century is not in the wrong place, because if this is a chance of urban construction: around the Swiss Garden is precisely the newly planned "quarter of the central station" with offices and apartments.
And another chance may occur: the 21st century House could benefit from the reinforcement of another construction Krischanitz, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berlin temporary art center, and as it is said, it already negotiates with the city in order to obtain a site in the vicinity of the Swiss Garden.
Bahn plans a winter crisis package in millions.
The railway company has developed a crisis plan, which aims to avoid winter train accidents.
The number of employees should double.
It costs millions.
In the fight against winter-related train accidents and delays, the “Deutsche Bahn” railway company will spend more than 70 million more this year in this regard.
The daily "Bild"-Zeitung reported beforehand invoking an internal crisis plan for the group, that investments of approximately EUR 300 million would be planned by 2015.
This should make it possible for vehicles and rail networks to be better available also in the case of extreme weather.
The number of internal and external employees for the denial of railway and dock facilities should, inter alia, double and increase to 16,000 people.
The aim is to clear the snow and ice tracks until the beginning of the service phase and 90 per cent of the track equipment required for service within four to five hours.
Two months ago the Chief of Station Rüdiger Grube warned the government and industry at a summit conference on train accidents that also took place this winter.
Last winter the railway company had a lot of problems with the transport of users, because it lacked reserves in the event of difficult weather conditions.
This is how many new regional trains have been awaiting authorization from the Ministry of Railways for years.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway company has had years of work to do since it had to verify the axles of the ICE trains more often at the workshop, after a break of axles took place on an ICE at the central station of Cologne.
The German bank "Deutsche Bank" pays millions of penalties in the USA.
After Chief Josef Ackermann's case there is a new one in the USA: the German bank "Deutsche Bank" must pay a fine worth millions.
As if the problems of the Deutsche Bank were not enough, the past of this giant sector also caught it in the USA: the Frankfurt Institute pays in comparison to $145 million (EUR 110 million) to settle a dispute due to the bankruptcy of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is about the sale of mortgage documents.
The NCUA Financial Market Regulator makes a whole series of accusations to large banks, which would have prompted cooperative banks to make false promises about the purchase of financial products; they would have minimized the risks.
These documents lost a lot of value during the financial crisis and led the banks down.
"We are satisfied that we have been able to find a solution in this regard, without the parties initiating proceedings in court," said a Deutsche Bank interlocutor in New York.
In comparison, the Bank has recognized no fault.
This also applies to the Citigroup, which committed itself to a payment of $20.5 million.
The President of NCUA Debbie Matz welcomed the concessions of the two banking institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) responsible for cooperative banks in the USA and intervenes in the event of bankruptcy in order to protect customer deposits.
NCUA is trying to repair the damage incurred by several billion dollars.
The comparisons now concluded are the first in their kind.
The regulator also took other large separate banks and in summer he signed before Court JP Morgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
With regard to the issue of mortgage documents it is "Mortgage-backed Securities".
Credit houses are at the base.
When the U.S. real estate bubble broke out in 2007, this was fatal for a large number of banking companies.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Even though the events are already a few years old, at present it is blowing on American banks a storm wind.
Investors and supervisory authorities have tried many ways to obtain redress or punish breaches.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the largest wave of complaints.
She blames 18 large international banks, the two US state real estate financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for taking advantage of in-kind mortgages of about $200 billion.
The Deutsche Bank is also required to file an appeal with the FHFA, which involves several operations of a total amount of $14.2 billion for the years 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authorities request that Frankfurter respond to "substantial losses" but without mentioning a precise amount.
Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as unjustified and stated that it wanted to defend itself.
WARREN Buffett increases by 10 billion at IBM
Buffett, the financial gurus, invests huge amounts in IBM's IT company.
Since March, he has purchased shares worth more than $10 billion.
Until then the large American investor Warren Buffett constantly explains not to invest in IT companies, since the long-term evolution of companies only shows bad predictions.
However, he has read IBM's reports and changed his view on investment in this sector.
It had already to be understood much earlier than IBM mainly offers services and IT systems for other companies' IT sectors.
Warren Buffett's investment is considered a knight attack in the finance world.
As a result, the IBM IT activity is granted the right to now be called "Mr. IBM".
Car Buffett revealed today at the CNBC economic show that since March he has purchased IBM shares worth $10.7 billion.
His investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway has thus become a large shareholder of IBM with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that IBM has never known anything about this commitment so far.
He congratulated the management, who even during the economic crisis had ensured reasonable benefits.
"You did a great job," Buffett said strategically.
IBM has been working on IT profit services for some time as "exploitation of accounting centres".
The computer pioneer, over 100 years of age, offers both software and consultation as well as very efficient business computers.
Buffett had so far rather avoided technology companies.
He says he only invests in companies that he understands business.
But rather, Buffett tackles the railway freight, lubricant or machine manufacturers.
Her Berkshire Hathaway holds almost 80 subsidiaries as well as shares with a whole series of major groups such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former municipal Rück.
This 81-year-old octogenary had resumed in the 1960s" the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway and erected it to one of the most prestigious companies in the world, thanks to intelligent investments.
However, its lifestyle is modest.
That is why it is a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of making money earned him the nickname "Omaha Oracle".
After the announcement of Buffett's investment IBM shares increased by one percent on the scholarship.
"Big Blue", also known as IBM, has a stock market value of over $220 billion and has Apple and Microsoft among the most valuable technology companies in the world.
In Microsoft, says Buffett, he doesn't want to participate.
Founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend.
The threat is palpable
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer cell" Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology", which would now be reborn.
The murders of eight Turkish nationals and a small Greek enterprise in the years 2000 to 2006 had an extremist background.
Following this news, Turkey and the German-Turkish population react with fear and concern.
For many German-Turkish people believed to have died for a long time: since the incendiary attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no more violence comparable to this far-right extremist context against the Turks.
However, there was never a question of xenophobia in Germany.
However, the right-wing extremist network that has been detected reveals proportions whose size is far from predictable.
"This is a return to bloody ideology," "Tel was the title of the online publication of the Turkish daily "Haberturk".
On the other hand, the newspaper "Sabah" points out that one of the authors would have been a v-man of the Protection of the Constitution, and is concerned that the German authorities could be involved in the extreme right-wing bottle.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted in a reasonable manner this weekend, calling for a silent commemoration of the victims of racial violence at the Brandenburg Gate.
It was only two weeks before the Turkish community in Berlin and German and Turkish policies had thought of a 50th anniversary ceremony of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
It was with gay colors that the cohabitation had been staged, symbolizing a success story.
The reports of certain Turkish media make a gifle effect: "Germany's gift for the fiftieth anniversary" is the title of an article in the Turkish platform- "Haber X", which refers to the context of the series of murders.
Therefore, the German publication of the "Hürriyet" does not prevent it from taking advantage of the unique conditions.
"It begins to grow", Tel is the title of the chronicle of Ahmet Külahci.
It points out that people would have been killed, paid taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany through their work.
Police action was perceived in a very critical manner on the German-Turkish forums and later discussed the success of their research.
Why it has not already come much earlier to the mind of the German authorities to do research in certain suspicious circles of extreme right, the authors are surprised.
More than one is prepared for at least rhetorical or drastic means: "If the case continues to be framed, it will remain for migrants nothing but self-defense and armament".
"this will be the best self-defense."
"Internal peace in Germany depends heavily on the quality of information and the relevance of the punishment of the entire network," says Selen.
What this means is whether internal peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s have explained well.
The photo of the ruins after the Solingen fire is deeply embedded in the German and Turkish memory.
Because no other event has made it more clear to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans, on which mistrust and distance by acts of violence could lead.
The attacks, however, have sharpened the feeling of us in the Turkish community.
Never repeat past mistakes
In the past it was mainly the failure of German politics after the attacks the Turkish press complained about: Helmut Kohl refused to visit Mölln's survivors.
After the Solingen fire he sent a telegram of condolences to the Head of Turkish State, he was represented at the funerals in Cologne by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel at the time in his speech, how many taxes the local Turkish population produced.
As if a man's value could be assessed on the amount of his tax charges.
The current report of the Turkish media shows once again how deep the mistrust of many Germano-Turkish people has been with the state of local law since that date.
In addition to the efforts of further clarification and re-evaluation of extreme-right terrorism in Germany, a clear message is needed this time.
The scandal bank of Lake Zürich
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The U.S.U.S. has nearly failed in the financial crisis and skate in the meantime from one crisis to another.
It's a German who has to lead now.
That's certainly not what Axel Weber imagined.
After his spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank, it was known in July, that he would occupy an almost as spectacular position in 2013: President of the Board of Directors of the Swiss Bank UBS - a major step towards an unexpected and lucrative career.
Axel Weber was publicly delighted, greeted; Switzerland for its beauty and the BUS for its recently obtained strength and made friendly comments about future colleagues.
"The U.S.B. has succeeded the Turnaround."
"I welcome the collaboration with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
And yet, since September it was clear that everything was going to change.
A UBS securities dealer in London had diverted all the Bank's security systems and had burned about 1.7 billion euros.
The head of the board of directors of the U.S. Oswald Grübel, a well-known banker not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
from the President of the Board of Directors of the UBS has been regarded as suffering - and they all ask: When does Axel Weber come back at last?
We have already learned that Weber can be advised from the bank from February 2012.
And he will resume the administration presidency already in May - not in 2013, as reported by the bank on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber this becomes difficult.
He is not a banker, much more professor of economy and President of the bank, and he would certainly have needed a period of adaptation.
At that time he assumed responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which had just once again proved that it had long earned the title "Europe's largest scandal bank".
Indeed, the UBS is on one huge side - until recently, it was the largest asset manager in the world, and on the other, it has been skating for years from one scandal to another.
Nothing, it seems, spares the proud Swiss bank.
This began during the financial crisis.
Until 2007 the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the Swiss asset manager, silent and solid, but also Russian, had combined it with ambitious objectives: it also wanted to become, in the area of banking investment, a very large bank.
So the UBS managed on one side in 2007 with $1.6 billion more money from an easy clientele than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, it had advanced as an investment bank in the league of the world's largest banks.
That was impressive.
Former banker Hans Geiger and later bank teacher for many years in Zurich relates: "I have always taken the UBS as a model of good bank in front of my students."
"In the current perspective, we wonder how could I simply have been wrong at this point?"
He was deeply wrong.
In 2007, it appeared that for the first time something was not going round at the UBS.
In the middle of the year, President Peter Wuffli withdrew surprisingly, which was considered to be a high intellectual as well as a great banker.
A few months later, we felt the reason why he was gone.
The division of the bank had burst with sub-prime documents and had to cross over billions.
To support this, the UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs and made a cross over.
For this she actually found investors, but who had recently broken the eyebrows: a non-transparent Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund, which was silent, to the point that we have never even learned its name.
However, this was only the first time.
In April 2008, it got worse.
The bank had to announce again losses amounting to billions, and the president of the board of directors Marcel Ospel, who was still in 2006 the second most well-paid board of directors in Switzerland, withdrew.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: the UBS was in the financial crisis before bankruptcy and had to be saved by the state, given its investment errors.
The National Bank has redeemed to the UBS the tens of billions of problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation has given six billion francs for bonds convertible into shares, for which it could become the co-owner of the bank.
All Switzerland has been shaken - because it has noted how dramatic this can be for a small country, to shelter so large banks.
Finally, the total UBS 2007 balance sheet was more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see chart).
"We couldn't save the U.S.U.S. once again," says bank researcher Geiger.
After the first disaster it followed the second.
Already a few months earlier, the UBS had capitulated because of a tax dispute with America and expressed its readiness to publish the easy customer data, which might have cheated the tax with the help of the Bank.
In addition, it accepted a payment of $780 million - in return for unwarranted profits from these operations with a higher fine.
Thus the UBS published more or less that it had helped tax fraud.
At the same time she lost something that has always been her capital in competition with the rich customers: the prestige of discretion.
After the scandal the Swiss banking secret was no longer the same.
It followed the withdrawal of the head of the board of directors and the chairman of the board of directors.
And the exodus of customer money.
Thus, in a few months the bank had lost its credibility in the two main business sectors: banking investment due to bad speculation and asset management due to tax fraud aid.
And, as there was somewhat a return to calmness, and as we thought, that the UBS would get away with it, it followed this unfortunate story of title merchants: a single merchant of title is worth 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realizes that something was not going round.
And it is published: with risk management in investment bank it still does not seem to work.
"With the Adoboli case, it was found that the control of risks has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, economist and professor of finance at the Banking Institute of the University of Zurich.
So the financial director of a large German bank is certain: "the problem of the UBS is that it does not have control of the risks in hand."
However, it was exactly the idea of caution, with which the Swiss bankers had long taken up their role, that of becoming guardian of the great fortune of the world: not too great risks, but security for money - and the world could well collapse beyond the Alpine republic.
The treasures of Swiss banks had become the symbol of unwavering reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli are for a particularly noble chocolate.
The UBS plant in Zurich is still going to match with the strong private Swiss bank's cliché - it's just a little bigger.
Already the situation is classic.
The Bank has its seat at Zurich Central Station, which leads directly from the Central Station to Lake Zurich, which itself is surrounded by the snowy summits of the Swiss mountains.
Buildings are prestigious here, store rentals are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelry such as Tiffany's are found here among Swiss tradition stores as well as those of the Sprüngli Confectionery.
For centuries Swiss bankers have lived here: from the national bank to the Swiss Credit Palace to private elite banks such as Julius Bär.
We arrive in the U.S. entrance hall by a heavy door.
Inside, the walls are covered with marble, front are thick leather chairs, and next to the bank logo, a large label for "safe".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has one day or the other excluded from the market - or betrayed the two major Swiss banks, the UBS and the Swiss Credit, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He would rather not read his name in the newspaper, finally like all Swiss bankers he does business with the two big banks as well.
The UBS would have become too large, it found - especially in banking investment, where the Anglo-Saxons would also have spread.
The Swiss would have nothing to say.
"And yet, they have long adapted to the moods of Anglo-Saxons."
This was indeed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank that changed the UBS, it made high profits and then the gap: no European financial institution has lost as much money in the sub-prime jungle as the large Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on 15 October 2008.
"On Wednesday, the government coalition of the small country to seven million people undertook the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "The Crash of the UBS".
With up to 68 billion francs, or 45 billion euros, politicians agreed to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How could this happen?
If we talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem mainly at the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks concluded a huge group together.
A bank has been created, which was already too large for small Switzerland - and has continuously recorded an increase.
What helped is that the two different predecessive banks of the UBS have completed: a rich bank, but in lethargy with as a strong point the management of assets in Zurich and a poorer one, but certainly already stronger internationalized.
Suddenly, international investment banks had favourable access to a lot of money, with which they were able to turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with the rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 Head of the UBS Group, and Marcel Ospel, formerly Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the great modest intellectual, which is very well understood in models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive, who has broken a path to the summit with the learning of the bank."
But Ospel would have trusted him to the end in Wuffli.
And wuffli would probably have made a decisive mistake at the end: "He thought his models were the reality," Geiger said.
"It's a tragic fall."
Tragic, maybe.
One thing is clear: the exuberance came before the fall.
The U.S. personnel clearly remember the meetings of the leaders during which the leader of the Wuffli group always spoke the same word of order: dethroning Goldman Sachs.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank on the planet.
She commanded the "League Tables" the rankings, which at that time documented the success of the banks.
After all the U.S.S. wanted to climb all the way up.
Some steps have already succeeded him.
In the case of foreign exchange and securities transactions it has played a very important role.
However, the business advisors, who were responsible for this, highlighted a weakness: in international interest operations, in the bank jargon "Fixed Income", there would be a huge difference from the largest banks.
The UBS would have gaps in US mortgage products.
To fill this gap, the UBS embarked on an adventure, which almost cost him his life.
It is the bank itself and a management fund created before it in the US subprime investments that have invested.
It turned into a massive machine that packaged and passed value documents based on US mortgages - but also retained risks.
Even when other banks have been looking for a long time to go down.
"In the summer of 2007, while the U.S. real estate market was on fire, the U.S. bought it there," says Geiger, the bank expert.
The bigger the euphoria the more the fall is brutal.
One manager after the other had to leave, when putting an end to the attempts proved more difficult than we thought.
Positions at UBS have become ejectable and have so far become benches.
The one who runs the big bank has an almost impossible task.
He must find a strategy for a bank, for which all the suggested business models have disappeared.
The bank researcher Geiger already has an idea: to end the investment bank, concentration on property management, return to Swiss roots.
But the bank does not want (yet) to go so far.
But the investment bank must be vigorously atrophied, as much as it is clear so far.
Next Thursday bank leader Sergio Ermotti wants to present to the world his future strategy.
The 51-year-old Italian-Switzerland was only supposed to be transitional when the bank separated with surprise from its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he went ahead: he had to conduct the U.S. business on a long-term basis, and reported to the Bank of Zurich on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to the state of progress in the mid-1990s.
It cancels 3,500 jobs.
But that's not gonna be enough.
The U.S.U.S. needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber has certainly already asked himself.
He says publicly until now only that he will be looking for an apartment in Zurich with his wife.
Next year.
Fear of the recession in Europe weighs on the American stock exchange
The threat of a recession in Europe at the end of the week discouraged American investors.
The change of government in Athens and Rome remained without impact.
The industrial production jugulated on the continent has suffocated the hopes of a stabilisation of the debt crisis in its germ.
The general relief on government change in Rome and Athens could not be imposed.
The euro has fallen compared to the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass I still had only half full last week, not half empty - but now the problems are rushing forward again, said Mark Luschini von Janney Montgomery Scott.
Most of the financial values were on the sales sheets.
The Dow-Jones-Index defaults noted a loss of approximately 0.6% to 12.078 points at the closing of the markets.
During the trade, the market barometer fluctuated between 12027 and 12170 points.
The S & P 500 index taken more broadly at 1251 points, a deficit of 1%
Nasdaq, the index of the technology grant lost 0.8%, and ended up with 2657 market points.
In Frankfurt, the Dax ended with a decrease of 1.2% to 5985 points.
The industry in the 17 euro area countries has significantly reduced its production and adjusted at the end of the recovery.
As announced by the Eurostat Statistics Office, companies produced in September, 2% less than in the previous month.
American investors expressed sceptically: "We are not an island, however dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman's management.
Europe will not soon be able to recover from a recession, and there are also other signs of weakness from banks.
The legendary investor, Warren Buffett, has only confirmed this caution: "it is not yet clear whether Europe would be strong enough to do something to put an end to the crisis," he said in an interview with CNBC.
Therefore, it was in his view too early to invest in obligations from European states and banks.
Instead, Warren Buffett has thrown an old principle of decades into the wind and entered the American technology industry.
Its investment of more than $10 billion to IBM supported the course of action of this traditional group, and made it worth almost 1% against the trend of commercial management.
The paper ended almost unchanged at $187.35.
Buffett claims to have paid an average of $170 per piece, and now holds 5.5 per cent.
The share price of its investment company Berkshire Hathaway lost 1.3%.
Bank of America's shares have yielded to 2.6%, significantly higher than the market.

The Boeing aircraft increased its business and therefore limited the losses in the Dow.
The shares won 1.5% after the company collected the largest order in its history.

719 values increased, 2281 yielded and 79 remained unchanged.
On Nasdaq, turnover closed to 1.38 billion shares with more than 630, a minus of 1913 and 82 unchanged.
Smart cornellas spread in cities
In many places, brakes are considered to be "bird problem" but experts claim that these very intelligent animals have not been allowed to drive cities away for a long time.
Some people like them, some others want to get rid of them as quickly as possible. The cornellas belong to the city for centuries, but in many communities the complaints of residents are increasing due to animal dirt and noise.
An antidote against the "°bird problem" is not yet in sight.
During the first ostfriesisch symposia on the cornellas, experts said it was no longer possible to hunt the brakes of the cities.
Experts from all over Germany have deliberated on possible solutions.
They are looking for alternatives in cities
Nature protectors based the problems of cities also on the exodus of particularly protected brakes: The use of chemicals in agriculture increasingly destroys traditional vital spaces.
Hunting, designing and slaughtering typical hatchery trees made life difficult for birds.
The cornellas are under the protection of nature.
There are large colonies with more than 600 cove couples in the westfälischen Soest, in the northwest including Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project had gained negative publicity because of the massacre of the cornellas in this region.
Critics have found bird capture in traps and their killing with particularly brutal claws.
"The normal expulsion, the ebony, is useless," noted Leer's planner and landscape, Werner Klöver.
The destruction of nests using pressure water or cutting down trees often produces adverse consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr to Bade-Wurtemberg.
"The animals move away, the large colonies divide and they disperse in other places."
The evence is imaginable only in exceptional cases as in hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
"We find ourselves forced to live with them, we can no longer exterminate them."
The problem is not resolved in cities without the inclusion of the periphery, according to Mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer's opinion.
Conceivable is a combination of the equineing of animals with a perverse conditioning and squeaky offers to enable them to relocate elsewhere.
Psychologist and ethnologist, Uta Maria Jürgens predicted "info panels instead of slicers" to establish completely different relationships with them: "We can finally better support a button on the face with a dose of self-confidence."
Jürgens co-founded the Ascheberger-road-educational of the baskets in Schleswig-Holstein, road signs informing about the life of these very intelligent brakes.
This project has been adopted by tourists in the meantime.
Jürgen gave his own opinion on the criticism of bird noise: "Here is a lot of communication, these birds have a lot to say."
The intelligence and ability of animals are legendary: The brakes not only use working instruments to reach a regal but they themselves manufacture their tools as working instruments.
An etologist at Cambridge University tested four chills recently, to what extent the intelligence of birds comes.
In an experiment, birds quickly learned that they had to have a skewered with stones to reach a larvae.
Without much training, they strongly recognized that a stone had to have some size and shape to collapse the platform.
In a second test, the cunning cornellas then had to solve a more difficult problem.
In a vertical cylinder, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a larvae.
Birds could not reach their bottom with their beak.
However, the researchers had made available iron cords at their disposal.
All four animals formed a hook with the help of which they fished the small bucket of the small pipe.
Three of the four brakes were successful even from the beginning.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal at the 2012 European Championship
The hopes of the Bosnians and Turks were unsuccessful.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and Ireland will participate in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland bought the last tickets at the 2012 European Championship in Poland and suddenly eliminated Ukraine.
Driven by the superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd), Portugal went against Bosnia-Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and perfected, after 0:0 of the game, its fifth participation in the European championship.
The Czechs have reached the elimination return game by Montenegro 1:0 (0:0), while the first round (2:0), had already been an obvious thing.
There was also no more burning in the 0:0 zero match between Turkey against Croatia, Ireland took a 1:1 (1:0) release against Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored the other shots for Portugal.
The former player of the Bundesliga Wolfsburg, Zvjezdan Misimovic, with an 11 metre-pennality played by hand (41st) and Captain Emir Spahic (65th) twice made a shortcut for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic was confronted by a yellow-red card (54e).
Bosnia had already failed the 2010 World Cup in South Africa in Portugal.
At the Stadium da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal had a well-measured departure.
Ronaldo sent a free shot of 30 meters in advance in the jersey.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed her distance shooting qualities and fired at a distance of 25 meters to make 2:0.
The Bosnians, who in the first half hour had not accomplished anything, had their first clear chance thanks to the attacker Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburger, the leader of the Manchester City English Championship, initiated a headball headed down the cross-bar, the ball did not cross the goal line (33rd).
Jiracek drew a goal for Czech
Finally referee Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding at the centre of all attention.
After an attack on Helder Postiga during the Bosnian penalty, Stark decided for Schwalbe and showed the yellow card in Portuguese (36th).
On the other hand, Stark granted a penalty of 11 meters played by the controversial hand after an action by Fabio Coentrao that Misimovic certainly diverged.
But after the break, Europe's 2004 vice champion succeeded four times and everything became clear.
For Czech, Petr Jiracek also ended the last doubts during the 81st minute.
For example, the 1976 European champion will go to EM for a fifth time.
Coach Michal Bilek's team with legionaries Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg) also had a chance and had to survive a moment of shock in the initial phase.
Goal Keeper Petr Cech has stopped with a reflex a last minute goal by Tomas Sivok potential (9e).
Montenegro had its greatest potential when the Duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic marked the 40th minute of the rotation on the repair surface right next to the Cech shot.
After the break, the crossing had to come to the help of the world-class guard of the Czechs who had already been killed, once again, the attacker of the FC Seoul had been replaced (50th).
The goal shortly before the end finally clarified everything.
Turkey missed Zagreb's football miracle during that time.
Four days after 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb were unable to go beyond 0:0.
While the national coach Guus Hidedink had also had to give up his seat on the 2002 EM third-party bank, the Croats were able to rejoice at their fourth round at the end of the European Championship.
In the presence of 31,000 spectators in Maksimir stadium, the Turks had almost caught a dream departure.
Selcuk Inan scored at the seventh minute with a long-range shot only the pole, attacker Kazim Kazim couldn't even bury the ball for the purpose.
After the moment of fear, Croatia has increasingly gained control.
Even after the break, the Croats didn't let anything burn.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic of Vfl Wolfsburg, who was replaced by Ivan Perisic of Dortmund at 62 e Minute, the Bundesliga Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) legionaries remained on the ground.
Trapatoni participates in EM
In Dublin, the Irish have been celebrating their first participation in EM since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward led the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already successfully taken over 4:0 the first step for a preliminary decision, 32nd Minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57e) equalized for visitors.
Ireland pushed at higher speed from the beginning, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, before Robbie Keane from Los Angeles Galaxy received the first good opportunity.
Only at the last moment that Estonia's defence has been able to prevent a possible purpose of the first buster.
In the 32nd minute, it happened.
After an unsuccessful defense by the goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward was at hand and will lock the ball on the line for 1:0.

Personal mass slaughter
Peter Englund's new book offers depth and generosity. It's entitled "The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War" (The Beauty and Grief: an intimate story of the First World War), it begins with a long list of characters that close your heart.
A tip to start with: tear this page carefully and make it your brand-page.
You will learn to know these people in detail. In this novel tale by Peter Englund, this list of characters will be your GPS, a beacon during these few moments where, like one of his men or women, you will be disturbed and desperate in the mists of war.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which issues the Nobel Prize in Literature.
He wrote here an unusual book which he accurately described as "an anti-history work."
It includes some known names, important treaties or famous battles; almost no ambassador or discussion on strategies and equipment is found.
It's not so much a book about what happened, he explains, that a "book describing what it could look like."There are "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods."
"Beauty and sorrow" summarizes the experiences in wartime of 20 more or less ordinary men and women, on both sides of the war, from young schoolchildren and botanists to escalators, passing by doctors, ambulances and sellers.
Some will become heroes.
Some of the prisoners of war will lose members, go crazy or lose their lives.
Their lives are wavering here like the candles of a church: while some are extinguished, new ones are lit up.
Peter Englund's book departs from traditional history books.
He denied the idea that the First World War was summed up only by the terrible trenches war on the western front.
"Beauty and sorrow" skillfully describes other war theatres: the Alps, the Balkans, the eastern front, Mesopotamia and East Africa.
The soldiers present in this book are under hives; a Christmas pass in Egypt under the pyramids; tsé-tsé flies are an intrusive problem.
This book is moving from the first page.
War invades the lives of these people as a natural disaster, such as a hurricane Katrina who possesses the corditous.
When guns hit far away, and if you're a mother at home, are you staying or running away?
Who's coming anyway?
Almost no one can understand what happened, not even the reasons for this war.
According to Peter Englund, "the lack of facts has been enhanced by assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"Beauty and sorrow" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, as well as Richard Stumpf, a young sailor in the German high seas fleet.
Their stories are mainly drawn from memories, letters and other documents already published.
The versions of their lives can be terrifying or exciting, but they are more preserved thanks to the accumulation of small moments and isolated details.
Most of them address deprivation and the ability to cope.
Telling the story of a German schoolgirl, Peter Englund writes: "Ersatz, everywhere ersatz."
"Coffee replacement, false aluminium, rubber imitation, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He continues on substitute food in Germany.
He describes "the meat made of cooked rice crushed in sheep's fat (and finished with a false bone of wood); tobacco made with dried roots and dried potato skin; soles of wooden shoes."
He claims that "837 authorised substitute meats are registered in sausage production and 511 substitute coffees are also found."
Some stories address honor and courage.
An American recognizes his own impulse towards the savagery and says about the war: "You feel that after all, that is what men were destined to do, rather than to sit in a comfortable chair, a cigarette and a whiskey by hand, reading a newspaper or a best-seller, and rather than claiming that such a varnish is synonymous with civilization, and that there is no barbarian behind your loaded and clouted shirt.
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he is at great risk of dying, and that no one will notice or pay attention to it.
"When we are reappointed to sacrifice ourselves, we hope to have an audience," he writes.
Unfortunately it's rather comparable to "a convicted man secretly strangled."
Other observations concern the decline of an old Europe and new types of terror.
"The conflict is increasingly becoming a history of economic competition," writes Peter Englund, "a war between factories."
He grasps the arrival of what he calls "a new species within the beast of the beginning of the century: the killer of a well articulated mass and ideologically convinced, in well-cut clothing, who executes his butchery while sitting behind a counter."
People act unexpectedly; we find as many basic behaviors as heroism.
Peter Englund talks about soldiers who have tried at all costs to catch a venereal disease from prostitutes in order to avoid service at the front.
"We find the most grotesque expression in the trade of pus due to gonorrhea, that soldiers buy and lay on genital organs in the hope of ending the hospital," he writes.
"The most desperate apply it to the eyes, which results in blindness to life."
In this translation of the Swedish by Peter Graves, the prose of Peter Englund is flexible but non-hostitatory, perfectly adapted to his task of humanity.
In dozens of short scenes, he grasps the way war has " triggered exclusively uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, aversion to religion."
People start to wonder why their leaders make them a war.
The best works dealing with World War I are often indirect, such as "Great War and Modern Memory" by Paul Fussel, or "Western Nothing New", by Erich Maria Note, rather than complete.
Peter Englund's work is an unconventional pantheon.
The end of the book is the most devastating thing I have read in a non-functional work.
I won't reveal it.
But it is as if he had emerged from his book, seized this page where the list of people appears and burned with a light.
After a first false step, a carefully planned operation
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some wearing riot helmets.
The night of Monday to Tuesday was chosen because Zuccotti Park would be the most empty.
The operation remained secret from all but a few high-ranking officers and others informed as soon as they were about to complete an exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the heart of the operation, highlighting the risks and challenges facing the Police Department.
There could be no repetitions of episodes in recent weeks, such as the use of pepper gas against demonstrators, who went against the department's regulation and caused a storm of public solidarity for protesters.
The operation to clean Zuccotti Park from its demonstrators was deployed after two weeks of planning and training.
Police officers had prepared themselves by observing the progress of occupations in other cities.
A capital exercise was organized on Randall Island for the operation at Zuccotti Park.
Police officers receive better training against riots - anti-terrorist measures that include the rapid movement of a large number of police officers - to focus on the Lower Manhattan neighborhood.
The last training session took place on Monday evening, on the side of Manhattan of the East River.
The orders given to move in the park reached "at the last minute," said a regular, referring to the operation as "a simple exercise".
"The few policemen I know and who were called didn't know they would go to Zuccotti Park," said the person anonymously.
"The only ones who knew they would go there are at the top of the police department's hierarchy."
The city was able to hold a lesson, hence the secret of the operation.
On 14 October, police officers wanted to clean the park but were pushed back by hundreds of demonstrators informed about the plans.
The Tuesday operation involved officers from various police units, including operational forces from around the neighborhood - dozens of officers used to particularly criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that many people were going and coming to the park during the day, in the way of migrants, so one hour in the morning was a good schedule.
"It was appropriate to proceed when the park had fewer people," he said.
Emergency services vehicles equipped with spots and speakers gathered on Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before intervening.
The lights and recorded messages from speakers seemed to intimidate the demonstrators.
As community affairs officers entered the park equipped with their clear blue winds, many demonstrators simply gathered their affairs and left.
No tents were touched before 1:45 p.m. told the police, which allowed the occupants time to gather their affairs.
Other teams of police officers were spotted on the perimeter, ready to intervene if arrests were necessary.
Journalists present inside the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the spokesperson for the Chief of the Police Department, stated that this measure was taken only by security.
But according to many journalists, the police would have prevented them from observing the intervention within the park, which was rudely retained by the officers.
Browne stated that the television camera trucks on Church Street along the west side of the park were able to capture images.
While the police were moving west across the thick business of the protesters, including luggage, plastic lawn and bags of leaves filled with clothing, teams in the sanitation department followed, cleaning up everything the occupants left behind.
The few demonstrators who refused to leave were dragged. The images were broadcast on the Internet shortly thereafter.
The main group of demonstrators took place near the camp kitchen, not far from the centre of the park.
Some have formed a barrier that the police have moved to stop methodically.
About ten people at the epicenter of the camp hung up together.
Finally, two people chained to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Emergency services were called to cut the chains.
No arrest took place in the park before 3:30 p.m. said Mr. Kelly.
According to the Police, the cleaning operation ended about an hour and a quarter later.
According to Mr. Browne, nearly 142 people were arrested in the park.
most for "problem to public order and rebellion".
Joseph J. Esposito, head of the Police Department, is the most senior officer to be found on the scene.
Phil T. Pulaski, the head of the detective department, was also present.
Mr. Kelly, although present, "did not direct the operations," said Mr. Browne.
A second group of police officers were waiting along the east side of the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, if necessary.
Barricadas were placed on Cortlandt Street, a block of houses north of the park, as well as on Pine Street, south.
We saw the Police expand the perimeter well beyond Zuccotti Park.
Several officers, most of them equipped with shields, have even been seen pushing people away.
About 28 people were on the north side.
One of the most vivid actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
Around 5:00 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protester jumped onto the top of a police car. Others were seen to be cracking the tires of a police truck.
At one point, a plywood came up flying from the crowd.
Finally, a police officer and a protestor were hospitalized.
The School Aid Union pursues the city for redundancy
The union, which represents hundreds of school aids that have lost their jobs last month, plans to bring a trial to the city on Wednesday for unnecessary and discriminatory dismissals. The impact is disproportionate on schools hosting disadvantaged schoolchildren.
The prosecutions are probably the ultimate weapon of the union, Council of the 37th District, to try to have the dismissals cancelled.
Six hundred and sixty-twelve school grants, parents' coordinators and other employees, who were among the least well-paid in the city, lost their jobs on October 7th. The union leaders compared these dismissals to political revenge for not leaving the city access to a health care fund led by groups of workers, which would have closed the budget gap last spring.
The municipal authorities categorically denied this accusation.
At a municipal council hearing last month, Chancellor Dennis Walcott stated that the dismissals were part of the budget closed in June.
One member of the Council replied, noting that school leave was not specified in the budget.
The 37th District Council officers stated that they would complete a notice of complaint warning the Department of Education that it would continue; a press conference will be held Wednesday to officially announce judicial proceedings to the Supreme Court of State of Manhattan.
Dennis M. Walcott and the city's education department will be the defendant. The complainants will be represented by eight workers who are fired, all black or Latin American, like most school aids who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesperson for the legal department of the city, said that the municipality had not yet been able to see the reasons for the trial and therefore cannot comment on the allegations.
According to a draft of complaints obtained by the New York Times, the union would put on the number of layoffs in the city's most disadvantaged schools to support its complaint against unfair treatment, stating that the poorest schools would lose the most aid due to regular under-financing.
While there are no layoffs on Staten Island, and just a few in Upper East Side or TriBeCa institutions, 17 school aids have lost their jobs in the 23rd Brownsville District, and 46 in the 8th and 9th Districts of the Southern Bronx Districts.
Noting the loss of five school grants out of eight employees at public school 36 in Harlem, where 68% of schoolchildren live in poverty, prosecutions state that "This is not an assisted parent's neighborhood that can bring funds to fill the budget gap."
The public school budget 36 was reduced by 3.26% this year. Funds were also lost when the city changed its calculation of additional funding for each less-favoured student registration.
The union also claims that school directors may have been misled by certain terms in a memorandum authorizing the dismissal of parents' coordinators.
The memo used the term "overrun" to describe the action, even though "overrun" more generally describes the action of moving a teacher from a school to a group of available workers whose wages are paid by the central office.
According to the draft complaints, "six sixty parents coordinators have been fired," and "not only because of excess."
Mission completed: Congress finds agreement on the question of Libya
Finally, it would appear that the Republicans and Democrats have reached agreement in the Chapter on the issue of lifting in Libya.
It will have taken a successful uprising, the capture and death of the long-standing dictator Muammar Kadhafi as well as American involvement.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will have to make a decision next Tuesday, supported by President John Kerry (Democrat - Massachusetts), with Senators John McCain (Republicain - Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent - Connecticut), applauding the Libyan people for their revolt and American troops for their "courage".
"This resolution is to honour the courage of the Libyans as they begin to rebuild their country," said John Kerry.
"It's bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations."
Language may be harmless, but the debate on Libya has never been simple so far.
During the summer, legislators from both parties came into conflict, as well as with the White House, on the formulation of several resolutions aimed at whether or not to approve the United States military role in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain submitted a resolution to authorize the limited use of American military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated by a broad bipartisan margin and was never voted in the Senate.
But on the same day of the failure of the bill, the House of Deputies also rejected a measure aimed at reducing the financing of US operations in Libya.
The U.S. mission therefore remained in the form of legislative purgatory - the Congress was opposed enough to criticize Obama's management of the mission, but not enough to cut off the grass under his foot.
The Congress's indecision was overcome by events.
Tripoli fell under the insurgents in August and Kadhafi was killed on 20 October.
NATO's mission ended officially on 31 October.
The Senate can now act.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Relations "congratulates the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and determination for freedom" and "congratulates the men and women of the American armed forces and their coalition partners engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people, for their fantastic courage and professionalism."
The resolution also states "the national interest of the United States in achieving an irreversible and successful transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure win the full support of the Senate Foreign Affairs Commission or divide legislators as last June?
The Senator and Chair of the Richard D. Lugar (Independent) Commission opposed the latest version.
His spokesman said last Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not yet read the latest version of a new project.
Within the Chapter, the House must vote this week on an amendment to the Constitution to obtain a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all the Republicans of Congress, and a few Democrats.
The measure, supported by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will constitute the first constitutional amendment on the budget, or any other matter, to obtain a floor vote in the House or in the Senate.
Other legislators have so far failed to approve their amendments, but this is not without trying.
The Goodlatte amendment is one of the 68 constitutional amendments to be tabled at Congress on a wide range of subjects.
Some are recurring - the same bill proposed in both the House and the Senate - and others are slightly different from a precedent.
There are at least 15 versions in the House only of the amendment for a balanced budget, and another handle that would "control federal spending".
Some of these bills are identical, but they give their support - in particular the new Republicans who wish to wish their CVs - the chance to boast of being "the author" of such a measure.
The Budget Control Act, which was approved last August, called for the vote of the House and the Senate on the amendment of a balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members wish to limit the number of mandates for which members of Congress can serve, while José E. Serrano (Democrat - New York) wishes to lift the limit of two mandates for presidents.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat - Illinois) proposed a multitude of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and health care, among other subjects.
An amendment prohibiting marriage between individuals of the same sex is perpetually proposed, as is the amendment prohibiting the desecration of the flag.
Some legislators also wish to authorize the cancellation of federal laws if two thirds of the States oppose it.
As eager as members have been to offer amendments, they are not as fast as in the past.
At the 111th Congress, the legislators proposed 77 amendments and introduced 66 at the 110th.
The trend slows down compared to the early 1990s when members generally proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, according to the figures provided by the Senate library.
But these amendments did not have much more success than they do today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 but proposed to Congress in 1789.
"Massacred but not beaten," says Gabrielle Giffords during his first television interview since the shooting.
Ten months after an armed man shot him at the end of Tucson, Representative Gabrielle Giffords (Democrat - Arizona) appeared on Monday evening in a television show, sang Broadway's Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow and said he wanted first to settle down instead of returning to Congress.
During his appearance in the television newspaper "20/20" on the ABC channel, next to Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords struggled to form sentences and needed help to walk.
The show approached his difficult return following the bullet that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of the brain, crossing the head.
Three months ago, she had made a surprising return to the House of Representatives to vote on the text on the debt ceiling.
During his first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six people and injured thirteen others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and qualified his recovery as "difficult".
After Diane Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gabrielle Giffords, 41 years old, answered "more well".
The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, took place at a special edition of "20/20", broadcast on the eve of the release of the new book of the couple entitled "Gabby: a story of courage and hope".
The special show has traced Gabrielle Giffords' recovery since the shooting on January 8.
In videos filmed by Mark Kelly in the first few weeks, it is seen on his hospital bed, his head shaved and a wide scar on his forehead.
She manages to use only one or two fingers, with her husband's encouragement.
A few months later, Gabrielle Giffords sits in a wheelchair while doctors teach him to perform simple actions.
A sign of the head.
A movement of the lips.
And finally, his first word, "What."
A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords whispered another word ("Toast") to ask for a change in the breakfast menu.
The videos broadcast by ABC show the important role of music in the restoration of Gabrielle Giffords: do we see the Representative singing with the doctors the air of Cyndi Lauper "Girls Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty "Free Fallin"?
During the interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who spends two hours every day with doctors, said he did not remember the shooting.
According to her husband, she was reading an article about the shooting on March 12 when she stopped her and asked for the first time about the six people killed during the incident.
The armed man, Jared Lee Loughner, is detained in a prison in Missouri and vigorously treated pending trial.
"There were many deaths," Gabrielle Giffords told Diane Sawyer.
"Dur, hard, hard."
During her recovery, Mark Kelly told Diane Sawyer, she said, "I was beaten."
"Then I'd say, "Gabby, you haven't been beaten," said Mark Kelly.
You've just been slaughtered.
And you're gonna get out of it, get yourself back and go back even harder than ever.
More pity than respect for troops
The event: a gala on Wall Street to harvest millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad on impotence, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines around him.
The crowd in tie-clothes stood at his feet to hail him.
"The military, men and women, are considered heroes," said David Saltzman, organizer of the spring fundraising.
A military high degree present at the gala, also attended by Admiral Mike Mullen, head of the U.S. Army Staff, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were presented as some kind of orphan," wrote the military high-grade in an electronic mail.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know.
But it wasn't respect, just pity.
The absolutely contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationships between the military and a passionate but often distant American audience.
Praises are given to the troops for their sacrifices.
But they have a certain price, they declare a few soldiers.
The public acts increasingly as if it was sorry for men and women in uniform.
"We are not at all victims," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who led the troops in Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan.
"But it would seem that the only way to support us is to lock us in the role of malicious spirits."
This is a very sensitive subject for military leaders, who do not wish to appear unrecognized or disagree with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger of the troops coming back from the Vietnam war has been much worse.
Thus, most of the conversations about pity take place in complete confidentiality among veterans.
After the return of his two sons from the battle with the Marines, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that the public would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with respect because they were faced with insurgents and traveled to distant lands.
Others would wonder if "an angry and violent veteran hides under the surface," said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to work in the Government in Washington.
When he sought a job, he said, he felt that some people who were passing the interviews asked him in a subtle way whether he would be able to hold the blow under the stress of a demanding job in Washington immediately after his return from the fight.
"When you discuss the subject of the service, you are faced with negative impressions," says Colonel Cancian when he speaks to his sons.
The difficulties of the military arise, in part, from the American indifference to wars.
Winnings are rarely congratulated by a country that is so unfamiliar with the army and that sees little direct benefits from wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation, we no longer value heroism in the same way as for World War II," said Lieutenant General Retired David Barno, who led the troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the congratulations of political men and the people focus largely on the depth of the suffering of a military.
Troops are recognized for the number of periods of service, the number of lost friends or the extent of injuries.
The Army Faces Growing Pressure Against Rape
This week, a capital hearing will decide whether 28 men and women will be prosecuted against the army for alleged inaction regarding rape.
If necessary, hundreds of complainants will prepare the next one.
The 1st-class soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and pregnant 11 weeks on the night she claimed to have been raped by a soldier.
It was in October 2008. She would return to her barracks at Miramar Air Station, in northern San Diego, after having dinner with a friend, when she met a colleague carrying a pack of beer.
He asked if he could join her in his room for a drink.
"It was an alarm signal," says Elizabeth Lyman.
But Texane put aside her concern.
I thought, no, he's 19.
"He's from Texas," she says.
"I should have followed my intuition."
A few minutes after entering Elizabeth Lyman's room, the man caught her from behind, thrown to the ground and raped, she claims.
This week, on November 18, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other military personnel, some still in service and others not, will await with anxiety the court ruling during a historic trial in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether a trial against former defence secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will take place.
They are accused of not having stopped the generalization of rape within the army, thus violating the constitutional rights of soldiers.
Classified in February by Susan Burke, a Washington lawyer, the trial initially involved 17 complainants. This number was 28 the following months - 25 women and 3 men, all pretending to have been raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers. They also claim that the army did not investigate, prosecute or provide adequate justice after the alleged attacks.
Susan Burke says he's taking it to the Gallon army, because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a vertical structure," she says.
"Who are the individuals in a position to eradicate the culture of reprisals?"
Counsel also states that since February, she has been contacted by nearly 400 other survivors, most of whom may be part of future judicial proceedings.
His strategy: instead of gathering all the complainants in this case - putting all his eggs in the same basket - it will attempt several trials, if necessary, to maintain pressure.
The Defence Team, led by U.S. attorney Neil MacBride, filed a motion to reject the case.
The judicial documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defence strategy, and essentially the fact that the army cannot be prosecuted by soldiers in service or not for injuries caused by the armed forces.
According to a 1950 Supreme Court decision, called Doctrine Feres, the Federal Government is not responsible for injuries suffered by active staff.
"The alleged evil is inherent in the military service of the complainants" indicate the documents.
The Department of Defence refused to comment.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women still do not officially have the right to go to combat, this distinction is written only on paper: the front lines of recent wars are rarely only male.
In Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of women soldiers play an increasingly important role, particularly in contacting local women.
As a result, of these two wars, 150 women soldiers lost their lives - two thirds in combat.
It's time for the army to modernize itself, says Susan Burke.
She is not alone in carrying out this fight: three other trials are ongoing in addition to hers.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Services Centre is preparing a case against the four main military academies for having been said to encourage a misogynistic atmosphere.
On the other hand, the non-profit foundation Vietnam Veterans of America is preparing a trial against the army, focusing on the diagnosis of "personal disturbances" attributed to victims of rape in order to give them leave - a relatively ordinary fact, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwaru of the Women's Action Network (the Women's Action Network), a human rights group.
His group tried a trial in December at the Veterans Administration, accusing them of discriminatory practices in dealing with claims for benefits for persons claiming to have been victims of sexual assault in the service.
Nine independent bills were presented to Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing various solutions.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual assaults were recorded from the Department of Defence's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office).
But it is well known that the number of sexual assaults is underestimated. Indeed, according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this figure represents about 13.5% of the 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The report also examines the percentage of prosecutions in March: in 2010, 20% of cases recorded in the military were prosecuted - half of the percentage of the civil justice system.
Complainants in Susan Burke's case describe their aggression as the first in a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, she informed the military police about rape less than an hour after the facts.
That night, she said, she was asked to report her rape to several police officers, doctors and commanders 11 times in detail.
She suffered a "rape kit" (literally a rape kit), and her attacker's blood - due to a cut to her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman sat before a judge at a trial during which she was questioned about her sexual relations with her boyfriend earlier on the day of her assault.
Six people testified as witnesses of morality for the perpetrator, who ended up acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was rendered," says Elizabeth Lyman.
"I thought I was gonna start getting contracts, and I started screaming after the court."
"I was placed in psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remembered telling my commander, "This was not his trial but mine."
Elizabeth Lyman was forced to consult a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder, making her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was sent back under less than honorable terms, preventing her from receiving any advantage.
Whether or not the Lyman case and other complainants will move forward is a long story, says John Turley, Law Professor at the University of Washington College of Law.
However, he noted, "In my opinion, they should be able to move forward."
Only this doctrine criticized since its introduction lies between them and a verdict.
I've always criticized the Feres doctrine.
The army is decades behind because it does not have the same advantages and dissuasive means of liability.
"The odds are heavy against them... but it's important that they try," he adds.
These things only change when the good ones have the will to fight.
If the trial is not in their favor, Susan Burke, the complainant's lawyer, will gather his hundreds of other complainants for further trials.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue as long as there is no reform," she said.
Where until we die, either of the two options.
The walls have eyes: researchers study you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was a simple guy sharing his anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who acknowledged that he had been taken from a murderous madness in Norway in July leaving 77 victims, was faced with his first trial.
While Breivik acted alone, he was far from being on cyberspace: he had spent much of the time before the attack on his computer, discussing with some of the millions of nationalists who support extreme right groups on social media sites.
After this summer's tragedy, researchers want to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy... connect to Facebook.
"We realized that it wasn't so difficult to find them," says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recent report published by DEMOS's think tank on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook is filled with so much personal information, says Jamie Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the site's advertising tool to find the people they've been looking for with scientific precision - the way marketers have been doing it for years.
Jamie Bartlett's team found that half a million members are fans of extreme right-wing groups in Europe. It targeted them with ads, but instead of linking them to a new group or product, the ads invited users to respond to an inquiry. The questions were about their level of education, attitudes to violence and their optimism about their own future.
By contacting these people via Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview 10,000 supporters of 14 extreme right parties in 11 European countries - without leaving the office.
"It's a new way to do research," says Jamie Bartlett.
Some results are not surprising at all: the online supporters of the right-wing groups are rather men, young people and against immigration.
But surprisingly, "those who associate online and offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screen."
DEMOS' study is just one example of how Facebook has become the new indispensable tool in the hands of scientists.
Reflection groups, medical researchers and polytologists use the site to study all subjects that affect health issues such as social trends, thanks to "I like", publications on walls and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users that add on average three content per day, the "data supernova" generates an explosion in research, increasing the number of research works whose name of the site appears in the title by almost 800% compared to the last five years.
For some researchers, the advantage of Facebook lies in the fact that it allows you to study people that you could not approach in the street.
"Before, when you tried to investigate people from the British national party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You should have gone to the party, but they would never have allowed you to come in," says Jamie Bartlett.
"Facebook avoids all this - you have direct access to their information."
Others say that the site could offer a way to identify and address health and social problems.
According to a recent study by Mr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and his colleagues, young students talking on Facebook about their drunken exploits had a lot more chance of being alcoholic than discreet students in this regard.
Megan Moreno suggests that students' colleagues, such as advisors, could monitor the site and intervene to possibly help a student whose status would talk too often about alcohol.
"You can't handle a problem if you don't diagnose it," says Dmitri Christakis, co-author of Megan Moreno and director of the Centre for Health, Behaviour and Development of Children at the Institute of Children's Research located in Seattle, Washington Post.
"We know how to identify children at risk, and who would not otherwise be recognized."
Facebook also consistently accesses the information of its users.
The website's data team has studied statistics on the situation of love and Valentine's Day, the participation rate in the 2010 mid-term elections and a national happiness index (thanks to information only available - digital freedom champions have long argued that the site could make available its data treasure to other people for research purposes).
But Facebook users know that the site observes them, whether they like it or not - in exchange for being able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of kilometers away, the site is allowed to access your information.
But what happens when Facebook users are part of an investigation they haven't even heard of?
While researchers have well-defined instructions on how to collect information other than through the Internet, there is anything else online.
"I don't think a lot of users have already thought about the fact that a researcher can study their profile," says Neil Selwyn, sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, based on a 2006 study he conducted by observing the Facebook walls of his students.
"As long as they knew, the exchanges were seen only by their friends."
Then comes the question of methodology.
Even without going over the Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know the degree of truth of a profile or on a user's wall.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do in reality are two completely different things," says Neil Selwyn.
This is why, despite his experience as a technological researcher, Neil Selwyn believes that a notepad and pen remain the best tools to use.
"Nothing can replace the real world and contact with people," he said.
"Social studies are supposed to address the social aspect - and social, it's not in front of a computer."
"Froid and Inhuman": first appearance of Anders Behring Breivik
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who admitted to organizing the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance fighter" during his first appearance at the trial in Oslo.
"I am a military commander of the Norwegian Resistance Movement and the Norwegian Templars," he said in front of a courtroom filled with 500 people.
"As far as the jurisdiction of the court is concerned, I apologize for your mandate as organizations supporting an ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the facts but I do not plead guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "did not want to leave him the opportunity to use this trial to express his views."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who brought with him a paper speech, to speak to the parents of the victims at the end of the hearing.
Judge Nesheim also asked the police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, prohibited him from speaking to the media for four weeks and warned him that the authorities would closely monitor all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
Some 30 parents of survivors and victims were present at the hearing.
Some came hoping to look Breivik in the eyes, others to be sure that he would be placed behind bars.
All participated in the hearing with a view to seeing the end of the trial.
"I found him cold and inhuman," said a survivor of Utoya to the Norwegian television channel NRK.
"I wasn't comfortable, but I personally got a little advanced after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Dressed in a dark suit and a blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the trial. He watched journalists and survivors in his eyes as he entered and left the court.
Despite the strange idea that Breivik belongs to a vast movement of "resistance", the judge determined that he was not crazy. He also stated that there is no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
The attacks of July 22 appear to be the work of an extremist rather than a whole group of radicals, which may help some.
But this does not reduce the sadness or confusion felt by the entire nation.
"I would have preferred him to look like a monster, but that's not the case," said a victim's relative.
"That would have been much easier."
7 lessons from Steve Jobs' lost interview at the cinema this week
After Steve Jobs died on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford - distinguished by the technical engineering and inventor of modern computing.
But what Apple fans can find more revealing in a recent Steve Jobs interview that will be broadcast this week in the first part of a film on the main markets is how much this creative spirit had understood the processes and workflows of the products.
He was undoubtedly a creator and a dreamer. He identified himself as a hippie but was also very meticulous and organized, as well as an organogram enhancer - a man who believed that many business leaders suffered from a "disease letting them think that a great idea makes 90% of the work... [but] a considerable amount of manual work separates a brilliant idea from an exception product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triph of the Nerds". This series traces the computer's birth, and he sits for more than an hour with Steve Jobs for a long and rare conversation.
At that time, Steve Jobs had been leaving Apple for about 10 years. He was already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, aimed at popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small portion of the interview with Crengely is used in Nerds, he states that the main copies have disappeared in the transport.
It was only after Steve Jobs died that a full video was found in the director's garage.
This video, slightly uploaded, is the basis of the 68-minute film entitled Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will be broadcast at the film on Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who knows to hate in-depth interviews, Steve Jobs seems here surprisingly enthusiastic about exhibiting technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly attentive.
On four different points during the interview, the answers come a long time after the questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, during which Steve Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts, in order to provide a precise answer.
There are also moments when Steve Jobs' perfectionism resurfaces, where he seems to be eager to hear Cringely's questions, giving him elbows to speed it up and move on to more important questions or topics.
Filmed before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, we find a strangely present aspect on Lost Interview. Steve Jobs evaluates what he considers good or bad in other companies and shares his own vision on the future of computing.
It's one thing to read the posthumous evaluations of Steve Jobs' career, but there's something gross and inspiring about the man we see here, the anxious dreamer on the eve of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can be and must be.
He explains them and then implements them.
Here is a quick summary of seven remarkable sequences of Lost Interview:
On how he learned how to run a business:
"During all these years, I have always asked: 'Why do you do things?' and the answers are constantly the same: 'oh, just because you have to do them.'"
No one knows why, no one thinks deeply about things in a business.
That's what I found out.
Steve Jobs continues by providing details of his efforts to simplify accounting at Apple.
Curious about how the costs were recorded - we often start with a "standard cost" assessed for nose, then adjusted with a "variation" - it developed an automated factory that guaranteed the precise calculation of the commercial costs.
On the opportunity to play a tour of the Pope:
Steve Jobs tells the anecdote of the "Blue Box" he created with Steve Wozniak - a device that was used to hack telephone networks and telephone free of charge in long-distance.
The device has been the subject of many writings before, but the euphoria of Steve Jobs here in his description of the Blue Box as an act of appropriation is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box by using a public phone, calling and then connecting from one AT&T network to another while bypassing as many satellites as possible.
"We wrapped the ball of different things a half-dozen times and you screamed on the public phone and it happened to you a minute later on the public phone next door," says Jobs laughing.
"We were young and thanks to this Blue Box, we learned that we could create something ourselves capable of controlling billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
We didn't both know much, but we invented a little thing capable of controlling great things. It was an incredible lesson, and I don't think Apple would ever have existed without it.
Steve Jobs continues by recounting a wonderful tour that he and Wozniak have developed: he telephoned the Vatican with the Blue Box in the middle of the night by making himself pass for Henry Kissinger and asked to speak to the Pope.
While several members of the Catholic hierarchy are summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two accomplices go madly laughing just before the Pope himself wakes up.
On his love with technology (and walking by Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12 years old, hunting for spare parts to make a frequency meter, he looked for Bill Hewlett's number in the yearbook and gave him a wire shot.
Shortly after their 20-minute conversation, Steve Jobs gets a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"It had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only company I had seen at that age and it formed my definition of a company and the way employees were treated."
Steve Jobs later became one of HP's employees to visit the company's research laboratories, located in Palo Alto, where he discovered the "first office computer ever designed."
He was as big as a suitcase, he had a small cathode tube, and I fell in love with him.
The teenager I was back at HP and started writing programs for this machine.
On the improvisation of innovation:
At several moments in the interview, Steve Jobs talks about inventing new products on a head shot.
At the beginning of his career, while he settled down to sell some printed circuit cards, a customer asked him to assemble a complete computer.
Working only 30 days of credit, he must take care of the assembly as well as the delivery of finished devices.
Later, in Apple, he remembers the difficulties encountered in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember some big fights... we used to yell at me claiming it would take me five years [to make a mouse that would cost $300]. I had enough, I went out and went to see a designer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could manufacture for $15, which was incredibly reliable.
On major companies that are blowing up:
Long before he revived Apple, Steve Jobs had anticipated how many industrial leaders would cheat and lose control of their market share.
"Let's say that you worked at IBM or Xerox, you make a better copyist or a better printer, and then?"
You have the monopoly of the market, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing can evolve, so [these types of people] end up leading businesses and specialized product personnel are excluded from decision making.
Product engineering that has led to this monopoly position is completely rotten by people who cannot imagine designing a good product compared to a bad product - the required manual work.
That's what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
She could have done her current size ten times. Xerox would have been the Microsoft of the 1990s...
They took the defeat to victory.
On innovation as an artistic form:
"A huge part of manual work separates a great idea from an exceptional product... as you develop this idea, it changes and grows."
You learn a lot about its subtleties.
There are compromises... some things you can't do, electrons can do, glass, robots, factories too.
You must keep thousands of things in mind (these concepts) by putting them together to each other.
Finally, decisions are made by personal taste. It is about trying to expose you to the best products men have created, and trying to bring these things to the product you create.
Picasso once said that good artists copy and that great artists fly.
We are always ashamed to steal excellent ideas.
This is partly what makes Macintosh exceptional. The people who worked on it were musicians, poets, zoologists, historians, who just proved themselves the best IT scientists in the world.
If it were not for computer science, they would have done extraordinary things in another area.
Scalia and Thomas have dinner with opponents of health law while the court meets
On the day when the Supreme Court meets in private to examine the question of political disagreement, namely whether opposition to President Obama's law on health will be heard, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were noticed at a dinner sponsored by the law firm of lawyers who will defend the case before the high court.
The event was held last Thursday, when the nine judges met for a conference to discuss petitions for consideration.
One of the cases in question concerned a trial by 26 States challenging the reform of ambitious health care voted by Congress last year, a law that was a rallying point for conservative activists at the national level.
The judges agreed to hear the complaint, indeed, a monumental argument of 5h30 is expected next March, and the outcome will probably be in a position to foster the destabilization of the 2012 presidential race, which will be in full swing at the time of the court's decision.
The lawyer who will be held before the court and will argue for the rejection of the law will likely be Paul Clement, who served as the U.S. general solicitor during the administration of George W. Bush.
Clement's legal firm PLLC Bancroft was one of the two dozen firms that helped sponsor the annual Federalist Society dinner, a long-standing group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another promoter was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, which presents a huge financial challenge in the outcome of the dispute.
Dinner was held at a Washington hotel a few hours after the court conference on the case.
Among them was Mitch McConnell, the Senate's top Republican and stated opponent of the Health Act.
The guests star at dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is not new: the two judges have been present at the events of the Federalist Society for years.
And there's nothing against the rules of ethics.
In fact, judges are exempt from code of conduct that governs the actions of federal judges.
If they were, they would probably argue by the Canon 4C code, which states: "A judge may assist in collecting funds from legal and other organizations although the judge cannot be an intervener, an honorary guest, or on the program of such an event".
Nevertheless, the mere presence of Scalia and Thomas near two of the lawyers' offices in the case, as well as a firm with a massive financial interest, has sufficed to alarm government ethics activists.
"This violation of ethics and superb indifference to the code contradicts the statements of several judges that the Court complies with the same rules as all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of Common Cause.
"The judges drank and ate and collected gala funds with lawyers who had cases before the court."
Their presence and their participation in fund-raising of this event disassemblys any claim of impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little respect for critics claiming that they too easily mix court affairs with the agenda of groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife, Ginni, is a conservative high profile activist.
On the other hand, conservatives claim that Judge Elena Kagan has a problem with ethics, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a general solicitor of the administration of Obama when the first opposition to the law was brought to the court of first instance.
His criticisms urged Kagan to refuse to hear the case, saying that she had been too involved in defending the law to be impartial.
Kagan gave no indication she would.
Boeing records a record order of $18 billion for liners
The Emirates airline orders 50 Boeing 777, two-way aircraft, with the possibility to buy 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamlines in Oman Air, an estimated $1 billion market.
There is nothing extraordinary that a company receives an order covering 50 of its products.
On the other hand, it is quite a case when the company in question is the Boeing aircraft manufacturer and the amount of these 50 aircraft reaches the record amount of $18 billion.
It's just as incredible from whom Boeing received this order: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In forecasts published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines in the Middle East will need $2,520 aircraft worth a total of $450 billion in the next 20 years.
During the weekend, Boeing informed of the most expensive commercial aircraft order in its history - 50 Boeing 777 bi-courses.
The Dubai-based Emirates airline passed this pharaonic order.
Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Air Show that the airline is also likely to purchase 20 more aircraft, which would raise the total order amount to $26 billion.
On the other hand, Boeing stated on Monday that Oman Air commissioned six Boeing 787-8, named Dreamliners, a model that boasts important fuel and convenience savings for passengers.
The amount of these six devices amounts to more than $1 billion.
"It's clearly very positive for Boeing," said Morningstar analyst Neal Dihora.
"These customers in particular have enormous value."
In the Middle East, oil-producing countries own many of their airlines.
They therefore not only have the means to pay these planes, but an increase in fuel prices - usually detrimental to airlines because it represents their most important costs - would not be so damaging to them as the country would earn money with the rise in oil prices.
This is an important point because these companies will be less likely than others to cancel or defer their aircraft orders when oil prices increase, said Dihora.
"They have a natural risk cover," he said.
Emirates' command reinforces Boeing's predominance on the wholesale aircraft market and helps to curb the airbus competitor's attempt to impede with its A350 aircraft.
Boeing's victory at the aircraft show comes four months after Airbus' announcement to postpone the beginnings of the largest version of the A350, which competes directly with the Boeing 777-300ER.
Airbus rejects its beginnings to increase its growth as a result of its customers' demand to increase its capacity and autonomy.
Boeing's shares increased by 1.5% to $67.94.
The sister of the Mexican President manifestly beaten in the elections of Michoacán
Luisa Maria Calderon states that drug traffickers have helped their rival Fausto Vallejo from PRI in the race to the position of governor.
President Felipe Calderon's sister seems to have lost her attempt to gain access to Michoacán's governorship during violent elections, and she said Monday that drug traffickers have favored one of her opponents.
The first results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was in charge of the race as governor of that Western State.
"The intervention of the crime organized throughout the voting process and in particular yesterday is an alarming fact, not only for Michoacán but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon on the radio during an interview on Monday following the elections.
"They threatened our candidates, our electoral agents... they took seats, set up roadblocks... and forced people to vote" for the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seventy years until it lost its presidency in 2000.
But he organizes his return, and a victory in Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have noticed only a few Calderon, who was in charge of the polls before election day.
Calderon, a candidate of his brother's Conservative Party, the National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, left-wing candidate of the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who is currently serving as governor, has arrived third, a painful defeat before the 2012 Presidentials for this divided and unhappy left.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the first results.
Vallejo, former mayor of Morelia, the capital of the state, has denied any link with drug traffickers and has strongly advised other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specialized in the trafficking of marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine.
It is the State of origin of President Calderon, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive against traffickers in December 2006.
Yet, violence persisted.
A week before the elections, a PAN mayor was murdered while campaigning for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates gave up the campaign locally for fear.
However, for the PRI, as corrupt as the elections of Michoacán seem, a victory will help the party in its momentum.
The man expected to represent PRI in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory is very encouraging for next year."
BASD strongly encourages Asia to help the euro area
The Asian Development Bank called on India and China to prepare to help the euro area get out of the sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term decline that would prevent the development of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, the CEO of the BASD based in Manila, stated that the two economic powers to the fastest growth in the world had to "do everything in their power" to accelerate the recovery of the monetary area through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He advised the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, China) to look at Europe's difficulties of an "apathetic eye" and noted that Asian financial support alongside Europe's leaders and resources would prevent a long-term collapse of the world economy.
"We're all in this crisis together."
"Therefore anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia can be protected up to a certain point, but it's not safe."
"So if China and India can help, nothing will stop them."
In recent months, the euro area has been seriously shaken by a sovereign debt crisis.
Recently, the cost of Italian borrowing has been dangerously increased and the Prime Ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The booming sovereign debt crisis in Europe has caused fear that the world economy will return to recession, and has prompted major emerging economies to gather to help the euro area find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that the IMF would deliver all Asian aid, but he also stated that bilateral assistance - such as buying the US financial rescue fund obligations, the European Financial Stability Fund - provided greater negotiating power to Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, the Indian Minister of Trade and Industry, said that "India will do everything it can" to help the euro area as its own economy now suffers from a decline in exports and a rise in foreign capital arrivals.
"No one wants the euro area to remain unstable and agitated," he said.
"We have monumental challenges to face and we need to maintain a high level of growth."
"This is not a choice, it is an imperative, because where would we find work for the tens of millions of our young men and women?"
Others argue that developing economies such as India should not help rich Europeans while facing their own major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at Brown University in the United States, stated that it would be politically very difficult to accept aid from the 1.2 billion Indians, of whom at least 800,000 live with $2 a day or less.
"One day, they will discover that the Greeks retire at 50 years of age and leave on vacation in the sun and they will have trouble swallowing it," he said.
Lee Howell, President of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India's reserves should be used to maintain many well-paid Greek officials in poorly managed jobs that generate losses, as in the rail sector.
Mr Nag said that the euro area crisis could cause "significant impacts" across Asia.
The BASD forecasts of 7.5% economic growth in Asia in 2011/2012 are now facing "risks of loss" due to the European threat.
He noted that vulnerable emerging markets needed to develop "relief plans" to protect themselves from economic reversal and major capital leaks.
Strong Warnings from the Pentagon on Potential Reductions of Defence
The Secretary of Defence Leon Panetta put pressure on Congress on Monday, warning that the imminent automatic budget cuts would undermine national security and triggered a financial chain reaction of the Pentagon corridors to Afghanistan's battlefields, through civilian gatherings.
The Pentagon already digests $450 billion of reductions for the next decade, but now fears that an additional amount of $600 or more of cuts will be imminent if the Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
"The impact of these reductions would be devastating for the department," Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
He stated that the failure of Congress to reach a resulting budgetary agreement in what is called kidnapping would result in 23% reductions as well as the freezing of many new projects.
"An equally important reduction, applied without discernment, would make most of our ships and construction projects ineffective - you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously harm other efforts to modernize," Panetta wrote to senators.
"We would also be forced to separate ourselves from a number of our civilian staff and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we should almost certainly send civilians on leave without pay in order to achieve the goal."
"These changes would shake the faith of those who support our military and seriously damage our preparation."
Reductions would possibly affect combatants, continues Panetta.
"Although the financing of foreign contingency accounts at war is not directly affected by kidnapping, war efforts would be negatively affected by serious disruptions in the core budgets," Panetta warned.
"Contracting staff would be reduced, resulting in delays in contracts and the supervision of contracts that support war."
"The staff managing wages would be reduced, resulting in delays in payment to war vendors, and legal and political support would be disrupted."
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days earlier, asking for details on the potential impact of automatic compressions on the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequence of kidnapping on the Department of Defence would have triggered a rapid decline in the United States as an undisputed world leader of military power."
"We are fiercely opposed to this draconian action," senators said in a joint communiqué Monday afternoon when Panetta's letter was published.
"It is not a consequence that we can live with, and it is certainly not the consequence that we should impose ourselves."
"Sequestration is a threat to U.S. national security interests, and it should not have to happen."
That Panetta's letter and recent warnings from senators increase pressure for a budgetary compromise or a call to exempt the Pentagon from reductions remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly virulent about possible compressions, even though he himself reached the highest position in the Pentagon, which accumulated years of budget expertise at Congress and the White House and knowing that he was faced with difficult choices.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defence painted a dark picture of what might happen - a soldier with a shell, but no nucleus.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a bulletless brigade."
"It's a fighter plane, without enough trained pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs that don't have enough trained soldiers capable of carrying out the mission," Panetta said in her preliminary remarks to the Pentagon.
"It is a depressed force, ill-prepared and incapable of dealing with potential opponents."
"In fact, she invites aggression."
In an addendum to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta specifically stated how further reductions could " generate significant operational risks: time to respond to crises, conflicts and disasters; severe limits to our ability to deploy and engage in the world; and assumed unacceptable risk in future combat operations".
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defence projects could go to the coupe, including those already tested and some just at the early stages of planning.
This list included the Fighter F35 Joint Strike, a planned new bomber, the new generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal combat vessel and the new field vehicle, which would replace the Humvee of the army and the Navy.
Ending the development and testing of the F35 could generate $80 billion of savings over 10 years, but its supporters say it is an essential step in improving and responding to potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to detect a lie
A look at recent headlines indicates how widespread deception and lying are in everyday life.
The Republican candidate for the Herman Cain presidency is busy exchanging allegations of sexual harassment with several women; each side accusing the other of lying.
Penn State administrators were accused of berthing for allegedly covering reports that a retired football coach sexually assaulted boys.
Last week French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught by an open microphone stating to U.S. President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
The lie destroyed careers and convulsed countries.
The Congressman of New York and Internet celebrity Anthony Weiner went on for an idiot by quickly issuing statements contradicted by irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards was accused of violations of funding campaigns related to the coverage of an extramarital liaison.
And then, none of the people who have lived history will ever forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton triggered by mentioning in his second term about his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.
The stories of cheating at school and university tests are legion.
There have been instances where teachers gave the test responses to the students in order to get a good look at their performance assessments.
Mentors who should teach otherwise send the message that lying and deception are acceptable.
How many tricks do we meet?
On a given day, studies show that you can hear from 10 to 200 lies.
In fact, many of these are pious lies.
Another study showed that foreigners lie three times in the first 10 minutes of their encounter.
Detecting or detecting lies is an essential competence that each must acquire, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a game of society similar to, let's say, charades, where the goal is to write: "I've got you", the detection of deception is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades in prestigious universities that have conducted a thorough research of such projects, including psychology and physiology.
One of the research results is that the oldest myths on lying have been demystified.
The liars look you in the eye.
They don't shake, red, or they don't always matter.
Do not conclude that liars are difficult to detect and difficult to detect.
A qualified lie detector can discover the truth by examining the structure of the statement, facial micro-expressions, the formation of the question and the time of answer.
I have spent several years examining scientific results in the vast body and always emerging from knowledge about deception, and it is clear that the detection of deception is a modern competence that is easy to learn and useful to navigate in our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviews, negotiation or management.
The good liars are able to read well others, putting them at ease, managing their own emotions and intuitively detecting how others perceive them.
We know from research that extraverts lie more than introverts, than men say more lies "focused on them" while women say more lies "focused on others" - usually to protect someone's feelings - that married people lie less often to their partners than to unmarried people (but than the lies they tell tend to be enormous).
We also know that if you are perceived as a disbelieving, others will feel less guilty of lying to you.
How can you tell if someone's lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of your subject.
That's what we call "setting the benchmark data".
This helps to provide a benchmark to measure subsequent changes.
Watch the posture of your subject, laugh, voice quality.
You need to know if someone normally removes his feet permanently so as not to make unfair accusations when you see him tow his feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for clues of verbal and nonverbal misleading behaviors.
Consider these signs as red flags, not evidence of deception.
Deceitful people can immobilize the top of the body when they try to remember their history, they can point their feet towards the door, lean towards a exit, change posture significantly or present a relief of "post-interview" - a exaggerated sigh of relief, a change of posture when all difficult questions have passed.
The interviewers often falsely indicate that the interview is completed just to try to trigger the post-interview reaction.
Also, be careful about your subject vocabulary.
The famous Scott Peterson took off using the past while claiming that his murdered wife was alive, triggering a national search to find her.
Deceptional individuals can also use a remote language: "I have not had sexual relations with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or repeat completely a difficult question.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "wood tongue" in his answer to a difficult question: "Well... to say the truth... if I remember well... to my knowledge."
This makes the response perceptual rather than factual and is often a red flag.
There is no magic formula for the detection of lies, but the development of skills to recognize deception is possible.
These skills will improve the chances for anyone to avoid victimization by abusers in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial pipeline plan will be defeated after the US late approval threat
A few days after Obama's administration threatened to delay approval of an oil pipeline project between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico - provoking the anger of trade unions while calming environmentalists - the company seeking to build the pipeline said it was ready to redirect the project to the rails.
TransCanada stated Monday night that it will move the pipeline projected out of the ecologically sensitive area of the Nebraska dunes, and is confident that the project will still gain its approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada's official Alex Pourbax claims that the company remains confident that it will eventually obtain approval from an oil pipeline, but with a different route.
This follows the announcement by the State Department last week that it would delay its decision to grant a federal permit for the project until it receives further studies of potential itineraries to avoid the areas of the dunes of Nebraska and Ogallala aquifer, from vast groundwater sources.
"It's a real way forward," says Lee Terry, a Nebraska Republican at Fox News.
The new environmental review commissioned by the State Department would have probably pushed any decision until 2013, after the next year's elections, although staff members denied the involvement of policy in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the decision of the State Department, and expressed his support for it.
The 2,735 km pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
He would transport 70,000 barrels a day from Alberta province to Texas refineries.
To do so, he would need to cross six States.
It is hated by environmentalists, but loved by working groups, which have put over the estimated 20,000 oil-related jobs.
But the Nebraska legislators opposed this plan pressure that a law to force the removal of the Sand Hills region and the Ogallala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
While the ongoing environmental impact study of the Department of State found that the project would only pose limited negative environmental impacts, the energy industry stated that the Department's Inspector General ordered a separate survey of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is that a lobbyist engaged by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a campaign advisor to Hilary Clinton in 2008, would represent a conflict of interest to the program.
The other is whether a company that was hired to conduct the initial study was an inappropriate choice of its relationship with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle prosecuted for allegedly causing a young child to throw up in fear
A New York family claims that the diva Disco Patti LaBelle launched in the hall of their Manhattan building violence, terrorized their little girl to the point where she threw up her fear.
The tirade of the singer "Lady Marmalade" frightened the 18-month-old Geneviève Monk, so much so that she suffered " personality changes, sleep disorders" and "increased fear of strangers," says her family during the trial of the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
It was November 10, last year, while stage technician Kevin Monk, his kindergarten teacher's wife, Roseanna, and Geneviève were preparing to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was going to pick up the car, Roseanna Monk went down in the hall of their Riverside boulevard building with their luggage, carrying Geneviève in her arms.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped by the door and put her daughter for a moment.
"Someone came after me and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said "yes" and I went looking for her," she said.
LaBelle angrily warned the pregnant woman.
"She told me of an aggressive tone: "You shouldn't leave your daughter near the door," says Roseanna Monk.
"I said, "What you say or think I don't care."
She became angry and began to use jurors - the word "" and the word "" of a loud voice...
She had a bottle of water and started to sprinkle water from the bottle.
She said that at this point, Geneviève became hysterical.
"I said to this woman, "Look what you did to my daughter," says the mother of the child.
LaBelle threw herself on the mother - who always held Geneviève in her arms - and had to be held by her surrounding that led her to a car that was waiting for them, says Roseanna Monk.
The little girl cried so loud that she got sick, she added.
Later, the family sent a note asking for LaBelle's apology, but did not get any answers.
The lawyer and LaBelle representatives did not return our calls to comment.
The complaint claims for unspecified damages, but family lawyer Sam Davis stated that he took the case for free and that the family plans to donate all the money received to a charity work against cancer for children.
"The aim is to hold Patti LaBelle responsible for his conduct," said Davis.
"This kind of behaviour is totally unacceptable, especially to a mother's teacher with an 18-month-old child."
Climate adversity has halted the economy
During the first year of management of Mario López Valdez, in Sinaloa unemployment and informality increased, foreign investment decreased and the economy contracted
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of Government of Mario López Valdez, self-called change, which has generated great expectations regarding the advances of the economy, but given the climate adversity of the beginning of the year, the increase is not observed, in exchange there is a deterioration of the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures of February, apart from causing billion losses for the agricultural sector, have limited the possibilities of the state economy for growth, caused a decrease in economic activity in general by 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, mainly justified by the historical fall of 31.16 per cent in agriculture, which has affected the dynamism of other economic sectors.
According to the report on the allocations by the frosts of the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, there were damage of 582 million 835 hectares cultivated, of which 78.03 per cent suffered total damage and the remainder of 21.07 per cent suffered partial damage, the main crops affected were vegetables, maize and chickpeas.
The decline in economic activity has led to a steady increase in state unemployment, according to the National Institute for Statistics and Geography in the first three quarters of the year, as the rate of State unemployment in the first three quarters of the year has increased rapidly, since from January to March 55 thousand,053 signalers were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 per cent of the Active Economic Population, in the second quarter the rate has become 5.28 per cent and from July to September the average has continued to rise to 6.19 per cent, a rate representing more than 74 thousand unemployed signals, an increase compared to the first half of 18 thousand,969.
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, according to economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly on the basis of actions carried out by public policy.
"What is observed is an increase in unemployment which is due to various factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market due to a restriction of resources by the legislation approved in Congress to combat money-laundering, because for people who earn dollars illegally it is not easy for them to work to earn, invest and use them in something," he said.
Detained migration
López Cervantes reported that the rise in unemployment is also due to a demographic factor.
"The number of people leaving the state to go to work abroad has been restricted in the United States, first of all because of the difficulties of entry and secondly because they already have a lot of difficulty finding work, these people remain here and demand employment, which causes unemployment to rise," he said.
Lack of seriousness
The analysis of the signal labour market is worsening in view of the high level of lack of seriousness that predominates among the working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the population employed in this state is working there without contributing as a worker to any social insurance institution.
Apart from unemployment and lack of seriousness, another reason for disengagement for the state is low wages, the entity has lower wages in the country, according to the registers of the Mexican Institute of Social Insurance and the Secretariat of Labour and Social Forecast.
The average monthly income of signal workers was, until September, 5 thousand 352 pesos, much lower than the national average, which is 7 thousand 375 pesos.
FDI contraction
In addition to the decline in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, in 2011, the largest reduction in Foreign Direct Investment over the past 10 years was recorded, according to the Secretariat of Economy from January to June, the State FDI reached $630 thousand,697, representing a decrease of 87.74 per cent compared to the $5,143 thousand,312 recorded in the same period of the previous year.
In turn, the Economic Development Secretariat of the Government of the State accounts for a total investment of 17,280 billion pesos per year, recorded mainly by the tertiary sector companies.
Debt
Given the scenario of economic contraction, the Government of the State applied in July to the public congress for the approval of a 3 billion pesos credit for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, with the aim of reactivating the economy, the approval of the State Congress was 2,600 billion pesos and until November no debt benefit was observed in any sector of the State economy.
Reactions
For employers, the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdés demonstrates a lack of management capacity of the Government.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry, stated that in 2011 there was no harmonization of the wills of the different sectors, including the Government of the State.
"The performance of the Sinaloa economy during this year has really been very poor, we have to work hard to recover the land we lost this year, in 2012 we have to double our efforts, we have to align the effort of all and above all the good already synchronized progress of this new government team, hopefully next year will be much better," he said.
Economic slowness
Loredo López stated that events such as ice cream from the beginning of the year have retained the state economy and restricted its performance and growth.
"The low economic flow is produced from several events, including frosts, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that doesn't turn fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows to have an acceptable level of flow in trials, products and services and therefore at the end of the year we close much below the expectations we had," he said.
Redefine vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Patron Confederation of the Mexican Republic of Sinaloa stated that we want to channel the state towards more dynamic productive activities.
"In general terms we have observed that work has been done, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme that redefines the vocation and economic direction of the State, because it is important that all the potential of Sinaloa's material and human resources be destroyed," he said.
A lot to do
The Chairman of the Coparmex stressed the importance of developing a vision for the future that better channels the Government's efforts.
"In general terms, I would say that the Government has made efforts to deliver good results in different areas of economic development, there are some advances, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in the management of public policy.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is more inclusive, what I can say is that much work has been done and the Government is aware of the fact that there is still much to do," he said.
Sentenced for 8 kilos of marijuana
A resident person in Novolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days of fine for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Public Prosecutor's Office has informed that the convicted small smuggler is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for health crime, in his variant of possession of marijuana for sale.
Pursuant to file AP/SIN/CLN/68/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by Mexican Army agents on 7 June 2010 during a surveillance operation in Cipriano Valdez Street, in front of number 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The small trafficker was circulating in a white pick-up truck, in which he carried a black bag in the vehicle's trunk and on the co-pilot's place a small backpack on the back where the military found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, confiscated items have been made available to the Second District Judge and the convicted person is still in the Criminal Legal Consequences Enforcement Centre.
Debts to contributions to works
Social works included in programs such as Habitat, Rescue of Public Spaces and 3x1 for migrants may not be completed where there are serious delays due to lack of economic resources, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The Director of Municipal Social Development indicated that although the construction programmes have so far progressed, they are at risk, as the Government of the State has not fulfilled its obligations to provide contributions exceeding 11 million pesos in the three programmes.
He reported that, in total, the investment of these three programmes is approximately 50 million pesos, of which the State has to provide 25 per cent and so far only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for the works, so there is a possibility of delay in finalizing them.
"They must make a contribution of 12 million and despite the fact that the year will soon end they have given us nothing, even if since July they had to give us a share," he says, "and we, in order not to record delays, we have started the works and we have made much progress, but we need money."
He mentioned that last year, during the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State had not paid the corresponding contributions, so at the beginning of the administration the Municipality had to apply for a credit to cover the 7 million that the administration of the State had not provided on that occasion.
"We had already experienced this in the previous six-year period because the State had not had the economic capacity to participate and the programmes continue to work and this year we, in order to access these programs, had to obtain the resources to cover what the State had not paid," he said.
Despite the fact that there is a commitment by the State authorities to provide these resources, he stated that they had applied to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to activate management to ensure that the corresponding percentages arrive as quickly as possible.
"They must provide almost 12 million and despite the fact that the year will soon end, they have given us nothing."
The Court validates the "analytical cut" in Mexico in 2015
Replacing analogue signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes that the world has experienced in recent years
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) has raised the constitutional controversy that the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have formulated against the presidential decree which advances the so-called "analytical coupura" from 2021 to 2015, since the eight votes necessary for the invalidate were not brought together.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his duties when he issued the decree detailing the actions to be taken to bring about the transition to digital terrestrial television.
With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic was dismissed for failing to reach the qualified majority of eight votes so that the Court could decide whether or not the constitutionality of the decree was constitutional, and this continues to be in force.
The draft sentence, prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed the declaration of the decree as non-constitutional, because the regulation on radio and television is an assignment reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and statutory reserve.
In favor of the project, only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have promoted two constitutional controversies in order to challenge the decree and by admitting complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero has suspended the application of the decree and all actions provided by it for the digital transition.
The plenary session of the Ministers also decided to dismiss the complaint made by the Chamber of Deputies, without discussing the draft of which Minister Sánchez Cordero is also responsible.
In his speech, the President said that he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the Federal Executive cannot structure through general standards measures for the preparation of public administration.
"I also consider that if it were to be done it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," and he recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the Federal Executive, which has as its constitutional mandate the leadership of the State.
Replacing analogue signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes that the world has experienced in recent years and this leads to better use of the radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
Adjourned the change, he said, would adjourn the benefits of digitisation which involves a decision of public interest which has not only a technical dimension, "because it also includes economic, social, political and national security issues".
These issues, he stressed, "requires the operation of an entire system to establish, in accordance with the principle of economic leadership of the State, a group of powers granted by the Constitution to the power of the Executive of the State".
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the digital transition and have done so through the Executive, despite having the highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, by issuing the contested decree, has somehow invaded the sphere of competence of Congress, because it ensures in the administrative sphere the respect of the laws issued by the Legislative, he assures.
The possibility of a vote-by-vote account in Michoacán is analysed.
According to the data shown by PREP, the difference between the first and second place of the Governor's election is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total minutes.
The possibility of counting "voting by vote" is a reality with regard to the election process this year in Michoacán, where according to the data shown by the Preliminary Electoral Results Program (PREP) the difference between the first and second place of the Governor's election is only 27 percent, even without accounting for the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total minutes.
In this regard, the President of the General Council of the Michoacán Electoral Institute (IEM), María de los Angeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines to harmonise local standards to the federal electoral reform.
It will be recalled that Michoacán did not approve either his Political Constitution or his Electoral Code of State or his Electoral Justice Act, while the Congress of the State approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for this electoral trial to enter into force and Governor Lionel Godoy Rangel omitted his publication within the time limits provided for by the Act of the Official Journal of the State, arguing that he had some objections.
On the same November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the local Legislative Power and described as "invalid and illegal" the vote of the State's representative for constitutional reforms, since it has no right to "sanction or challenge them".
Interviewed on the possibility of the "vote by vote", María de los Angeles Llanderal stated that through the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the IEM General Council it will be possible to make partial and total votes by the local electoral body.
Thus, the partial counting of votes, one or more electoral packages, it may be possible that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there is no vote record and counting in the ballot file is not in the chairman of the ballot; or there are obvious errors or alterations in the minutes.
In addition, the total counting of votes received in all polls of the election can be achieved when there is an indication that the difference between the alleged successful candidate of the respective election and the one who obtained the second place in the poll is equal or below a percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is an express petition from the party representative and/or coalition who presented the second of the candidates indicated.
The total polling may also take place if at the end of the joint counting it follows that the difference between the alleged winner and the second candidate is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that there is an express petition from the representative of the political party whose candidate has been second, in which case the electoral packages that have been the subject of the partial counting will be excluded.
It should be mentioned that this is the situation of the election of Morelia, where according to the PREP, the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16 percent, even without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total minutes.
His Last Will
His ashes will be spread in the Sierra Zapaliname, confirm the family.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés will arrive in Saltillo, his hometown, this Sunday towards the night, and on Monday people will present their tributes and there will be a requiem mess.
According to his family, the last will of the Lieutenant-Colonel was that his ashes should be spread in the Sierra Zapaliname.
After receiving tributes from other people who died in the accident, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to the capital of Coahuila on the board of an aircraft of the Mexican Air Forces, the closest attended the ceremony in Campo Mars.
At noon the ashes of the Lieutenant-Colonel arrived at the guard chapel of the Boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza, where the family and friends visited.
At 17:30 a.m., he was paid tribute to the Saltillo Institute of Technology organized by his former colleagues of technological baccalaureate and the American football team of which Felipe Bacio was part when he was preparing for the baccalaureate.
"He wanted to go back to Saltillo and have his ashes spread in the Sierra Zapaliname, he always said this to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
For her, the lieutenant colonel had realized all his dreams, she considered himself to be at the fullness of her life, "he had success, he was a father and son, extraordinary, an affectionate brother and cared for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés abandoned the city of Saltillo very young to register at the College of Air in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some couldn't believe it, because they said he even had truck damage; but he always followed his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers that he was a very good person, "when he was in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, as this was the occasion in which he brought Martha Sahagón to Saltillo".
The young man even remembers that when he was 7 years old he traveled to Zapopán for his parent's graduation, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he loved most in life: piloting an aircraft.
His Last Farewell
With honours it was said to the Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, a tribute that led Governor Jorge Torres López, presented by the people and the Government of the State, the Mexican Army, through the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force, directors and students of the Institute of Technology in Saltillo, where he studied in 1985 and distinguished himself both in studies and in sport.
Bacio Cortés recently died when the helicopter he was flying crashed, alongside the government secretary, José Francisco Blake Mora and six others, all officials of this service.
The remains of the driver Bacio Cortés born in Saltillo arrived (incinerated) at 18:05 hours to be handed over by the funeral to the members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, on the group's plane, where he was expected by his family, including his daughter Amanda and her wife Cristina, her mother, her brothers and other parents, students and masters.
Three abandoned bodies located in the property of Cadreyta NL
A few hours before it was found, the military authority had presented to the media eleven persons who had been arrested in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crimes.
Three men were found shots shot in different parts of the body and with the blow of grace, in an abandoned property of the municipality of Cadreyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery took place 1.5 km from Cadreyta to Santiago, in the community known as El Castillo.
Some people who passed through this place observed that in the property, whose fence with beige color and coffee, the portal was wide open.
Looking inside, about three metres away, they located the bodies of three persons, which is why they immediately informed the corresponding authorities.
One of the individuals wore a yellow T-shirt with dark jeans, without shoes; next to him was another with a white T-shirt, with straps.
One meter away there was another individual's body with a red T-shirt and blue jeans.
The three were spread over the belly.
According to the data obtained in situ, the three people had been murdered elsewhere, because no evidence was found in situ.
In the closure of the property there were legends directed by a group of organized crime to the other, apart from a few bullet holes in the property and in the portal.
11 captured at Cadreyta
The Secretary of National Defence introduced 11 persons, including a minor, who was part of a criminal group that operated primarily in the municipality of Cadreyta and were considered to be related to kidnappings, homicides, "halconeo" (surveillance) and clandestine inhumations.
According to the information published, eight people were arrested in the colony of Los Alveros on 11 November and one who had been deprived of liberty was successfully saved.
They were confiscated from three buildings and one cell phone; they claimed to be part of the criminal group called "Los Zetas".
In another event that took place on 12 November at 06:00 hours, the military personnel took a surveillance course in Rancho Viejo, Cadreyta, by detecting a car without registration plate with two subjects on board.
By arresting them and conducting an inspection, the military found a long weapon, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Later and after these statements, on November 13th at 2:00 p.m. one of his accomplices was arrested in La Frauda, when he tried to escape by seeing the military.
They are attributed clandestine inmutations in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadreyta.
The new Italian government will be formed Wednesday
Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has brought this country to the brink of the economic disaster.
Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet on Wednesday with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has brought Italy to the brink of the economic disaster and put the whole Eurozone at risk.
A communiqué from the Presidential Palace announced that Monti, appointed Sunday, would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he could form the Government.
It is expected that he will present a cabinet composed in his majority by technocrats, even if it is not clear when the new executive will take office.
Monti said he was going to present to the president the outcome of his discussions with political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," said the former European Commissioner to journalists.
Monti did not explicitly say that he could form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles had been overcome.
The "framework is now well drawn", he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, in a shorter time than normally, while Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has driven the costs of its debt to levels that are impossible to support.
The new administration led by the former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package required by the European leaders to regain the confidence in Italy that had been affected.
By stressing the pressure on Monti to hurry, the instability of the markets to place the performance of the Italian obligations BTP at 10 years above 7 per cent, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to be saved.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian employer Confindustria, told the media after her meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government a lot."
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to emerge from this emergency situation.
Monti's chances of success were greatly stimulated by the support of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party, to which the crisis was forced to resign last Saturday.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti will have a good result," said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the right-centre party.
The support of PDL, the largest Italian party, is significant because so far many of its members have opposed the government of a technocratic majority that Monti forms.
Parliamentary support
The new government in Monti must have strong parliamentary support to implement what is likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blocking or delay in its efforts could lead to a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks added to the pressure by observing that a bankruptcy of Monti would be a disaster.
Monti began consultations on Monday with political parties, trade unions and employers' groups and youth and women's organizations.
He'll finish his round of meetings Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, who has authorized an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief review at the end of last week, when it was clear that Berlusconi was going to resign, Italian debt costs have now returned to critical levels among the uncertainty about the success of the new Prime Minister.
Saving Italy, with a public debt of EUR 1.9 billion, would be too much for the current financial defences of Eurozone.
Monti said that his Government should continue until the forthcoming elections, scheduled for 2013, despite the generalized predictions that politicians would only give him time to implement reforms before the elections are made.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his office, but the big parties insist that it should be formed only by specialists, an indication of their objections to a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources reported that mutual mistrust and disagreement between parties complicate the attempt to include political figures.
The experience of the Spanish is superior to that of the Costa Ricans
Of the 22 footballers called from Spain, ten participated in more than 50 international games.
On the part of Costa Rica, only one of the 22 summoned participated in 50 meetings.
A huge contrast to that of Costa Rica, compared to the 22 convened by the two countries for today's friend friend at 15:05 am at San José National Stadium.
While the national and European champions, the number one of FIFA's monthly rankings, account for a large record of Class A inter-selection games, the Tricolor only has Defender Michael Umana as the only one to have the 50 international games.
This figure was reached last Friday in the match against Panama (0-2) on Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish footballers who play in the League of Stars and in powerful clubs of the First League of England maintain an intense activity in national league and coup championships and fights in European Cups such as the Champions League.
To all this we must add the experience with Furia Espanola during the complicated eliminations of the European Cup and the World Cup.
Costa Rican footballers, on the contrary, have an international experience limited to an area, such as Concaf, which is considered to be of a lower level in FIFA.
We see that the largest record of the Spanish selection is that of the goal guard Iker Casillas, who on the previous Saturday against England (defence 0-1 in London) equaled the record of the former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international meetings.
Casillas will play today against the Tricolore and they will impose a new record for Spain, of 120 international games.
Xavi Hernández, cerebral steering wheel of Barcelona, at 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized the previous week by UEFA in addition to the other hundred years of the Iberian team, Zubizarreta mentioned above with 126 and the front centre of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
Lend of the centenary number is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
It is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fabregas, with 61 and David Silva, with 53.
On the Costa Rican side, and near Michael Umana are the left side Júnior Díaz, with 48 presences and the buster Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After this, only five have passed the 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain include Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 presences, Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest doesn't even reach 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Victor Bolívar has only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson have not started yet.
The historic buster of Spain is David Villa, with 50 flies, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who records the most, with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto has included the country in its turn to celebrate two decades of trajectory
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has become a reality"
In the exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said the group is ready to offer one of its best concerts next Sunday on the National Stadium.
They have waited for more than 20 years, but the group assures that for them it will also become a dream to happen in this country.
It was that the bassist and founding member Jeff Ament assured, speaking exclusively to Viva, Brazil, last week.
The group is located in the South American wing of its two decades of work celebration tour and Sunday 20 will make its only stopover in Central America.
That day will be on the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., next to the Los Angeles The X group and the Las Robertas nationals.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, whose complete transcription is found in La Nación on the Internet.
For his Costa Rican followers, the fact that Pearl Jam will happen in Costa Rica is a dream come true. Are you aware of what your fans are living?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has become a reality for us too.
This is our second time in South and Central America and so far it has been great.
I spent only once on vacation in Costa Rica; it's such a beautiful country and I think we can spend a few days there.
We are therefore moved to bring our music there.
I ask you, because there is some kind of devotion to the group, fans live with intensity the previous days.
What is your message for your most fervent followers?
Thank you for staying with us all these years.
It took 21 years for us to arrive in Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry that it has been so long since this concert.
Some people already say his concert is the biggest show of the year.
Does this add some pressure to your visit.
Some of the biggest shows we've had in the last 21 years have been held in the last two weeks.
We have offered a two giant shows in Sao Paolo and we hope that this has set us up for this concert in Costa Rica.
We are really looking forward to producing it.
We love this country, we love surfing and jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you discover Costa Rica and its waves to surf?
We have a lot of surfing friends and I have a really good friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves are incredible there.
My friends were always going to surf in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, next to Mexico, are great places for surfing; that's how we learned it through people who love surfing.
Seeing the tour, you've seen huge shows, with lots of songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
As we have never produced there, we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to make the best possible show, with a wide variety of songs; we will try to interpret two songs from each album and offer our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the directory.
What does that owe you?
I think it's partly because we have nine albums and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, that's why it's very difficult to choose which songs to play every evening.
When we have two or three songs in the directory that we have no longer interpreted for a long time, it helps us to stay focused and surprises us because it reminds us of why we loved these songs and that we may have forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting to us and therefore I think it becomes more interesting to people.
With this tour, you celebrate 20 years of journey.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you've done?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I believe that none of us had imagined that we were going to form a large rock group, and the fact that we did it for more than 20 years makes it seem like a dream.
We continue to tell our blessings and the fact that we can continue to make music together makes us very excited.
We love each other and love to create music.
We are fortunate to go to places in the world to which we have always wanted to go.
Things couldn't be better for us.
What does it mean to you to have been a fundamental element in the creation of the grunge?
It has always been an honour for us to be part of this group of major groups.
We are very friendly with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
This is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is unusual.
From time to time, a group emerged from a city, but it is much stranger when five or ten groups come out of the same city at the same time.
We are proud and it is an honor for us to be part of the Seattle Group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we took part in a festival with Alice in Chains and we went to Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on their tour, so we're lucky to be still friends with all of them and it's an honor for us to be part of that Seattle sound that emerged.
It is also very strange that a group like yours stays together and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us were together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and only this is much longer than many groups normally last.
Firstly, I believe that we are all lucky to be still alive and, secondly, we are all concerned about others.
We are all intimate friends and thanks to this there are musical boulevards that give everyone freedom to experience.
We have confidence in each other with each other's music and it could not go better.
Your relationship with the word celebrity has not been easy; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do whatever you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we grew up, it was easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure that we don't spend too much time on tour because it's easy to fall into this game of great crowds and people who love your music.
If we don't forget that people are here for music, it helps us not to forget that we need to respect music and what brought it, without thinking about the fact that we're famous and a rock star, which doesn't really matter to any of us.
How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote good songs and at first it was great.
We were a group for almost three years and did not publish a record before Andy's death (Andrew Woods).
There were a lot of frustrations about the fact that it lasted so little and most importantly is the fact that we are still very friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the group with us and when I listen to a song or see a picture I think of the incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to work, laugh, talk about music, football and many other things with him.
He was a surprising human being and we miss him.
The Las Robertas National Group will open the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know his work, especially Eddie Vedder, and for that you chose it for opening?
Yes, production sent us videos with different proposals and that was the group we loved most, so we look forward to seeing what Las Robertas can offer on-line and it must be very distracting.
Why do you always change the words of Yello Ledbetter live?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he does it with the first words he imagines.
As a bassist, what are his influences?
There's so much...
Among the first ones I remember is Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many influences that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I love.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep under the grunt despite the fact that it is no longer fashionable?
I think we all feel a little disconnected from the grunge word.
When I think of it, it reminds me of the groups that I just mentioned, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those that came up at the same time and, if it's relevant now, I think it's wonderful, because it's a music worth listening to and groups like Mudhoney are now doing the best music ever.
At first, his music had a darker content and now it has become more positive.
What is the reason for this change?
That's interesting, because I think there are songs in the new album that seem lighter, but there are also songs, such as The End or Just Breake qualified as very dark songs, even though they may sound a little positive.
With both of them, when Ed played them for me, I cried when I listened to them and these are deeply obscure songs.
I think that if you grow up and there's a trauma in your life and you lose a relative or a friend, these things start to influence your art and your music and these songs, they probably represent it to me.
I also think that we can also be happy and even like that we can make dark music.

Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized on Tuesday in a public hospital to be assessed for the loss of muscle strength in his feet, informed his family doctor.
Fujimori, 72, serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during her Government (1990-2000), suffers from various conditions, including language cancer for which he has been operated four times and is under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, his personal physician, said for TV channel N that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the reason for pain and loss of strength in its lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate for the benefit of retribution for humanitarian reasons, he probably said that he did not want it because he felt innocent.
It has been operated four times of tongue cancer, it has a weight loss of 18 kilos, and other conditions, such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreas cyst, kidney calculations, arterial hypertension and foot circulation problems, listed the doctor.
Fujimori has been serving detention since September 2007 in the National Directorate of Special Police Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people because of an army annihilation squadron who operated clandestinely during the first few years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political links
An official procession, headed by Uruguayan President José Mujica, and made up of various ministers and employers, will launch a visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two nations and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, the highest point of a long agenda of meetings with the political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the community of Uruguayan residents in Mexico, according to the agenda broadcast by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will be "proper for the exchange of information in political affairs between the two nations", according to the information published by the Presidency of the South American country on its website.
According to local media, Mujica seeks to convince Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France which took place when French representative Nicolas Sarkozy included South American country on the list of tax havens, at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community countries that continue to be tax havens, a declaration that provoked Uruguay's rejection and the call for consultations of its ambassador from that European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group of the world's strongest emerging and developed countries, and has been in force with the South American country since January this year to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan Government has tried in recent years to speed up the implementation of tax exchange agreements to exit the "grid list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), integrated by countries that do not implement all international standards of tax cooperation.
In terms of trade, Mexico and Uruguay have been in force since 2004 a Free Trade Treaty (CTA) which has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The moustach lead passes to the three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario struggled, untiringly, for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the claws of the evil Bowser, but he had never done so in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of the young woman in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which arrives this month at stores around the world, was designed from the beginning to exploit the characteristics of the Nintendo 3DS mobile console, which allows to play in three dimensions without wearing glasses.
"Mario is the character who has to say how the stereoscopy without glasses should work," said Nintendo's specialist press manager in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first video game Nintendo originally designed for this medium", because so far successes such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo's spokesperson argued that despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "accessible" video game that allows a fast and fluid part.
Álvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to hang the less skilled users.
Once overcome, the most experienced will be able to make a "second round" at the game levels, which this time are more difficult.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an "D aggressive" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it would be necessary to play in three dimensions in order to overcome the different challenges and "not succumb to optical illusions".
This incursion of Super Mario in the three dimensions also implies the return of the character to a mobile console, which had not happened since 2005.
In these video games Nintendo takes an eye to the saga fans and repeats the formula of success of previous games, which consists in the fact that the moustach lead must travel endangered platforms to free Princess Peach.
Even though I find novelties in movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also in the case of Luigi "playable".
Colom endorses Portillo's extradition to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he had ordered the extradition of former Governor Alfonso Portillo to respond to the United States for the conspiracy for the laundering of US$70 million.
So the trial ended for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country that called for Portillo to judge it.
At the press conference, Colom stated that his decision was in accordance with the independence of the judiciary and the executive branch, taking into account the fact that a court of first instance had already ordered his extradition.
He stated that during his term "he had not helped" in any judicial resolution and had conducted all extraditions he had experienced.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Morocco will also be extradited for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes will be extradited for drug trafficking.
What Colom has done implies an executive approach after exhausting all judicial and constitutional bodies to judge the former 2004-2004 term of office.
According to the resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Tribunal and the Court of Constitutionality (CC), Portillo should be extradited after having resolved its legal situation in Guatemala and having guaranteed its human rights.
Portillo was absolute for misappropriation of Q120 million funds in the Ministry of Defence when he was president, who was the trial prior to extradition, but the Public Department appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was born to avoid marginalization of young people without training
The review of the first 25 years of life of the social support entity Trinijove is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have been helped to overcome a difficult situation during this quarter of the century.
This is in addition to the long-term number of jobs currently obtained by this social group.
The anniversary was used yesterday to review an event celebrated in a former industrial complex in Fabra i Coats, attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was born in the neighborhood of Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping untrained people, without work, with problems of substance abuse or marginalization.
Yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu has concentrated a large number of heads of entities and institutions who have collaborated with the association in the last 25 years.
The diverse political representation, in the middle of the election season, showed the unitary nature of the work carried out by Trinijove.
In addition to the President of the Catalan Regional Government (Generalitat), Artur Mas and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, attended the event by former Minister of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragal and former Deputy Mayor of the Mayor and current Eco-Socialist municipal councillor Richard Goma.
The current Minister of Social Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries and the Director General of Charity of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa, were also present in the large room of Fabra i Coats.
Mas stated that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that the present one is also very difficult, but he added that the work accomplished so far "is a good basis".
The president gave Trinijove an example to be able to fight the bad circumstances and to give hope to people in difficulty.
"The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it accomplishes," he said.
Property invaded by spatters for microflies, evacuated
The invaders had appropriated 11 of the 13 apartments of the building in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants left the property at noon yesterday without any resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that the residents of Rue Balmes 51 lived ended.
Twelve people volunteered yesterday to leave the building they were occupying illegally and where they organized micro-fests that were desperate for neighbors, in a judicial order and without the need for police intervention.
At the end of the operation, the door lock was changed to prevent the situation from repeating itself.
"From this day on there will be a control of access," said the administrator.
Squatters, which had invaded 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the rest were inhabited - took the electrical installation and part of the water, besides painting the walls and leaving residues of any kind, especially alcoholic drinks.
The first three apartments were the scene of mass parties, which lasted up to two days and looked forward to the tenants.
Next to the building there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which was also affected.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat explained to Europa Press that since the occupation of the building her business had dropped by 80%.
The owner of the discotheque mentioned that the property invaders made him unfair, because they sold the glasses to three euros, while in the discotheque they were worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the entertainment venue had to respond to the complaints of the neighbors for noise, while according to the latter, the inconveniences were not caused by the disco customers, but by the residents of the occupied house and especially the participants at the parties organized there, which were more frequent and intense in the last weeks, according to the irritated neighbors of the area.
The head of the discotheque explained that the trouble was so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the building and it was nine months ago that he "forgave" him rent.
The Urbana Guard (municipal police) also confirmed that in recent weeks they had received more complaints from neighbors about this situation.
Mayor Alberto Fernández Díaz, president of the municipal group of PP, asked last week "the immediate evacuation of the building to end the common life and civic problems that it caused to residents and the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that prior to the summer only one floor of the building was occupied, but in recent months the spatters had occupied all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments and that in some apartments there were flights as well.
It is in this sense that he added that "we must end impunity and be implacable against antisocial behaviour generated in the property".
Yesterday too, the Mossos (Catalan local police) evacuated a building to Nou Barris.
At 3.30 p.m., the police moved to Rue Mont-ral's 35th Street, having received a call from a neighbor who had observed that four people were accessing the building.
All four were arrested immediately.
Park or Mountain?
Architects agree on the opportunity of convening beyond the debate on fees
The municipal competition on 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the already extinct Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration printed promotional posters for Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the large metropolitan Barcelona park.
In addition, it also contained a comparison, in figures, with the Central Park of New York.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park became again, in the imagination of many people, the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital being the only one that does not focus on the north-south axis, if not high (mountain) - low (sea).
Collserola's qualification as a natural park is for the benefit of this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park or Yellowstone, with boars in the role of Yogi bears.
This was the situation until, in September, the city hall convened a mega-competition composed of 16 competitions for all access doors to Collserola.
A door goes back to the park idea, no doubt.
That's it, or someone wants to put doors in the field.
The question appeared alone: Collserola: park or mountain?
The competition, both in terms of its organization and in terms of reflection on the city, is a theme for discussion by all architects in Barcelona.
It is almost a recurring theme of which two members of this former caste of elect speak when they recognize themselves in an elevator.
And this is just one of the few opinions on which three architects from Barcelona, university professors, have coincided.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modal and Marta Bayona: the contest is timely.
For Roldán, after addressing the coastal front "it is necessary to" debate on "the mountain front" because the speech of Ildefons Cerda, that of the pulp of green houses has not been completed.
"We must start from the base that the largest park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, for his great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex," gave the verdict the architect for which the title of "Collserola ports" contains a "lexical trap": they should not be thought of as "access to a park, but the delimitation of certain areas in which to act".
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urbanist world, calls the proposal as "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers".
Risks arising from the "uncertainty of the projection of public space" after the experience experienced in the '80s and had in the area of the Forum "his singing of swan".
The first fear is the very delimitation of the borders on which one can build.
"Limiting something means already establishing the next step," that is, its overrun.
"We need to think about new urban planning instruments, because the current ones [in reference to the Metropolitan General Plan (PGM)] can cause real disasters."
With more emphasis on the question, Modol feels that, by simplifying, the side of the El Valles de Collserola region "may be heard as a park, that of Barcelona, no".
Modal recalls that there is already a work done by the Patronate of Collserola that "must not be lost", thanking the mayor for the opportunity that the city council offers its corporation to intervene in this project "from the first moment".
In addition, he understands that the proximity of the mountain with the city is the exception- conduit that allows architects to enter the debate, but "doubt" if this technical profile should lead multidisciplinary teams ("all success," he says) that we have to create: "We architects, we should only be an instrument".
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gives the title of this play is complex, because the bases of the competition lacks an overall vision of Collserola: "We have convened 16 cross-cutting contests - he says - in the mountain-sea sense, but there is no longitudinal reading that leads and understands the area as a whole".
This makes, at least in this case, that he chose to participate in the 16 competitions.
In another way, a project to enable one of the doors to be impacted in the program and definition with that of the architect of the neighbouring door.
In its opinion, yes, the mayor should ensure that the band immediately exceeds that of Ronda de Dalt should provide, in its entirety, an area of equipment that makes a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgive Jonás Larrazábal and it will be released
After 72 days of provisional arrest, the Casino Red's legal power foundation granted forgiveness to the Mayor of Monterrey's brother for the trial initiated against him for alleged blackmails
After 72 years of arrest, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the foundation of the legal power of the Red Casino grants him forgiveness before the Second District Criminal Court, which follows a trial for blackmail against the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey.
After the attack of the Casino Royale, the owner of the Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jonás allegedly demanded payment of an economic quota so that the Mayor of Monterrey would allow the clandestine operation of the gaming house.
After the public denunciation, the prosecution opened a criminal trial against the PANist Mayor's brother and on September 2, he was arrested and held in pretrial detention for 30 days.
After four hours before the Public Prosecutor's Officer 3 of Heritage Crimes, he was transferred to Detention Centre 1, located in the Old Quarter of the State Capital.
He remained there for the next 49 days when a second detention order was issued after the Public Prosecutor's Office had dismissed the crimes of corruption and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to the Cadereyta penal center allegedly for having made the owners of the Red Casino sing with a million and a half pesos; but he spent only a few hours in the middle-security detention center because there were threats of death against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the trial in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On 25 October a warrant was issued by the Registrar of the Second District Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who said that after almost two months of investigation there was sufficient confirmed evidence to determine the guilt of Jonás, such as that relating to the cashing of 1.5 million pesos of the gambling house representatives in exchange for its operation.
This Monday, the foundation of the legal power of the Casino Red, Victor Aldo García Gómez, presented himself before Judge José Luis Pecina to seek forgiveness for the brother of the mayor of the region, so he could recover his freedom in the following hours.
During the legal proceedings, the Public Prosecutor's Office attached to the Tribunal, Ramiro Arias, questioned García Gómez if the damage had been recovered and which gambling partner had been the one who had granted the pardon, but the lawyer tried not to disclose the name.
Under file 197/2011, legal pardon is granted to Jonás Larrazábal and subsequently no claim may be filed for the trial against him; no compensation shall be sought from him and no punishment shall be imposed either.
After the hearing of the foundation of the legal power of the playhouse, at 15:50 hours the immediate freedom of Larrazabal Bretón was ordered.
The Registrar of the Tribunal, Jorge Yánez, moved to the prison of San Nicolás de los Garza to inform Jonás that he had been legally forgiven and his file would be classified.
He will also provide him with the order of immediate release issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionysio Pérez Jácome gives details of the air accident in which the Secretary of the Government, Francisco Blake and seven other people lost their lives
The Communications and Transport Secretariat (TBS) reported that the results of the accident in which the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora and seven others lost his life indicate that the helicopter directly hit the ground in full structural integrity, without the pilot being able to attempt forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionysio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that prior to takeoff of the aircraft, the pilot found that the climate conditions were adequate to fly.
"The elements that appear to indicate that the unit had various contact with the ground, the blades had contact with the trees 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage."
He also informed that the unit was designed for 19 persons, so the unit met the requirements for the transportation of staff.
In addition, he said that the investigations carried out in the impact area do not report the appearance of ground parts.
"In research it was reported that there are no parts or components of the aircraft elsewhere, the impact has been structurally presented.
"The helicopter had been designed for 19 passengers and met the requirements for carrying them.
The soil had a slope of seven to 30 degrees of inclination.
For the time being, the secretary has assured that a priority is to have the results as soon as possible; but the investigation can last a few months, it can even last a year.
In turn, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Airports and Auxiliary Services assured that at the time of the impact, the Presidential Major State helicopter worked fast to cross and it happened on a moving ground.
"This information supports the assumption of normal operation crossing at the time of impact," he said.
During the press conference, TBS holder Pérez Jácome listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual Flight:
According to the aeronautical regulations, the flight was carried out according to the rules of the visual flight, which implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The reports in the MIA mentioned adequate take-off conditions, and as the aircraft moved towards the border area between DF and the State of Mexico, there were low-level nebulosity layers.
Selected paths:
It is likely that due to the conditions of nebulosity the crew sought a lower height area and more visibility towards the Cuernavaca Valley.
Location of impact.
The impact coordinates and the last recording of the aircraft on the radar coincide, probably prior to the impact there was no loss of control or alteration of the flight path.
Dispersion of aircraft remains in a reduced area:
The information available so far allows us to assume that the impact has taken place on a straight and side path.
The aircraft remains dispersal model suggests that the helicopter has hit the ground under conditions of structural integrity.
No trace of fire or explosion was detected:
At the site of the disaster, there is always no trace in the remaining aircraft of an explosion or fire type.
The latest findings of the investigation indicate that the aircraft had had multiple contact with the ground.
During the field work, parts of the aircraft were found at a height of 9 thousand 200 feet above the average level of the sea, the ground had a slope ranging from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which he possibly disarticulated along his journey.
The information provides elements that appear to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts with the ground.
After careful search in a larger area than the surrounding area, around the accident, no scattered parts of the aircraft were found, which supports the assumption that the impact occurred under structural integrity conditions.
MSS announces protocol to find the gene of obesity
Social insurance conducts an investigation to discover the genes of obesity in the case of children and young people; this is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Insurance (IMSS) announced that it conducts an investigation to discover the genes of obesity in the case of children and young people, called the 'Genetic protocol of obesity of children and adolescents' that will allow for the markers associated with overweight.
In a communiqué, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry of the National Medical Centre's Hospital of the 20th Century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been formed.
This team is supported by third-cycle specialists and students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) from the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
In the investigation, the right to participate in the population, whether or not they are entitled, is invited to participate in the IMSS sports units in Valle de México, where evidence is carried out to minors every Saturday from 8:00 p.m.
He stressed that the protocol began in the Quauhtémoc Sports Unit (State of Mexico Poniente) and that from 8 October, the activity took place in the Sports Unit of Nezahualcoyolt (State of Mexico East).
After reaching the goal of gathering 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue in the Independent Sports Unit (south of Federal District) and finally in the Morelos Sports Unit (northern of Federal District).
He explained that the objective of this investigation and the objective of this research is to identify the components and the importance of genetics in the development of obesity and to identify risk factors for children and young Mexicans to prevent the onset of chronic degenerative diseases.
As the World Diabetes Day will be celebrated on 14 November, he mentioned that the goal is to bring together three thousand children and young people between the ages of six and 14, with the consent and under the supervision of their parents, for the application of specific food questionnaires.
They will also be asked about their physical activity and family legacy history of their diseases, to avoid risk factors that trigger conditions such as diabetes or kidney failure.
It detailed that Saturdays will be applied to all participants of anthropometric measurements (weights, size, circumference of size), blood pressure, determination of glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetics (identification of people associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz López reported that this investigation is the result of the concern of health professionals for alarming weight gain in minors.
'The 1999 and 2006 health surveys reported that in only six years, in the case of boys, there was an increase of 77 per cent in obesity and in the case of girls of 47 per cent; in the case of overweight there was also a dramatic increase', emphasized the IMSS specialist.
He indicated that the justification for the search for markers is based on the fact that the country's population is different from others by its genetic history.
He reported that, on average, Mexicans have 65 per cent of indo-American inheritance, 30 per cent European and five per cent African inheritance, and this condition is reflected in people associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, obesity genetics translates into the inability to burn the excess energy consumed (calories), which is deposited in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants is the full assessment of children, which helps to detect whether they have a degree of overweight or obesity.
He even said that the presence of dark colour folds (canthosis) on the neck and forearms indicate the probability of suffering from metabolic and even prediabetes alterations.
The information is managed in a confidential way, doctors send it in writing to parents, to whom each of the measures and changes in the lifestyle that they must make to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentarism, which is the lack of daily physical activity, remain most of the day sitting in front of the TV and use means of transport instead of walking over short distances.
Another cause is the high caloric intake, i.e. the largest consumption of sugar drinks, carbohydrates of carbon (tamals - pasta of corn flour wrapped in corn leaves - bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and the genetics analyzed in this protocol.
UNAM asphalt would avoid cassis
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry of UNAM, develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with better performance, regardless of environmental conditions and temperature
If the signs that the pavement was resolved, it would no longer be necessary to repair about 200 thousand cases each rainy season in the Metropolitan Area of Valle de México, warns Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ), UNAM, who ensured that if the process of construction and maintenance of the bituminous pavement is adequate, the cases could be reduced or even completely eliminated.
During his lecture A technological opinion on cassis, organized in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory he is responsible for develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of the asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera considered that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve performance, and therefore the formation of cassis.
He explained that the asphalt, the heavier part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, molecules with a heavier molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and molecules with a low molecular weight, called maltenes, which together give the pavement its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behaviour of the asphalt consists in the fact that at high temperatures, almost 180 degrees, behaves as a liquid, at 120 degrees C its viscosity is very large and at 50 degrees C it presents an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes broken, adds it.
This means that in the streets the asphalt resistance is not uniform and changes during the day according to environmental conditions and temperature, warns the chemical engineering specialist.
The FQ researcher observed that the streets of Ciudad de México were mostly covered by a flexible pavement consisting of six layers of materials, the last three of which involve asphalt.
Among the more superficial layers is the asphalt layer, formed by small stones bathed in asphalt and subsequently compacted.
Each of the small stones that form the layer, he says, is bathed an asphalt.
When vehicles pass through it by generating efforts, it allows forces to spread very well in the pavement.
If we had modified asphalt, they would spread better, thinking the chemical engineer.
On the asphalt layer, he says, one puts a last layer called a bearing layer, made of fine stone, i.e., sand which is also bathed in asphalt.
Since this is the layer in contact with the wheels of the vehicles, it must have more mechanical force than the asphalt layer and provide adhesion in the street.
Being the part of the pavement that receives and distributes the efforts, the bearing layer also requires that it has an adequate thickness and the material it is made must be treated.
The climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, is also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he says, because they significantly affect the performance of the asphalt layer.
When the soil gets wet, the water spreads inside the layer is difficult for it to get out, which softens all layers of the pavement and therefore causes the cassis.
In the case of the formation of a case, he said, the first to be wasted is the rolling film and only subsequently is affected the asphalt layer, but the damage does not take place immediately, but it is a process that must be treated to the first signals with adequate maintenance programs.
The member of the National Research System explained that the load of vehicles is another important factor in the formation of cassis and therefore the thickness of each layer of the pavé must always be linked to the load of vehicles and ensure its satisfaction, in order to avoid frequent formation of cassis.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to be done to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, bituminous emulsions, which in other countries already exist on the market and enable the cases to be repaired easily and without having to use high temperatures.
What did the candidate of Valle miss to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that caused Melina Ramírez Serna not to get the crown of Miss Colombia.
Valle receives title number 14 of princess.
Again Valle del Cauca remained with the desire to win the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to be content with the fact that she was on the winning podium, wearing the silver crown and the band that accredited her as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico was raised with the crown and the scepter, the already 14 titles of Princesse and Melina were joined by a legion of women from Valle del Cauca who were found near the crown but were proclaimed princesses, including Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (83), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanca (1988), Monica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcès Aljure (2008).
Today the big question many people ask themselves is:
What did he miss? Because the result represents the defeat of a great favourite that in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, because she had not been elected in vain Queen of Police and Best Face Jolie de Vogue, titles obtained by Queens Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor considered key in the decision taken by the jury to appoint her First Princess is the fact that she did not convince with her answer to the question "?What was the book that marked you and why? asked by Martín Murillo Gómez of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
Here is the answer from the candidate for Valle to this question:
"I read a lot, I believe enough in literature, I think it's a form of culturalization, I definitely believe that the book that marked my childhood is "The Little Prince", it's quite a deep book.
Now I read "Crime and Punishment", it is a book of universal literature that we should all read; and now I read the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a very beautiful book called "The Ardor of Blood".
This response did not please first of all because of the term "culturalizing" and secondly not to explain concretely how each book quoted it had marked it.
But at the end of the Melina ceremony she said she felt calm and happy with the result "the universe and wise, what must happen is happening.
And for everyone, please read a little, "The Little Prince" is a great book"
Among the assumptions put forward is that Valle was destroyed by favoritism.
A journalist from Bogota insinuated that being the favorite, the ovation and the candidate who received all the preliminary awards (Oster gastronomy challenge, the public vote for the best craft costume, and Queen Mother), "it awakened the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and that is why she did not shine on the stage".
And this was noted in his first presentation in swimwear at Hilton Beach and his two shows on the eve of the coronation.
Although at both parades she seemed sure of herself, it was noted that she did not have the strength and energy of the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantico.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program "Como en casa" (Like at home), of the RCN Canal stated that the fact that Melina had been appointed princess "confirms the fact that the candidate who wins most of the prizes during the competition does not receive the crown of queen".
In addition, Valle avoided the press at the end, and it was a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury about its interest in social initiatives, which is in fact the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
That is why two days before the election the international jury Lucy Doughty stated that they were looking for a woman engaged in the social needs of her country.
"Only beauty is not enough in a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond physics and focus on its social sensitivity, that before starting the Competition you are already involved in projects," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned because of her faults behind her and the fibrosis that was observed in her abdomen, but this is contradictory, because precisely the jury elected her as the candidate 'Natural Beauty' with the healthier body, good food and responsible physical work.
Queen preparatist Jorge Hernán Orozco acknowledged that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better ones, "but her problem of fibrosis on the abdomen, which in reality had not been too well known to me, left her points on the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos considers that the error of the candidate from Valle was the surgical interventions she had undergone.
"Surgeries are good, but Valle didn't know how to do them.
His body has never been his asset and she has lost because of this aspect."
For this prize, which the National Competition of Beauty gives for the first time, after the swimsuit parade came up a cruel prediction that happened last night, it was said that it was a small gift that Raymundo made to Melina not to give her the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina begins today a year of reign, not as sovereign, but as princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions by designation of the National Competition.
However, she will go through history as one of the queens who, despite her dazzling passage through Cartagena, did not get the crown.
Thus was the work of the person of Cali who identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano
A California dactyloscope went to history like the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these staff members is crucial.
On November 4th, a typist from the CTI of Cali went to history as the person who confirmed the identity of the Supreme Chief of the Farcs: "Alfonso Cano", confronting his fingerprints.
Of the seven dactyloscopes working in the local offices of the ITC, this week was the "availability" tour of Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has worked in the field of judicial investigation for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the municipalities of Chocó, where he often spent more than five days in the forest to reach the place where the bodies were to be identified.
The year 2000 he moved to the capital of Valle and after taking adequate courses, he specialized in typyloscopy, which is the study of friction skin, i.e. palms and feet.
During the week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano, Eliasar was advised to take clothes with him for at least three days.
Something very big was waiting for him.
Friday night he left for Cauca in a Palmira helicopter.
He knew he had to identify two corpses and one of them was suspected to be the man who was leading the oldest guerrilla in the world, so he was asked to take the map with the ten fingerprints of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
But when he arrived with the investigation team at the site of the body, he did not recognize him by his physical appearance, because he was very different from the one he had seen in the media.
He had no beard, he was dressed like a peasant in the area, without glasses and much thinner.
But the prints don't lie.
Accompanied by a Galtonian magnifying glass, ink, picker and lantern, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse with those of the card.
His eye did not deceive him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for confirming to the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón that yes, he was the Supreme Chief of the Farcs.
In search of the fingerprint
For a Dactyloscopeist from Sijín de Cali the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos made to Eliazar González in a press conference for the operation against "Cano", is very significant.
A lot of people don't know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an accurate science, without any margin of error, which can be crucial in resolving crimes.
Apart from identifying the bodies, the dactyloscopeists support investigations into crimes such as theft and murder and confirm the identity of the captured persons.
When captured, many offenders present false identity cards or do not have documents.
We take their fingerprints and search them in the database.
The researcher said that in a case of theft he had to remove part of the wall of a house, because in this place the thief had supported his hand to bring out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not adequate surfaces to draw a fingerprint on them, but in this case we were able to get the fingerprint from all hands and identify the offender who had participated in various flights," he recalls.
The fingerprints may also exclude or confirm suspects in cases of murder.
We recently found a dead man with bottles of drink around him.
Through the investigation it was determined that a parent may be suspected of the crime and indeed a mark on the bottle coincided.
Although it does not guarantee that he is the killer, it puts him on the scene of the crime.
One ITC fingerprinter explained that "digital fingerprints of objects with chemical or physical reagents" are extracted.
When they appear, a picker or band is used to remove them.
Later, fingerprints are sent to Asif, the declining database, or to the National Civil Registry.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without papers," said the ITC expert.
He explained that everything is not how it is shown in the CSI television program.
Like everything that shines is not gold, everything that you touch does not necessarily become a footprint.
However, it can be used if the necessary confrontation is achieved.
"Indignants" challenge authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters flocked in front of Zuccotti Square to camp there.
A large part of the people have acceded to the evacuation order and moved to a nearby park.
The members of the Occupy Wall Street movement challenged the New York authorities on Tuesday by trying to enter again, through a court order, instead of Manhattan, where they were evacuated at dawn and when they tried to occupy another Great Apple Park.
Hundreds of protesters flocked in front of Zuccotti Square, where they wanted access through a court order that allowed the "indigestors" to camp again in this place, while the other side of the movement responded to the evacuation by occupying a park further north of the city, where there were new arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp again in place, we will settle in another place and continue the legal struggle to return to Zuccotti, and through sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," says one of the spokespersons of the "Occupy Wall Street" movement, Mark Bray.
Bray detailed that the response of the 'indigestion' to the evacuation of their camp personally dictated by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, came to the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting forced evacuation from the camp and allowing protesters to remain in the camp.
In addition, the "indigested" occupied a new park located at the confluence of Canal Street and the Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland tunnel, which unites New York and New Jersey, owned by the Trinity Church parish.
At least for an hour they managed to occupy the place, but after the police moved there and arrested some demonstrators, even though Bray could not confirm the actual figure, ensuring that he had seen some journalists who had also been handcuffed.
The organization ensures that there are hundreds of people who had settled in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders moved in support of the members of the movement and tried to intervene in their behalf before the Police.
In the meantime, Zuccotti Square - which is a private property chamber - remains closed pending the holding of a judicial hearing scheduled for that Tuesday, during which the legality of the evacuation of this morning must be analysed.
Some demonstrators who had so far been carrying and distributing copies of this court order and even handed it over to the officers who were monitoring the place, which caused 'some small clashes', said Bray, who denounced the fact that some officials had hit the protesters.
The court order prohibits the authorities from evacuating the members of Occupy Wall Street or applying 'laws published after the beginning of the occupation or to prohibit demonstrators from accessing the park again with tents or other properties they used before'.
Mayor Bloomberg pointed out to the press that, because of this court order, the city had suspended the reopening of space to the public and to demonstrators, to whom, however, he warned that local laws do not allow them to settle with tents and sleeping bags.
The city councillor personally defended the evacuation carried out at dawn at Zuccotti Square, an operation during which 200 people were arrested and which was decided because the demonstrators 'violated the law'.
Bloomberg explained that he had ordered to evacuate the place because it became "a place where people did not come to protest, but to violate the laws and in some cases, to do harm to others", because "some stores had been threatened" and residents were afraid "for their quality of life".
"This morning's evacuation at dawn was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is more interested in defending financial interests than those of American workers," added the spokesman for the movement, who accused the mayor of "not respecting freedom of expression".
The leaders of Occupy Wall Street also indicated that they do not think to organize "great actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and trade unions to commemorate the two months of protests, which began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special television program from Noel
Along with Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, she will be on the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" next December 1st
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", rescuer in "Baywatch", rabbit in "Playboy", wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special Canadian TV Christmas program.
Today, the private television channel CTV announced that Anderson, in addition to the "crooner" (balladin) Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, will be released in the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" next December 1, acting a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed images of the television program in which Anderson, also known for the wide Internet broadcast of a private pornographic video in which she appeared with her husband at that time, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appeared dressed as the Virgin Mary by supporting in a nursery a doll representing Jesus.
On the scene, Peters, a famous Canadian Indian actor who recently presented part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" as Joseph.
Along with Anderson and Peters, CTV's special program also presents the Canadian singer Bublé, who married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March, and who is not far from controversy.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian "whore" during one of her concerts in New York City.
Japan was returning after the earthquake
GDP increases by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the downward spiral of early March
Since March the Japanese economy had been paralyzed, convalescent again after the devastating earthquake that has become the nuclear crisis, the worst disaster in Japan since World War II.
The Government of Tokyo's first estimates calculated material losses at $300,000 million, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, appears to have diminished.
After three consecutive quarters of falls, data from the Gross Domestic Product between July and September were used to turn the page permanently: GDP increased 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% at annualized rates.
The second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also assumes the highest rate of increase from January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly due to the resumption of equipment acquisitions to restore areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1%, compared to the decrease of 0.9% of the capital expenditure observed from January to March, the first decrease after six months of uninterrupted increase.
However, the real incentive of the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Keynesian impulse that invites to take advantage of the crisis to consolidate - or rebuild - infrastructure, use gaps to cross zero.
Japan has woken up mainly because of the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, driven by increased expenditure on vehicles, travel and entertainment activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo has returned to the internal market when the yen - the Japanese currency - has become one of the "refuge values" elected by investors fleeing the debt crisis in the eurozone and the disturbing forecasts of the United States, a privilege that weighs like a slab in the accounts of the exporting companies.
With a stronger divide, products are more expensive abroad, a serious reverse for a country whose economic float line is determined by the health of the major technological groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, were responsible for their weak results between July and September for the contribution of the yen.
While markets continue to sit in EU peripheral countries, the Yoshihiko Noda Government does not lower custody.
"It is necessary to monitor the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of certain foreign economies, the impact of Thailand's floods and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said Motohisa Furukawa, Secretary of State for Economic Policy yesterday.
And indeed, prospects are not encouraging at all.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) noted that the majority of member countries presented clearer signals of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates the inflection points of the world economy has highlighted that the main powers are hampered.
Because it dropped four decimals to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
Eurozone has even been below the average, which is at level 100, not lowering eight decimal places up to 99.13 points.
Athens feeds doubts again
Papadimos says the adjustments will be approved, but the Conservatives will not sign any written commitment
With the peripheral risk premiums triggered and the uncertainty resettled in the parks, Greece continues to get involved in the labyrinth leading to the outbreak of the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Greek Transitional Government is rather imposed by the requirements of Brussels than by a genuine conviction of the political forces begins to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos reported yesterday that there is no alternative for structural reforms and that the 100-day period established in his appointment may be short to apply them, the leader of the Conservative Party New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would not support the new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections for the planned date, that of February 19.
"The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the 26 October summit," Papadimos said when he opened a parliamentary debate yesterday that will end tomorrow with a vote of confidence for the new Executive.
A package of 24 programs to stimulate employment, reform of the disciplinary code of officials and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras' message does not express any doubt about his position: "We have committed ourselves to helping the Transitional Government, but we have not committed ourselves to anything else."
The conservative leader went one step further in his pulse than the EU and the IMF, the agencies that need to unlock the 8,000 million that Athens urgently needs, and said clearly that he will not approve any letter of commitment to make adjustments.
But the European Commission, still irritated by the impact of the referendum of Papandreu, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not unlock the aid if the new Government and the leaders of the main Hellenic parties do not sign "a written commitment without ambiguities as soon as possible".
The spokesperson for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the Troika inspectors would return "very quickly" to Athens to discuss with the new Government "the necessary elements to pay the sixth instalment" of 8,000 million, even if there is no final date either.
The Greeks still have a lot to do.
Queen Sofía: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen points out Spain's "preponderant" place with regard to this type of finance
Spain "has reached a dominant place at the global level in the role of Microfinance".
Queen Sofía recalled that in the last two decades the country has become the second donor of the planet with regard to this instrument of cooperation whose "fuel" lies in the fact that it is an "tool for social progress, justice and hope in a better future for all humanity, based on trust in the human being".
The Queen opened yesterday the Fifth World Summit of Microcredit in Valladolid with the certainty that "there is no doubt" that these types of operations are "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the Millennium Goals established by the United Nations for 2015, and "very specifically, in that it aims to reduce to half the volume of people living with income under one dollar per day, to which the "soil of poverty" is set.
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "in all parts of the world, and assumes this task with "responsibility", said Queen Sofía, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions originating during the Summit, which will extend until Thursday, "ensure the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women", the main beneficiaries of these loans.
We have "reached many goals" and "we face many challenges".
The Microcredit Summit is seen not only as a forum for debate, but also as the platform from which "two basic goals" must be promoted.
For example, Her Majesty explained that the goal is that at the end of 2015 there are 175 million poor families who have access to these financial services and that 100 million of these families come out of the poverty line where they now live.
The impulse in the design of microcredit in Spain and the rest of the world "followed the path initiated a few years ago in a pioneering manner" by Muhammad Yunus, stressed Queen Sofía as an "act of justice and due recognition".
And she described the father of this instrument as an "admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", the work she had known since 15 years ago, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to get to know her lending policy on the ground.
This experience was followed one year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "at each meeting I was able to see a continuous evolution," said Her Majesty, whose relationship with this project brought him yesterday the qualification of "head of family" meeting in Valladolid on the part of the "banker of the poor".
Finally, Queen Sofía ended her intervention by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for any democratic state.
In this regard, she explained that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries at times of economic prosperity, since it is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez considered that microcredit requires "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to poverty eradication", and now "more than ever" developed country governments must work under solidarity criteria and not let it be the victim of compressions.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded "the success" of giving "confidence" to the people "excluded from which all the doors are closed"; and Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present in a city that "opens its gates contaminated with the solidarity spirit".
The CDU proposes to elect the European President to universal suffrage
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Monday, November 14, in Leipzig, was without real difficulty for Angela Merkel, Chancellor but also president of the Christian Democratic Party.
Europe's future was not initially foreseen in the programme but was established in the fall, particularly in order to satisfy the militants who judge the policy of the government too lax towards the Greeks today and perhaps the Italians tomorrow.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the management, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The standing ovation of several minutes to which they were entitled, following their interventions, Angela Merkel then, a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the very European minister of finance, left no room for doubt.
The idea of the chancellor - and the motion - holds in a slogan: the response to the crisis "is not less Europe but more Europe".
Not only because Europe is peace but because 'nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro'.
For chancellor, "time has come from a breakthrough in Europe".
This could result in amendments to the Treaty of Lisbon to strengthen the control of the European Union over the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, but it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission to the universal suffrage "to give Europe a face".
This is in any case one of the motions adopted by the Congress whose inspiration is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
Of course, it is unlikely that the Twenty-Sevens will agree quickly on this revolution: Britain is hostile to it and the leaders of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is also hostile.
But the stake is set.
Likewise, delegates rejected a overwhelming majority of the proposal to place the weight of each country on the European Central Bank's board based on the weight of each economy, which obviously strengthened Germany's weight.
In order to calm the climate within her party, the chancellor has multiplied the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl But neither has she sought to win her congress on the back of the "small" European countries or countries in difficulty ready to criticize the arrogant Germany.
If the motion on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Except in crevices.
Remembering that two centuries ago, Leipzig had been at the heart of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonian army.
What does the fraud at the disease arrests represent?
After allocations, the UMP and the government launched the disease arrest offensive.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be Tuesday, November 15 in Bordeaux to visit a family allowance fund, and to give a speech on the theme - which has been recurring since 2007 - of the fight against social fraud and assisteeship.
And in order to accompany this offensive, which starts from a desire to make savings in a rigorous context, but is no less announcing an axis of the presidential campaign on the right, the majority want to focus on the disease arrests.
First of all, for budgetary savings: the government is planning to impose a fourth day's shortage on private employees before taking care of a work order.
Clearly, without a specific business agreement, a sick employee would lose four days' wages, so at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that could provoke anger, but which would bring back 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
And that would be accompanied by another measure, of a more symbolic scope: to impose a day of unpaid deficiency on officials in the event of a cessation of work (they have so far no time limit of deficiency, compared to three days in the private).
While these issues are under discussion, the majority is also relaunching the issue of fraud, targeting the abuses associated with the arrests.
"Controls will be much more important and, in addition, if you are taken, you will repay," warned Xavier Bertrand at RTL micro on Sunday, November 13.
As in other cases, the effects of the announcement seem somewhat disproportionate to the reality of fraud at work.
This has been the subject of constant follow-up and political offensives since 2002, most often bearing their fruit.
The French are not sicker than elsewhere in Europe.
Let us first look at national figures.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (NCAM), more than EUR 237 million of daily allowances were issued in 2006.
According to the Institute for Health Economic Research and Documentation, daily allowances accounted for 5% of health expenditure in 2008 with EUR 11.3 billion.
Of this amount, 46% concerned maternity leave and work accidents, and 54% concerned sick leave, or 6.2 billion euros.
So 2.5% of health expenditures.
In 2010, the French experienced an average of 14.5 days of cessation of work, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
An average that hides certain deviations: another survey, published in 2007 by the Monster.com Career Management Site, showed that 75% of the 40 000 French employees interviewed said they had not taken any days of medical arrest.
Another study, this time of sickness insurance , states that in 2010, 37% of medical arrests were less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to one month, 15% from one to three months and 11% beyond.
When compared with their European neighbours, the French employees are no longer more inclined than they are to the workplaces.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall absence rate (for health reasons or not) was between 10% and 11% in France, compared with 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Fraud at medical arrests is very little compared to work in the dark.
In terms of fraud, it only reaches a small extent.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has resulted in systematic checks on medical arrests of more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million controls, CNAM found that 13% of the 285,000 made for short-term arrests were "unjustified or too long", or 37,050 cases.
In the case of arrests of more than 45 days, systematically controlled, 11% of the cases were "unadapted or unwarranted" over 1.2 million, i.e. 132 000.
In total, 169,000 "unjustified" cases, out of several million employees who had a sick leave.
A figure that represents very little face, for example, to that of work in black.
According to MP UMP Dominique Tian, author of a report on this issue in June, it would represent 9 to 15 billion euros of tax deficit per year, more than the total cost of daily allowances, and therefore infinitely more than the fraud to the latter.
Papademos: Greece will have to implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment programme to restore its economy.
This is what Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos said before Parliament on Monday, 14 November, adding that the 100 days given to his union government would not be enough to accomplish this task.
"To continue efforts to restore the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme," said the Head of Government, who made his first public address at the opening of the debate on the vote on trust in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the euro area summit on 27 October will be the "main task" of the new government, as the country's participation in the euro area "is at stake", he added.
As a result, Mr. Papademos predicted that the country's public deficit would be reduced "around 9%" of GDP by the end of the year, after being 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right refuses new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right, gave his support on Monday to the measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis but warned that his party would not commit itself to an additional austerity.
"We will not vote for new measures," he said at a meeting with his party's Members, New Democracy.
He agreed with the objectives of reducing deficit and debt, and combating waste but hostile to any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
In Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not release the loan of EUR 8 billion needed without written guarantee from all parties that they would support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his word was sufficient and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
Euthanasia and assisted suicide must be legalized, said a committee of experts
Canadians live in denial of death, according to the Royal Society of Canada report
With regard to palliative care, the Committee calls for governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure better palliative care, beyond cancer.
Canadian society lives in denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians accept to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make arrangements for that purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an imposing report by the Royal Society of Canada, involving six experts in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
This committee recommends that the government amend the Criminal Code so as to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, where necessary, to a patient who is deemed competent to make such a decision.
At the start of the game, experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries on the planet.
If Canada ranked 10th, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has generated a culture in which people are afraid to address the subject of death."
Medicization or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, report experts mandated by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the wish most Canadians have to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying at the hospital.
Overall, in Quebec, this rate is the highest, with 86% of the deaths occurring in the hospital.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that are contrary to the federal government's position, which has already said that they want nothing to change to the Criminal Code on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to experts, who have also reviewed all countries where these approaches are legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization leads to abuse in the application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide on non-competent or unconsenting persons.
On the contrary, he said yesterday in teleconference Jocelyn Downie, co-sponsor of the report, there would be more cases of these overflows precisely in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
"Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal," Jocelyn Downie explains.
Canadians in favor of euthanasia
Recall that 85% of Canadians have already voted in favour of euthanasia because they believe that it would allow end-of-life people to alleviate their suffering, according to an Angus Reid survey conducted in 2010.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not have the effect of sending the message that the lives of older or disabled people are less valuable.
As for those who have committed assisted suicide, the respondents estimate that 41% should not be prosecuted.
With regard to the maintenance or cessation of care with a patient, the situation is less clear, says the authors of the report.
Therefore, in the list of their recommendations, they suggest that it should be indicated in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of care for which there has been a legally valid refusal is not criminal.
The Committee of Experts also requests that health professionals be trained to respect a refusal of end-of-life care without fear of criminal prosecution.
With regard to palliative care, the Committee calls for governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure better palliative care, beyond cancer.
Finally, in terms of palliative or terminal sedation, already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the Committee requests that it be considered, when it is not used to reduce physical pain, such as euthanasia, and that it is subject to the same procedures.
Reserves from other experts
Some health law experts have already made reservations regarding the findings of the report of the Royal Society of Canada experts.
Me Pierre Deschamps, a health law specialist, described as "extreme" the position of the experts who signed the report, among other things because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia to patients in terminal stages.
"This opens the door to a situation where everyone who would be tired of life and who would be over 18 could ask for help to commit suicide," says Me Deschamps, who had consulted yesterday a summary of the report.
Me Deschamps also points out that the authors of the report seem to place the person's autonomy above all other values that participate in the social fabric of society.
But, "in society, he says, there are beacons and constraints."
The health law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed "a strong opposition" to the findings of the report, which she called "pro-euthanasia manifesto".
Margaret Somerville, herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, in particular challenges the report's data on the absence of abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, both in the Netherlands and Oregon.
King of Jordan calls on President Assad to leave power
Ladies denounces a "combat"
Syria is becoming increasingly isolated
Bachar al-Assad supporters demonstrated yesterday at the premises of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Diplomatic pressure intensified yesterday on the Syria of Bachar al-Assad, who, with the support of Russia, resists them and denounces a "competence" against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union strengthened its sanctions against Damascus while Turkey and Jordan, neighbours of Syria, took a stand for the departure of President Assad.
King Abdallah II of Jordan was yesterday the first Arab leader to call on President Bachar al-Assad to "let go of power" in Syria where about forty civilians and members of the regime forces were still killed.
"If Bachar was in the interest of his country, he should resign, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," said the King of Jordan, a country neighbouring Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
For his part, the leader of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, regretted that Turkish mediation efforts undertaken since the beginning of the year under the Syrian regime had failed.
"Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said, alluding to Syria, a neighbouring country where Turkey adopts an increasingly tough line.
The United States welcomed the "strengthening of consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime" following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League, countries like Turkey adopt an increasingly harsh tone" in the face of repression in Syria, noted Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime forces perished in the Deraa region in southern Syria, announced the Syrian Human Rights Observatory (SHR).
Two other civilians perished "on the exchange of gunshots and heavy machine guns at Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, according to this NGO.
At a press conference, however, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem felt that the country was "facing towards the end of the crisis".
He also reacted strongly to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus from its work, which he felt was a "dangerous step".
Syria "will not bend," he added, ensuring that "the evil plot against Syria will fail."
Following its decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now studying a "civil protection mechanism" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
The French Minister for Foreign Affairs Alain Juppé also expressed his support for sending United Nations observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime which he believed is confined to the "paranoia".
A further extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled to be held tomorrow in Rabat to take stock of the implementation of the crisis exit plan decided on 2 November, including the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities facing the protest and release of the arrested protesters.
The Russian Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, judged yesterday "uncorrect" the Arab League's decision, while China urged Syria to implement the crisis exit plan while maintaining its support for possible sanctions against Damascus.

Monti demands time for markets and sacrifices for Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has called for some time in the markets to form his team and implement a program, which will contain "sacrifices", in order to recover the credibility lost in the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner was in discussion with the political parties yesterday before meeting with trade unions and employers today.
It should establish a relatively small cabinet composed of external technocrats in Parliament.
"Monti has talked about an important programme with many sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many small parliamentary groups involved in the interviews, after meeting with the President of the Council appointed.
The President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, said he expected Mario Monti to request a vote of confidence in Parliament by Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultations will conclude with Mr. Monti's presentation of a limited list, probably of a dozen ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monti commented on the nervousness of the stock markets yesterday, asking for time.
In "democracy, there are precise deadlines" to prepare a government and its program, he stressed, saying "certain that the markets will be patient and understand".
Its designation by the President had initially been welcomed by the markets, but the concern resumed especially after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The prime minister appointed should be a team that includes, above all, technocrats, even though he stressed that he would like to include "politics".
The new government is expected to last until 2013, the date of the next legislation, he said.
According to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will gain Parliament's confidence by Friday.
Mr Monti committed himself, once he came into office, to work in the emergency and for the purpose that Italy "becomes a protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesperson for European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change".
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its budgetary balance objective in 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, has called for, inter alia, further rigorous measures.
The Italian patron saint Emma Marcegaglia, who will see him Tuesday, also stressed the need to reinvigorate the economy, "because a country that has no growth cannot meet the deficit parameters".
Mr Monti, renowned for his competence and independence as a European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "change of time" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism", the "professor" symbolizing "the challenge of serious" and another "Italy", according to editorialists.
The great unknown will be the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy must place 200 billion euros of state obligations by April 2012.
A Russian scientist helped Iran's nuclear programme
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, helped Iran develop a usable detonator with a nuclear weapon, said on Monday an American NGO specializing in atomic risk.
The Institute for International Science and Security (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Security Agency (IAEA) and other documents from this United Nations agency to identify this researcher.
The IAEA reported last week its "serious concerns" about the "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to ISIS, which was widely used in IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko, born in 1934, worked for three decades from the 1960s in a Soviet military nuclear centre in Cheliabinsk (Ural), and was allegedly involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the centre to establish a company producing "nano-diamonds" in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his company would have led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He would then have cooperated with the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002 before his return to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA refers to "high indications that the development by Iran of a nuclear detonation system "has been assisted by the work of a foreign expert, who was not only familiar with this technique, but who, as a Member State has informed the Agency, has worked during most of his career on this technology within the military nuclear programme of his country of origin".
Anti-Muslim crimes and crimes increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims increased by nearly 50% from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time other racial and religious violence decreased slightly or little, according to FBI statistics made public on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of violence against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, 49 per cent, compared to a 13 per cent increase in violence against Catholics, a 4 per cent decrease in crimes against Jews and a global increase of 14 per cent in anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of "hate crimes" increased very slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by race differences and 20% by religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and crimes increase again," said the human rights organization Human rights First, "the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant," the organization added in a communiqué.
"Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be regarded as a serious violation of human rights," added one of the organization's leaders, Paul Legendre.
"The U.S. government can and must do more to tackle these abuses," he said, thinking that this could happen by improving police reports on "hate crimes".
The "crime of hate" in U.S. federal law is an inheritance of the time of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation had been adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violence related to race, colour of skin, religion, origin and now sexual belonging.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The micro-blogging Twitter site introduced changes on Monday in the presentation of its platform, in particular to allow its users to observe the activity of those they follow, which makes its service somewhat more similar to that of Facebook.
A new "activity" tab and another "name" tab allow you to read more, live the activity of the other "Twittos", the netizens who follow the messages ("tweets") and those who follow you.
This lets you know if they follow messages, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they have favorite messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "on a small percentage of users in August" before being broadcast throughout the network on Monday, indicated to the AFP the spokesperson for Twitter, Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was known for its instinctive operation, with somewhat esoteric terms (RT to recast someone else's message, #followfriday to recommend follow another user) making the happiness of the initiators, thus opens to a wider audience with a more comparable handling than that of the public networks Facebook and Google+.
On the network, users were discussing tweets on the interest of this innovation.
"It's useless, invasive, and it looks too much like Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"Activity functionality will help me better track certain elements of my Twitter stream," @dannykronstrom sent.
Austria
inclusion of a budgetary "gold rule" in the Constitution
The government of the great Social-Democrat/Christian coalition in Austria decided on Tuesday to include in the constitution a "gold rule" to reduce public deficits so as to avoid possible degradation by the rating agencies of the sovereign note of Austria (Triple A).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who himself announced this decision following a Council of Ministers, while the Austrian public debt is 74.6%, largely above the criterion of a maximum of 60% laid down in the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency was reduced only by one cran, from AAA to AA+, we should pay three billion euros of interest extra every year," argued the Deputy Chancellor and Christian Democratic Minister for Foreign Affairs, Michael Spindelegger.
Austria thus follows a request from the Brussels Summit of the euro area member countries of 26 October: the Heads of State or Government had then demanded the inclusion by the end of 2012 of the reduction of public deficits and a return to the balance of public accounts in the constitution or in a law of the same value.
The arrangements adopted by the Austrian Government are close to the "German model", since Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the structural government deficit will have to decrease by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year and, starting in 2017, the federal government's structural government deficit will not have to exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while regional states and municipalities will have to present balanced budgets.
The objective is to bring public debt under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty to 2020/21.
Strong Yen
The threat of new intervention on the foreign exchange market
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would intervene again on the foreign exchange market if the yen continued to rise.
"We will intervene as we did the last time if we see excessive volatility" in the yen's exchange rate," explained Mr.Noda in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen was not far from the historical levels which led the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo sold massive yen against dollars in order to lower the value of the Japanese currency that had just established a new record of vigor since 1945 in front of the green ticket.
But the yen has been regularly rebounded since, dominated by purchases of investors who regard it as a "refuge value" in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar is spent on Tuesday under 77 yen and the euro is lowered under the symbolic bar of 105 yen, near the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was worth around 120 yen and the euro was more than 160 yen.
This fluctuation in the Japanese currency is detrimental to the exports of the archipelago because it costs the cost of Made in Japan products and reduces the value of revenues from outside Japan's companies when they convert them into national currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild itself" since the earthquake and tsunami of 11 March that devastated the Tohoku region (north-east), he stressed that he feared that this increase in Yen would not kill in the egg the fragile recovery.
The third world economic power renewed with growth in the third quarter - 1.5% compared to the previous quarter - for the first time in a year, thanks to a surge in the exports and consumption of households affected by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister found that Yen's worth was not "the economic fundamentals of Japan".
The Minister of Finance, Jun Azumi, for his part, called the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened on Tuesday a two-day meeting of his monetary policy board, to take all possible steps to weaken the yen.
But the deputy governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken "the appropriate measures", suggesting that no additional monetary relief was to be expected Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the issuing institute increased its purchases of Treasury bonds by €5,000 billion (€47 billion) to €55 billion (€519 billion) the ceiling of the amounts it spends on purchases of various financial instruments to flood the liquidity market.
Euro area:
Rates rise, Stock Exchanges flanche
The risk of contagion of the debt crisis still undermines European indices.
Despite the designation of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of fragile countries continue to rise.
Still concerned about the stability of the euro area, the European Stock Exchanges went a little further into negative territory on Tuesday, 15 November.
In Paris, at 10h, the CAC 40 loses 1.4% to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt yields 0.4% and London 0.1%.
"With the new tensions over the yields of euro-zone borrowings in difficulty, stock markets around the world continue to make part of their recent gains ".
"The investors, nervous, are only too aware of the risk of contagion," explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters Agency.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed by 0.7%, in turn suffering from renewed fears from market players about Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has eyes on Europe and exchanges will continue in a narrow corridor of changes as long as investors do not have evidence that the situation is stabilised," says Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This renewed concern about the future of the euro area penalizes the single currency, which continues to decline on Tuesday.
The euro has been evolving at its lowest level for a month and a half.
At around 10 a.m., the European currency is worth $1,3570, reflecting 0.4%.
According to the brokers, it withdrew after the chancellor Angela Merkel's party, the CDU, meeting in Congress on Monday, adopted a motion providing, inter alia, the possibility for a country in difficulty to leave the euro area without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates well above 6%
The borrowing rates for Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
This Tuesday morning, the performance of the 10-year Italian bonds reached 6.85%, that of the Spanish titles at the same maturity 6.2%.
These tensions on the interest rates of the southern countries, as well as in France, continue to fuel the concerns of the stakeholders.
The head of the future Italian government Mario Monti has demanded time from the markets to restore the situation in Italy, threatened with asphyxiation by the weight of his debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos stated that the implementation of the decisions taken at the euro area summit on 27 October would be the "main task" of his government.
Spain is in the target line of markets, while there are Sunday legislative elections in the country.
The rate gap ("spread") between the 10-year bonds of Germany and Spain has reached a new history.
Waiting for growth figures in the euro area
With regard to statistics, France recorded an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than the expected 0.3%, brought by household consumption.
However, the Insee revised the second quarter figure, with a decrease of 0.1% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
And, indeed, it is the fourth most worrying economists.
Germany, for its part, recorded 0.5% growth over the same period.
A first estimate for the euro area as a whole is expected at 11 a.m. while the European Commission has just warned against the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
the facts must prevail over the dogmas
If it is a matter that cannot be dealt with from short-term considerations or under emotion, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and competitiveness of businesses.
It is healthy that an election meeting should be an opportunity to reflect on such issues and the place that nuclear has in them.
The debate will only be fruitful if it explores all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the options proposed.
The French must base their views on objective facts, rational data.
While we are 7 billion "human beings on the planet, the demographic evolution will double the demand for electricity by 2050, unless we deprive a large part of the world's population of a vital element.
At the same time, it will be necessary to reduce the re-reflation of fossil resources in order to continue to produce constant electricity, not forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate imbalance, a matter that has disappeared from the environmental debate.
Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains isolated in its decision to give up nuclear.
It is neither Belgium nor Belgium, which submits its own to the need to be able to find a replacement source capable of replacing itself, nor Switzerland, which simply intends to build only state-of-the-art plants.
On the other hand, Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote only them, continue their projects with determination.
The United States, they, decided after Fukushima to add a unit to their park by restarting the construction of a interrupted power station after the Three Mile Island accident.
If the German model, focused on renewable energies, is sometimes presented as an example, reality contradicts speech.
The choice of Berlin will result in an increase in the price of electricity, an increase in energy dependence exacerbated by the increased use of imported gas, particularly from Russia, a rise in CO2 emissions caused by the construction of gas and coal power plants.
In a few months, all these ugly effects have already been felt.
The case of Denmark is to be pondered.
The European Wind Champion, whose 30% of its electricity, is also one of the largest users of coal and gas due to intermittent wind; hence, its CO2 emissions and its electricity price are 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the other hand, thanks to the consistent energy policy, our neighbours pay a electricity bill of 40% higher than that of French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of maintaining the industrial tool in the national territory, French companies benefit from the least expensive electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction on the part of nuclear power would result in a strong increase in electricity prices, which would make illusory the beautiful declarations on the reindustrialization of our country and the defence of purchasing power.
A price that a large majority of French refuse to pay, so much so that they do not manifest any opposition in principle to this energy, polls show it.
Let us remember that our country's energy policy has built an industrial line of 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 induced jobs.
Strongly exporting, it leads to a galaxy of specialised SMEs in international markets and makes them very creators of non-removable jobs.
If France had just decided to get out of the nuclear power station, it would have sacrificed many of these SMEs by reducing the annual 6 billion euros of French exports of nuclear equipment and services as a skin of grief.
Which electrician would command an EPR designed to function sixty years while the decline of its manufacturer would be programmed?
To solve the energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no source of miraculous electricity production, no more than there is no devilish.
The development by Areva of low-emitting solutions of nuclear and renewable CO2, reflects the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear, maintaining the highest level of safety is an absolute imperative.
In France we have a Safety Authority that exercises intransigent and transparent control over existing plants as on the Flamenville site.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, are inhabited by the same security obsession.
In the mid-century, the nuclear industry suffered three serious accidents.
One, Three Mile Island, intervened under normal operating conditions; it remained without human or environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, the design of the reactor and unforgivable human faults caused the drama.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident resulted from two natural disasters of an unprecedented magnitude that caused the deaths of tens of thousands.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident, as it had done for the previous two.
As a result of this approach and cooperation between the security authorities, operators and French and German manufacturers, the EPR presents a design enabling it to withstand such phenomena.
While it is considered by all electricians eager to build a power plant, stopping its construction in Flamenville would be a beautiful gift offered to competitors in Areva and EDF by leaving them the free way to take leadership in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is essential and legitimate to look for the best energy package for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the emotions, dogmas and partisan manoeuvres dominate such a debate that determines the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy carried out under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticised in various ways -the extent of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the figure policy, the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of "human rights countries" of France.
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students who have made the news, the Minister of the Interior (read Release of May 23) proclaiming in the passage that France "does not need foreign talents, Masons and restaurant servers".
But it is only rarely analyzed from an economic point of view.
There is a fairly broad consensus between the left and the right on this subject.
On the right, the tone was given by Jacques Chirac, who declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed people should not be a problem in a country with almost 2 million migrant workers", and on the left, by Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot accept all the misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, fear of the invasion of the national territory by Polish plumber hordes was shared on both the left and the right.
For both sides, immigrants are perceived as a burden for the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity that will be denied to immigrants.
In his program, François Hollande is confined to trivialities, indicating that co-development will solve our "migratory problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, is perhaps electorally paid; but it is very expensive economically.
As noted by economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in a recent paper summarizing the latest knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among experts on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
Restricting immigration anemia growth and losing jobs.
Fears of the impact of migrants are based on the idea that they may replace national workers, particularly those who are less qualified, with downward pressure on their wages.
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are much more complementary than substitutes for national employees, performing mostly trades in sectors with a shortage of jobs.
Unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national employees, and those that are most qualified in dynamic sectors where training does not follow the offer of jobs.
A positive effect on wages
In the same way that a surgeon will have a hard time working in a country where there is a shortage of anesthetics, these complementaryities between nationals and migrants make immigrant arrivals have a positive effect on the wages and employment of nationals.
Giovanni Peri has thus calculated that an increase of 1% of migration flows results in an increase between 0.6 and 0.9% of real long-term wages.
And this does not take into account the fact that the diversity provided by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (a strong proportion of naturalised immigrants among the American Nobel Prizes; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems, on average up to 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The World Labour Organization, for example, estimates that an immigrant in Germany at the age of 30 will make a net contribution (receiving less expenditure) of EUR 150,000 to public budgets on average throughout his life.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted, at the beginning of his term of office, to look for the missing growth points "with the teeth".
The teeth in question, serving as a deterrent to immigrants, have had the exact opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, it remains to think about European democracy
Democracy is a valuable asset; it is also a fragile asset.
The European continent should be able to remember it which, to have invented it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, experienced throughout the twentieth century the tragedies of the Great War, totalitarianisms, the Holocaust, the goulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some have been able to believe that democracy would be sufficient to finally triumph over its enemies, to exercise the vote, and to exercise it in the most direct manner.
It is known from Napoleon "the Little One", that this was an easy thought.
Universal suffrage, in order to be the necessary condition of democracy, is not sufficient and can even become "an instrument of oppression" as Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, separation and control of powers, education, lights, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis in Europe that we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it is also and first of all a crisis of politics and democracy.
The palinody of the true Greek referendum has in this respect had a value of double revelation: that of the need for a powerful return of politics, but also that of the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
This ambivalence must be thought to be exceeded.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have now moved away, and for many of them, the Republican soldiers are no longer pulling in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain from demanding a succession of national referendums, organized according to needs and in scattered order.
A white-seing to the absolute European monarch or a foot jump attached to the gap of the nationalist reply: what a choice for the citizen!
No, we do not want couperets but we do want a common, full-right, serene and continuous exercise of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - there is no longer any place to stop the list - because there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is Europe as a whole that leans on the dictatorships of the markets and rating agencies, which suffer from its impotence and its lack of solidarity.
Europe as a whole is humiliated on the international stage.
We are concerned about transfers of sovereignty to Europe - but it is Europe as a whole that slowly loses its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The urgent need is to restore the pilotage of the European project to popular sovereignty.
Because it is together that Europeans can reduce the burden of their debts, free themselves from markets and prepare for the future by investing.
The outcome of the crisis will require decisions at European level that cannot be taken without complete democratic legitimacy, except of course to lead us to disaster.
After a long struggle with this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone today calls for the European economic government.
Seven.
But thinking about it without stronger political and democratic integration, and living as such by citizens, would be a new madness and a new impasse.
We must take on a new stage of European construction.
To make the Republic in France, it was necessary to "make" the Republicans.
The revolution in interest could not suffice.
This lesson remains valid.
We must build a more integrated Europe economically.
This can only be done by building a more democratic Europe politically, a genuine European people's sovereignty.
To make Europe, let's make Europeans.
"No contact" chip cards are generalized
The world exhibition of the chip map opens Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, in an optimistic climate.
The year 2011 is expected to end with an 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor cards (bank card, SIM card telephone...), to more than 6 billion units, according to Eurosmart firm.
The most powerful segment is that of contactless technology that allows you to pay for public transport or adjust your purchases by simply approaching a reader's card.
This year, 460 million contactless chip cards should be sold worldwide, compared to 320 million a year earlier!
Their share is expected to make further progress in 2012 (580 million units expected) and represent almost 10% of the overall chip card market (6,925 million cards).
In the long run to the Asian-Pacific region, Europe is gaining ground for non-contact payment.
Some 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this functionality and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 cards without contact Visa have been deployed.
But the big surfaces put the double bolts.
Carrefour issued this year 2.5 million Pass MasterCard cards without contact.
To move to higher speed, banks now need to equip their customers.
"Two large French institutions have committed themselves to systematically broadcast to their customers bank cards equipped for contactless use in the future," says Gérard Nebouy, Director General Visa Europe France.
Banks Test Mobile Payment
But it is only a first step towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
Few devices are now equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology that is essential for conducting transactions.
"They're late."
"But they should finally know a real growth next year."
"We are tabling the sale of 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012," explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the lead.
The Agricultural Credit announced yesterday the launch of a test from December to June next in Caen.
The iPhones of about 200 customers and collaborators will be equipped with a case permitting contact-free payment.
The CPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the General Society, too, said yesterday to prepare for the placing on the market of an offer allowing its customers to pay without contact with their mobile.
From Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front extends
Paris is concerned about the link between al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long suspected links between the al-Qaida terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram are confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs Abdelkader Messahel even claimed that Algiers has now "acquired certainty".
"The way the two organizations operate and the intelligence service reports show that there is good cooperation," he explained without further clarification.
Paris seems to be doing a similar analysis.
The survey of the abduction of two Frenchmen in Niger last January would have brought to light the gateways.
Kidnapped to a restaurant in Niamey by relatives of Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the following day along with several of their captors during an operation launched by the French special forces.
In the aftermath of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators had to find several telephone chips belonging to terrorists.
Terrorist Axis
The analysis of past calls is aimed at several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two issues are of particular interest to investigators: one leads to a Nigerian who has stayed long in Maiduguri, a town in northern Nigeria, Boko Haram's cradle and the other to a man who is near Aqmi and the sect.
"It is an advance but we must probably wait for more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"It has been known for years that the sect has received external financial and intellectual support and has been increasingly active," says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months these "supports" have been increasingly evident in the evolution and speeches of Boko Haram or in its operating modes, which now involve the use of increasingly complex kamikazes or explosive devices and of the same invoice as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has therefore put pressure on Abuja to take account of the problems posed by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have long considered the group to be a community of illuminators of little interest.
A quick hit
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist imman Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which means in haoussa "Western education is a sin" - advocates the establishment of an Islamic Emirates in northern Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is rapidly successful.
It is politicizing and demanding strict respect for the sharia while its militants engage in the fight against the impie central government.
The latter focus first on churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram's militants were particularly active, increasing the number of attacks against the police stations.
Abuja's reaction is, as usual, without nuances.
The army invests in the city, there are 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested alive, is killed in prison.
Hence the sect will radicalize and leave its fiefs from the north.
Last Christmas, she claims an attack that kills 80 people in Jos, then another one in Abuja.
In June, it was still in Abuja that Boko Haram took over at the police's secure QG during a suicide attack, his first.
In August, the United Nations local headquarters will be its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa that would sail from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria now worries all security specialists.
While Aqmi invested Mali and Niger, which the Somalis of al-Kebab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears to be a new threat to the heart of the continent.
Last week, during an interview in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned against Boko Haram and said he was "ready to share all the information."
The World According to Republican Candidates to the Presidency
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete with simplicity and ignorance.
Can a crisis-stricken America manage a complex world with simple, even simplistic ideas?
To listen to Republican presidential candidates, voters might believe that.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the others have been multiplying the tignatory statements and shortenings in foreign policy, traditionally a strong republican point.
On China, on Iran, on Israel's aid, slogans - often unsubstantiated - are coming together.
Mitt Romney, the best placed in the race for the appointment of the "Great Old Party", threatened to drag the Chinese to the WTO and challenge them "for the manipulation of their currency", a theme which is a theme in America which is exacerbated by the migration of whole fish from their industry to Asia.
So much so if it must involve the triggering of a commercial war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Ambassador to Obama China and only candidate for a sophisticated foreign policy vision, has failed to strangle himself in the face of an attitude that "flashes" emotions.
He called for a muscular but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama's current position).
But Huntsman, standing in the depths of the surveys, remains audible.
In the image of Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions failed to stop its nuclear program.
"If I'm elected, I'll stop Iran, did he brag."
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll have the bomb."
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to meet his obligations to this partner.
Herman Cain, the second best-placed candidate, has a embarrassing misconception of his records.
Recently, he called against the Chinese military threat because Beijing "is trying to develop nuclear capacity" - apparently ignorant of the fact that China has owned the military atom since 1964!
Texan Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants strikes against Iran, said he was ready to commit the U.S. Army to Mexico against drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, prohibited by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
We are far from the 2008 Republican candidate, John McCain, a heavy burden on foreign policy.
The current president's opponents replied that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the cold war.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to put water into his wine in the matter of anti-terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of their naive dialogue with Iran, on the early departure of Iraq's "boys", on its distortions in Libya, thus attaching a weak label to it.
But the attack isn't that easy.
The population is rather positive about Obama's national security balance, which eliminated Ben Laden.
Since Iraq, she has been suspicious of the military interventions that lead to the framing.
And, arguing that America needs to be reconstructed economically to bring its leadership back to life, Obama strikes more justly.
The North Stream, a new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream pipeline, directly connecting Western Europe to Russia through the Baltic Sea, entered into service.
It must provide gas for the equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event brilliantly.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, participated on the Baltic coasts last Tuesday, between orchestra and fine buffet, at the inauguration of the North Stream, this new gas pipeline directly under the sea links Russia to Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte turned together the valve steering the entry of Russian gas into the western European network.
With this new gas pipeline, 27.5 billion cubic metres of extra Russian gas will arrive every year in Western Europe by a first 1.224 km tube connecting the St. Petersburg region to the Mecklemburg-Poméranie Land.
A second tube is due to be completed at the end of 2012 to deliver a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, equivalent to all French consumption.
And we already mention the possibility of building a third on the same route.
For Gazprom, the completion in time and time of this huge construction site has airs of victory.
The project had been strongly challenged by Poland and the Baltic countries.
The North Stream will allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany, avoiding land crossings by a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
All of a sudden, these two countries are losing some of their power: it becomes more difficult for them to weigh on Russia by threatening to close its access to the Western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw had not hesitated to compare the North Stream to a "new German-Soviet pact", in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is whether the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, by supporting this Russian project, has gained greater security of its supplies.
But it is at the price of a weakening of Europe of energy, as the project has created a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
Russia has barely been able to succeed in its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, which are heavily gas consumers, and whose deposits are declining.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that binds us organically," confirmed François Fillon by opening this pipeline, demonstrating the extent to which large gas contracts are both political and economic.
All this explains the wide smiles displayed by the Gazprom leaders, present in numbers in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical exploitation.
The submarine tube is made of concrete-gained steel to protect it from the anchorages of ships.
It is based on the bottom of the sea, at an average of 200 m.
To build it, mine fields from the Second World War had to be avoided.
"A hundred had to be removed or destroyed, by precaution," says Jens Müller, spokesperson for North Stream.
Measures to protect fauna and flora also had to be multiplied.
The tube is a long metal snake, heavy like 242 Eiffel towers, which nothing interrupts over its length: neither valve nor maintenance station.
A control platform was planned off Sweden, but the project managers gave up while the Swedish were reluctant to see a Russian state company permanently settling off their coasts.
"In case of damage, we stop gas flow in less than a minute," says Jens Müller.
In case of leak, therefore, the gas contained in the pipeline escapes into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by the manufacturers who have provided the welding for a leak every 100,000 years.
The monitoring of the state of the pipeline shall be carried out by a submarine robot, carried out by a ship, for external observation, as well as by an aircraft circulating within the pipeline.
From the shape of a cigar, it is introduced inside the tube, wide of a metre diameter, and it is driven by the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at the speed of 3 meters second, it provides accurate information on possible metal deformations.
The pipeline was designed to operate for 50 years without having to undergo any repairs.
The flow of gas is simply ensured by pressure.
It is 200 bars at the beginning, and 100 on arrival.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which keeps 51% of the shares.
The Germans E.ON and BASF (15.5% each) and the Dutch Gasunie and the French GDF Suez group (9% each) joined them.
These five companies have created a joint venture, known as Nord Stream, which is responsible for building and operating the pipeline.
It has its headquarters in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased the company, for 20 renewable years, all gas transport capacity.
"Gazprom will pay for total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas actually transported," says Jens Müller.
The financing of the construction of the pipeline was provided to 30% by shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the work is expected to reach EUR 7.4 billion for both tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, investment amounted to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure to return to their expenses, since only Gazprom assumes the risk.
The gas pipeline emerges from the Baltic to Lubmin, on a sandy coastline planted with pines.
Valves, 4.5 meters high, form the exit door of the gas.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specificities of the gas that occurs before it is transferred into the German pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal receives a million cubic metres of Russian gas every hour that passes.
With full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012, 6 million.
Moleskine, a brand card.
Created about fifteen years ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to re-enact the taste of writing.
He has a scent of adventures, hours spent writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine Carnet is easily recognizable, with its black rectangular cover, its elastic, its leaves of a broken white color, as aged by time.
However, the Moleskine booklet as we know it today was born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a design but distinguished notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then consultant for the company, is responsible for the launch of the new product.
The paper is inspired by an old production technique, the mole skin skin skin, which refers to a varnish cotton used to cover banquets, for example.
This type of book was highly appreciated by writers and travelers.
" Moleskine gave to the taste of the day an old and forgotten object, which was an icon of the avant-garde artists, up to the 20th century," says Maria Sebregondi, who has been responsible for the brand at Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to 12.7 million coins.
We are far from the confidential production of the first few years, where only 3,000 booklets were designed.
Moleskine exceeds the Italian borders and exports to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to establish a portrait-robot of the buyer, as the notebook of notes seduces both the businessman and the student and the professionals.
Like Moleskine, its consumers are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultivated.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees at its beginning, accounts for almost 100 today and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributes her books in the bookstores, from the Fnac to small downtown shops and has been able to impose her identity.
"We have followed the air of time and this new need for writing, despite the rise of emails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand launched an exhibition " Detour " where architects or artists exhibit their own book.
In August, she also launched a leopard cover at the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and cultural aura, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: bags, agenda, pens, computer covers... The brand has declined on a wide range of media.
A success that has made a difference: in the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the SG Capital Europe Investment Fund, now Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in Moleskin's history.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers still so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for work.
The 15th week for the employment of disabled people is opening today.
Despite a voluntary public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate for persons with disabilities is still twice as high as the average: 19%, compared with 9% for the whole population.
Discouragement?
"No, stresses Éric Blanchet, Director General of the Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of disabled people."
" The progress made for 15 years is considerable. "
"At the time, the unemployment rate was not two but three times higher."
" Nevertheless, there is still a great deal to be done. "
It should be said that for the disabled, there are still many obstacles to access to employment.
They are rather older: 37% are over 50 (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% do not have the baccalaureate and of the 2.3 million higher education students, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% for disabled people, compared to 38% on average.
In short, so many criteria that alone complicate the return to employment, and which "are the node of the problem", says Christian Grapin, Director General of Tremplin, an association established in 1992 to help companies recruit disabled workers.
This is for objective brakes.
There remains the unspoken, the attitudes that evolve, of course, but too slowly.
A study carried out in April by the IMS-Entrepreneur for the City indicated that the managers interviewed had "a low level of knowledge of disability", with a "overrepresentation of people in wheelchairs, psychic or intellectual disabilities".
As a result, private enterprises with more than 20 employees are still far from reaching the employment target of 6% of disabled workers, established in a law of... 1987.
The last known figures, dating back to 2008, report a 2.6% ratio.
"We are now around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, Director General of the Agefiph, the agency responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not comply with this law.
Evidence: The number of "taxed" institutions, as well as amounts paid, decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59 000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 million to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Act, which increased contributions, created strong pressure on businesses," explains Pierre Blanc. "
"But this improvement also translates real awareness, especially in large groups."
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of institutions between 20 and 49 employees employ disabled workers, compared with 82% of enterprises from 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "How Happy" · Global Voices
Before confronting the Blues Tuesday evening (20h45) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure that this friendly game gives them.
We're not going to write that there was some connivance between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sit side by side on the platform of the auditorium of Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard did indeed make peace.
Five months after his attacker's mood gesture against Turkey, the Belgian picker has only praise for him.
"I am very pleased with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian."
"I want to move forward," says the Lillois.
As for the contrast between its club and selection benefits, "it's a whole, if it's justified."
"In Lille, I'm there all year long, which is not the case with Belgium."
"I have to take my marks."
Threatened against Romania on Friday evening in view of this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "bright".
However, without forgetting the notion of "pleasir".
The Blues, he has encouraged them since the age of 7 and the winning campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been to bear," he says.
This is strongly involved in further strengthening the "particular" nature of this meeting.
As much as in front of him, "there is Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami), " he remembers.
"We met at the moment."
"The ability to play against them is only happiness!"
With bonhomy, Leekens spoke of the "fierté".
"Pride" to fight "a gala game."
"Fierty" also to see - as "neighbourly" - that France has become "a very high-level team" a little over a year after Knysna's trauma.
"Laurent Blanc did a tonner work," he was excited.
While Belgium will miss the next Euro, the technician would be able to share the plane with the Blue Directions... Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are getting big," he said.
"We're building something, players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You'll be aware of this in the next matches." The one against France included.
Portugal very confident
Paulo Bento's Portugal starts with a lot of optimism its dam back in front of Bosnia (22h00), this Tuesday in Lisbon.
On the way, the two teams lacked realism.
"At the end of those 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento already sees himself there, in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no shadow of a doubt, the Selecçao, which he has been holding since September 2010, will qualify for the Euro 2012.
Portugal is only 90 minutes away from happiness.
But there's a game to play, and an opponent, Bosnia, to start.
In view of the game go (0-0), Friday in Zenica's hell, it seemed obvious that the games are not made.
Portugal dominated the part for more than an hour, of course, but it was unable to mark this precious goal, which would have relieved it.
"It is a good result, however, that has a certain risk because we have not achieved a goal outside"
But at home, in their bright Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to pass, in front of an audience that should also be boiling there, even though the party obviously announces itself "very tight", said a bright but optimistic Bento.
"We expect a very tight game, but we are absolutely convinced that we can take it up," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We continue to have 50% chance to be at the Euro 2012", nevertheless relativized the successor of Carlos Queiroz.
The reported null Friday from Bosnia obliges the Portuguese to score and win.
No one can do enough for the Bosnians, who also need to score.
"It is a good result, however, that has a certain risk because we have not achieved a goal outside," regrets Bento.
"We're going to play against a team that has a lot of technical qualities and has many individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will intend to put in maximum pressure on the Bosnians so as not to "give them time to think."
A good idea, provided you prove realistic this time.
