Members of the Welsh Assembly are concerned about "making the figure of clowns"
Some members of the House are dismayed at the proposal to amend their title in MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Wales Parliament).
This proposal comes as a consequence of the programmes to amend the name of the assembly in the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly of the entire political arena are concerned that this may sound ridiculous.
A member of the Labour Party Assembly said that his party is concerned that "it may resonate with Twp and Pwp."
For readers who don't live in Wales: In Welsh, twp means asshole and pwp means cock.
One member of the Plaid Assembly said that the group as a whole "was not happy" and suggested alternatives.
One member of the Welsh Conservative Party claimed to be "open" towards the change of name, but stressed that only a small verbal step separates MWP from Muppet (sunny).
In this context, the letter W in Welsh is pronounced in a similar manner to the English pronunciation of Yorkshire of the letter U.
The Committee of the Assembly, which is currently preparing for the introduction of the amendments to the names, said: "The final decision on any descriptors of what members of the House will be called will of course be a subject of debate for the members themselves."
The Law of the Government of Wales of 2017 granted the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which provided extensive support for the possibility of calling the House of Wales.
With regard to the title of members of the House, the Commission expressed its preference for Welsh Parliament Members or WMP (Members of the Welsh Parliament), but the MWP option received greater agreement in a public consultation.
The AMs are apparently proposing alternative options, but the difficulties in reaching consensus could prove to be a grubbing-up for President Elin Jones, who should submit a legislative proposal on the amendments within a few weeks.
The Reforms Act will include further changes to the functioning of the Assembly, including regulations on the exclusion of AM and the design of the committee system.
The AMs will get the final vote on their name during the discussion of the legislation.
Macedonians go to the referendum polls on the change of the country name
On Sunday the voters will decide whether to change their country's name to "Northern Republic of Macedonia."
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to end a dispute in progress for decades with bordering Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim on its territories and has repeatedly opposed its applications for membership of the EU and NATO.
The President of Macedonia Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite for the change of the name, said he would not take into account the result of the vote.
However, the referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that the change of name is simply the price to be paid in order to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's shut up while the churches of Harlem are in trouble
"The elders I spoke to say that in the past there was a bar and a church at every corner," Adams said.
"There's neither of us today."
He explained that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"People socialize differently today," he explained.
"Bars are no longer the neighborhood halls that people regularly attend."
As far as churches are concerned, it is concerned that the money derived from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders expect, "and sooner or later they will return where they started."
The churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings filled with condos filled with the type of people who will not help the remaining sanctuaries of the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings are white," he says, "and for this reason they will hasten the time when these churches will completely close because it is unlikely that most people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by fraternity before Harlem became a black neighborhood - Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St Martin's a decade later.
The initial white Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
A black congregation that prayed in a nearby church took possession of the building.
St. Martin's was acquired by a black congregation with the head Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott against the sellers of 125th Street, one of the main shopping streets in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote people of colour.
A fire in 1939 seriously damaged the building, but while Father Johnson's parishioners planned his reconstruction, they also ordered the carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor to St. Martin's, proudly called the "poor bells."
The expert who played the cartoon in July called it differently: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also stressed that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a color musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who passed to a larger carillon at the church of Riverside 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What has been staged at St. Martin's in recent months has been a complicated plot of architects and entrepreneurs, some presented by lay officials of the church, others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The parish assembly, the governing body of the parish, composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July concerning its concerns that the diocese "try to discharge costs" on the parish assembly although the parish assembly had not been involved in the recruitment of architects and entrepreneurs sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about a lack of transparency by the diocese.
Shark wounds a thirteen year in lobster fishing in California
Official sources state that on Saturday a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while he was diving in search of lobsters in California during the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that for half an hour he was immersing himself with friends on Saturday morning when he heard a boy scream and swam up to him together with a group of people to get him out of the water.
Hammel thought at first that it was only enthusiasm due to the capture of an lobster but then "he realized that the boy was shouting ‘I was bitten!
I was bitten!'
His entire clavicle was lacerated," he said that he noticed Hammel once he reached the boy.
"I cried out to everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" Hammel added.
The boy was transported with a helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted to critical conditions.
The species of the shark responsible for the attack is not known.
The beachguard Captain Larry Giles stated during a communication to the media that a shark had been sighted in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it had been declared not belonging to any dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered trauma in the upper chest area.
The authorities have prohibited access to the beach from Ponto Beach to Casablad until Swami's to Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigative and security purposes.
Giles reported that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's program a push towards beauty products sector in the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's is challenging Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with racing dedicated to the beauty products of the large warehouse assigned to specialized assistants
As part of the major push towards the UK $2.8 billion beauty products market, which continues to grow while sales in the fashion and household goods sectors decrease, the largest races dedicated to beauty products will be tested in 11 shops in the country and adopted in several shops next year in case of success.
The investment in beauty takes place at a time when supermarkets are hunting new ways to use space on shelves once dedicated to televisions, microwave ovens and household items.
Sainsbury's stated that it would double the size of its offer of beauty items up to 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will occupy a larger space with branded areas similar to those present in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its range of Boutique tricks so that most products are vegan - a quality increasingly demanded by younger buyers.
In addition, the perfumer The Fragrance Shop will experience authorisations in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, South London while a second will open in Sell Oak, Birmingham, later in the year.
Online shopping and a move towards the purchase of small quantities of food daily at small neighborhood stores have forced supermarkets to commit themselves more to convincing people to buy from them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said that the points will increasingly resemble large stores while the chain of supermarkets tries to resist discounts such as Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has introduced Argos sales points in hundreds of stores and has also introduced several Habitats since it purchased the two chains about two years ago, and this strategy has boosted food sales and made the acquisitions more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to return enamel to its beauty and pharmaceutical product departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s but synergy ended in a dispute over the distribution of revenues from pharmaceutical outlets in supermarkets.
The new strategy was adopted after Sainsbury's sold three years ago its pharmaceutical activity of 281 points sold to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds.
Lloyds was expected to play a role in the program, with the addition in four shops of an extensive range of luxury leather care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the appearance of our beauty product departments to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in particularly trained colleagues who will be available to provide advice.
Our range of brands has been developed to respond to every need and the inviting environment and comfortable positions make us an interesting destination for beauty products, in contrast to the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones "angry" after Holly Willoughby parades on an 11 million-pound deal
The star of Dragons Den, Peter Jones is furious after TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdrew from an 11 million-pound contract with her trend mark to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby no longer has time for his brand of housekeepers and Truly accessories.
The couple's activity had been compared to Gwyneth Paltew's Goop brand.
This Morning's 37-year-old presenter used Instagram to announce her abandonment.
Holly Willoughby left the star of Dragons Den, Peter Jones, furious after withdrawing from their profitable trendy activity at the last minute to focus on his exceptional new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Some sources claim that Jones was " furious" when the TV gold girl admitted during a meeting held at the headquarters of his commercial empire in Marlow, in Buckinghamshire, that his new contracts - worth £1.5 million - did not leave them enough time to dedicate themselves to their brand of real housekeepers and accessories.
The activity was compared to Gwyneth Paltew's Goop brand and it had been calculated that it would double Willoughby's assets, estimated around £11 million.
As soon as Willoughby, 37 years old, chose Instagram to announce his Truly abandonment, Jones left Britain to head for one of his holiday homes.
According to one source: "Truly was undoubtedly Holly's top priority.
It had to be his long-term future that would have engaged him for the next twenty years.
His decision to abandon has left all the people involved absolutely speechless.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, they were so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of products at Marlow headquarters, ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the abandonment of the presenter of This Morning, one of the most profitable stars in the United Kingdom, could cost the company millions due to the strong investments in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear and due to possible delays in the launch of the brand.
And it could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin were friends of Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined the company as president in March.
The couples spent together their holidays and Jones had a 40% share of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the ambassador of the M&S brand and will replace Ant McPartlin as a guest of the ITV program "I'm A Celebrity".
A source near Jones said last night that "he doesn't want to comment on his business."
Hard words and "then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he would have received from the media to comment that some would have judged "non-presidential" and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his voice in imitation of the "telelegor conductor".
"I have not given up anything."
He stressed that Kim was interested in a second meeting after the first event in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump as a huge step forward towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But the negotiations for denuclearisation are at a dead end.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho addressed world leaders during the UN General Assembly held on Saturday, which North Korea did not observe an "equivalent response" from the USA to the first disarmament operations in North Korea.
Instead, he stressed, the USA is continuing to impose sanctions to maintain high pressure.
Trump gave a much more optimistic view of this speech.
"With North Korea we are achieving excellent results," he said.
"We were about to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results: the end of the missile tests, the contribution to the release of hostages and the return of the last American military.
And he defended his unusual strategy by describing his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 outside people trying to get into this crowded field, we'd have about 200 people right here," Trump said, pointing out the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroy an island, causing hundreds of victims
Following the Lombok earthquake, for example, non-governmental organizations had been informed that they were not necessary.
Although more than 10% of the Lombok population had been displaced, the national emergency had not been declared an essential requirement to activate international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear about not wanting international assistance, so it's a bit complicated," Subong said.
While Save the Children is organizing a team that will visit Palu, it is not yet certain that the foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
Soup, spokesperson for the National Disaster Agency, said that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to decide whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid.
Considering the earthquakes to which Indonesia is constantly subjected, the country continues to be terribly unprepared in the face of the fury of nature.
Although shelters have been built in Aceh, this is not a common structure on other coasts.
The obvious lack of an alarm siren for the tsunamis in Palu, although the alarm had been given, probably contributed to the loss of human lives.
Under the best conditions, moving between the many islands of Indonesia is complicated.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship anchored in Lombok to assist the earthquake victims is heading towards Palu but it will take at least three days to reach the place of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has placed at the centre of his electoral campaign the improvement of Indonesia's branded infrastructure and poured money on roads and railways.
But the lack of funds hit Joko's administration while preparing for re-election next year.
Joko must also face pressures from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted the most conservative branch of religion.
Over 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands taken away from their homes because of clashes on the streets between Christian and Muslim gangs, who are fighting using machetes, arches and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
Look: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool stands against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat in the Premier League against Chelsea with a stop at the 89th minute of Saturday, at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while located about 25 meters from the Chelsea door, with his team below for 1-0.
He touched the left ball before shooting on the second pole.
The attempt passed high above the door frame as it turned towards the top right corner of the network.
Finally, the ball fell behind Kepa Arrizabalaga and was sucked into the net.
"It was enough to try to get in position, get to the ball and players like Shaq always play forward as much as possible, so I tried to create myself as long as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come in and I touched and I didn't think about it too much and I pulled it."
Chelsea won 1-0 in the first time after the 25th minute goal marked by Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The centerpiece of the Blue went by heel to Mateo Kovacic before skimming away near the middle of the field and taking off in the middle of Liverpool.
Kovacic made a quick transition to midfield.
So he performed a beautiful passage that brought Hazard to the area.
Hazard passed the defense and ended up on the second pole with a left-wing goal beyond Alisson Becker of Liverpool.
Liverpool will face Naples in the round-the-clock season of the Champions League at St. Paul's Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will have to face Videoton in UEFA Europe League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia rises to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia reached 832, declared on Sunday morning the agency responsible for managing the country's disasters.
Many people were reported trapped among the debris of the collapsed buildings following the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that struck the country on Friday and generated high waves up to 6 meters, reported the spokesman of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho during a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has over 380,000 inhabitants, has been swept away by debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman gets stabbed to death
A murder investigation was launched after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55 a.m. with cut-gun wounds at Grayson Mews in John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested for suspected murder.
The police invited people who might have seen or heard something in the area to contact.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is just at the beginning but I would like to appeal to anyone near John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard something suspicious and to invite them to contact us.
I would also like to appeal to anyone, in particular to taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on Dashcam, to contact us because they may have very important information for our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was resident in Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, some friends who claim to know the woman arrived on the scene of the crime to ask questions about the place of the rendezvous this morning.
The investigations are under way and the police have said that they are currently informing the relatives of the victim.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment but was informed by the police that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents have been informed that it will take hours before they are allowed to return.
A police officer told a man that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman appeared on the scene in tears.
He keeps saying "it's terrible."
At 1400 two police vans were inside the delimited area and another van was just outside.
Several agents were within the delimited area by checking the apartment building.
Anyone who has information on this subject is invited to contact @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111 indicating registration 247 of 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell of Parliament becomes the last monument struck by the wave of "rewriting of history"
His departure would be poetic justice for his Taliban destruction of so many religious and cultural objects of England carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society has defined Crick's proposal as a "follia" and an "intent to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the light of the current debate on the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside the Westminster Palace became an objective.
The iconoclasty during the British civil wars was neither ordered nor conducted by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft by Cromwell is proof of the opinion of the 19th century and part of the history of a figure that many believe should still be celebrated.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, a parliamentary defender of external pressures, in his case of monarchy.
This is an extremely accurate representation which is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the middle 17th century has defined the next development of our nation, and Cromwell is an identifiable figure that represents part of that fracture.
His results as Lord Protector must be celebrated and commemorated."
Pig killer blows up a Chinese farmer killing him
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in South-West China according to local media reports.
The man, identified only with the name "Yuan", was found dead with a narrow artery, covered in blood near a pig in the Liupanshui market in the province of Guizhou, reported on Sunday the South China Morning Post.
A pig breeder is preparing to inject vaccines to pigs in a farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining in Qinghai Province, China.
It is reported that he had traveled with the cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan Wednesday to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning, the cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a nearby pig was open.
He said there was a big male pig in the pigs with blood on the muzzle.
A forensic analysis confirmed that the 250 kg pig had broken the breeder, according to the statements.
"My cousin's legs were covered in blood and maculated," said the cousin identified with the surname "Wu", as reported in Guiyang Evening News.
The surveillance videos showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 p.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
Her body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or cousin.
A market leader told Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent other people from attacking while the police collect evidence on the crime scene.
The Yuan family and market authorities are negotiating a refund for the death of the farmer.
Although rare, cases of attacks on humans by pigs have already been reported in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a pig of 300 kg nailed a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife managed to get rid of the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon was devoured by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as "catalizer."
"They just want to play.
They're playful, very curious... they don't want to hurt.
Just show them the right dose of respect," he explained.
Rascals of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy rains in the southwest of the USA
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is losing strength as it moves on the coldest waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains on northern Mexico and on the south-western coast of the USA in the coming days.
Rosa recorded twenty up to 138 km/h, a category 1 hurricane at 5 ET Sunday hours and was 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a sack is being formed on the Pacific Ocean and is moving eastward towards the western coast of the USA. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm, she will start pushing a strong tropical humidity north, in the southwestern part of the USA.
Rosa will bring up to 25 cm of rain in some areas of Mexico during Monday.
Therefore, tropical humidity in contact with the surrounding sac will create heavy and vast rainfall in the south-west area in the coming days.
At local level, from 2 to 10 cm of rain can cause dangerous floods, debris flows and possible landslides in the desert.
Tropical humidity will cause precipitation rates that will reach 2.5 to 7.5 cm per hour at some points, particularly in the areas of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Precipitation of 2.5-10 cm of rain is expected in some areas of the south-west, particularly on most of Arizona.
Sudden flooding may occur with rapidly worsening conditions due to the widespread nature of tropical rains.
It is strongly advised to venture in the desert on foot in the presence of the threat of tropical rain.
The heavy rains could make the canyons of rivers full and the storms will bring wind to blows and lift dust.
The incoming bag will cause heavy local rains on the southern coast of California.
Precipitation of more than 1 cm will be possible, which could cause limited streams of slippery debris and carriages.
This would be the first precipitation of the region in the wet season.
Some scattered tropical rains will start approaching Arizona towards the end of Sunday and early Monday, before the rains become wider at the end of Monday and early Tuesday.
Heavy rains will fall on the Four Corners Tuesday to last until Wednesday.
In October there will be strong fluctuations in the US as the Arctic cools, but the tropics will remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to important temperature variations over short distances.
An outstanding example of sensitive temperature differences in the central USA will be recorded on Sunday.
There will be a difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, the remaining heat of the summer will try to increase and expand again.
It is expected a warm beginning of October for much of the central and eastern USA, with 26 oC from Southern Plains to the north-east areas.
In New York you can reach 26 degrees Tuesday, a temperature of about 12 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecasts indicate high temperatures above average for the Eastern US until the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's audience
Over 20 million people followed on Thursday six television networks the successful filing by the candidate of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual violence that would take place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continues, with broadcasters interrupting regular programming for a last minute on Friday: an agreement designed by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to conduct a one-week investigation of charges.
Ford informed the Senate Justice Commission that it is 100% certain that Kavanaugh slapped her in a state of drunkenness and tried to strip her during a superior party.
Kavanaugh, during an infamous deposition, claimed to be 100% certain that this did not happen.
More than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday are likely to have followed the deposition.
The company was calculating the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for the other networks that transmitted it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually finds it difficult to count the viewers who follow the programs in the offices.
To put it all in perspective, it is a similar audience to that for a football playoff game or for Oscar prizes.
Fox News Channel, whose opinionists strongly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, led all networks, with an average of 5.69 million spectators during the hearing throughout the day, reported Nielsen.
ABC was the second network with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS recorded 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure of Friday's drama.
After the moderate republican's office issued a statement stating that it would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, Flake was resumed by CNN and CBS operators on Friday morning while being insulted by demonstrators while trying to take an elevator to a hearing of the Justice Commission.
He remained with low eyes for several minutes while being reproached and broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm right here in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told "He has power while many women are powerless."
Flake stated that his office had issued the statement and stated, before the elevator closed, that he would have other things to say during the committee hearing.
All cable networks and broadcasters broadcast live a few hours later, when the Justice Commission voted to present Kavanaugh's appointment to the entire Senate for one vote.
But Flake said that he would only do so with the certainty that the FBI would analyze the charges against the candidate during the following week, as requested by minority democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Following a discussion with Coons and other senators later, Flake made his decision.
The choice of Flake was important, because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump initiated an FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "making politics" on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of letting the European Union "politically face" the future of Britain and jeopardise national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, September 29, 2018.
In another interview with the Prime Minister on the front page of the newspaper, his former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson launched his attack on his so-called Chequers agreement for Brexit, stating that a proposal that Britain and the EU must collect their duties is "absolutely ridiculous"
Murder of Wayde Sims: Police Arrests Suspected Killer of LSU Dyteon Simpson Player
Police arrested a suspected death by gun by Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, was arrested and taken to prison on a second-degree murder charge, declared Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities released a video of the clash between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the crime scene and claimed to have detected Simpson's DNA on them, reports the WAFB television station affiliated with CBS.
After questioning Simpson, the police said the suspect admitted to accidentally shooting Wayde.
The bail was set at $350,000, the defense lawyer reported.
The East Baton Rouge forensics office issued a preliminary report on Friday, in which it states that the cause of death is a gunshot wound to the neck.
The department recognized the merit of the task force for the fugitives of the State of Louisiana police, the police science laboratory, the Southern University police and the citizens of the area who assisted in the investigation that led to the arrest.
The athletic director of the LSU thanked the forces of the order of the area for their commitment and the search for justice."
Sims was 20.
The 198 cm attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where even the father, Wayne, played basketball for the LSU.
Last season the player had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 2.6 roundbacks.
Friday morning, LSU coach Will Wade stated that the team is "shuffled" and "under shock" for Wayde's death.
"This is what you're worried about all the time," Wade said.
Vulcan ash cosparge Mexico City
The ashes coming out of the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern districts of the capital of Mexico.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention advised Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano, after the activity had increased in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions had been recorded within 24 hours.
The center was checking the different waves and shocks.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash covering the windshield of cars in Mexico City as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have found an increase in the activity corresponding to the volcano located 45 miles (72 kilometers) south-east of the capital since an magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck the central area of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clashes with Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the Independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with police anti-sommous teams and thousands of people joined in demonstrations of opponents to recall the first anniversary of the controversial Catalan vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists obstructed by the anti-sommous police targeted the police with eggs and threw powder paint, creating dark dust clouds on the streets that usually cross tourists.
Further clashes occurred during the day with police officers who used manganese to contain the fight.
For several hours the groups of independentists who sang "We will not forget, we will not forgive" were confronted with demonstrators who shouted "Long life in Spain."
The local press reported that fourteen people had to receive treatment for minor injuries received during the demonstrations.
Tension remains high in the independent region one year after the referendum of 1 October considered illegal by the Government of Madrid but recognised by Catalan separatists.
The voters had voted with a overwhelming majority for independence, although the influx had been low, and the Catalans opposed the secession had largely boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people reported injuries last year after the police had tried to stop the referendum that was taking place at headquarters throughout the region with violent clashes.
The independent groups had gathered on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place but had to follow an alternative path.
Narcis Termes, 68, is an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife and claimed that he no longer had hope for Catalonia to become independent.
"Last year we lived one of our best moments.
I've seen my parents cry for joy for the chance to vote, but now everything is blocked," he explained.
Despite having won a fundamental victory despite measuring the regional elections last December, independent Catalan parties have made it difficult to maintain momentum this year, with many of the most well-known leaders of the movement who find themselves in voluntary exile or in prison awaiting trial for their role in the organization of the referendum and in the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded with his phone the protest in support of the police, said that the conflict was fuelled by politicians from both factions.
"The situation is increasingly tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in prison awaiting trial since the end of last year, announced that he will be running for elections to the European Parliament next year.
"Presenting me as a candidate for European elections is the best way to denounce the evolution of democratic values and repression by the Spanish government," he explained.
Londonderry: men arrested after spooking a house with a car
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years old, were arrested after they repeatedly hit a Londonderry house with a car.
The accident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at about 19:30 BST.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said the damage was caused to the gates and the building itself.
It is also possible that the car was hit with a ballast at some point.
Menga's attack marks the victory of Livingston at 1-0 against the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal with Livingston signed the victory
The already promoted Livingston has left the Rangers astonished by relegating Steven Gerrard to his second defeat in 18 matches as director of the club of Ibrax.
Dolly Menga's goal made a difference as Gary Holt's team moved into the second division with the Hibernian.
Gerrard's team therefore remains without an out-of-home victory in Premiership this season and will have to face the first ones in Hearts ranking next Sunday, from which they separate 8 points.
Thursday the Rangers hosted the Rapid Vienna in Europe League.
Meanwhile the Livingston continues his series of wins in the division being beaten for six matches, with Coach Holt who has yet to see a defeat since he replaced Kenny Mile last month.
Livingston wastes opportunities against unincisive guests
Holt's team should have been in advantage long before the goal, with their immediateity that caused the Rangers many problems.
Scott Robinson crashed but dragged his action in front of the door mirror and Alan Lithgow could only kick out the door after he entered to meet Craig Halkett's head shot from the other side of the door.
The guests were content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could have put the visitors in trouble with footballs placed.
And that is how the crucial goal has been achieved.
The Rangers gave a kick of punishment and the Livingston found an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson managed to move to Menga, which could mark from the center of the area.
Until then, the Rangers had dominated in possession of a ball but the defense of the host team had proved impenetrable and the doorman Liam Kelly had not had to worry too much,
This scheme was maintained during the second time, although Alfredo Morelos engaged Kelly in a parade.
Scott Pittman saw his goal attempt stopped by the Rangers' Allan McGregor goalkeeper and Lithgow shot out of another Livingston game scheme.
Crosses happened in the Livingston area and were continuously neutralized, while two strict demands, after Halkett's contrast with the replacement Glenn Middleton and one by hand failure, were refused.
A "phenomenal" performance from Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland to Tony Macaroni Arena
A performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
Until the last player, they were exceptional, continuing to overcome expectations along this exceptional trajectory.
Their style of play and the collaborators have changed very little since their return to the maximum series, but you have to give a lot of credit to Holt for the way he knew how to spray the team since his arrival.
He's had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was immense, led by a masterly organized defense, while Menga put Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall into difficulty throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, were uninspired.
Despite the excellent performance in some moments with Gerard, in this case they have fallen well below those standards.
It was missing the last step - only once they managed to penetrate the opposing area - and you can consider an alarm bell for the Rangers, which are in half-class.
Erdogan received with conflicting reactions in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies on Saturday (September 29th) during the breakfast meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
This was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, aimed at distancing relations between NATO allies.
Issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's access to the EU have been discussed.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne for the inauguration of a huge new mosque.
The city hosts the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police have certainly motivated the intervention to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from meeting in front of the mosque, but many supporters have appeared nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, including numerous Kurds, have made their voices heard, condemning Erdogan's policies and the decision of the German government to welcome him into the country.
The protests reflect the dissent caused by a visitor considered a hero by some German Turks and called a despot by others.
Road accidents in Deptford: cyclist dies in conflict with a car
A cyclist died in the fight with a car in London.
The incident occurred near the intersection between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a trafficked road in Deptford, in the south-eastern area of the city, at about 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and an ambulance arrived on the spot, but the man died on the blow.
The accident occurred months after another cyclist died, invested by a road pirate in Childers Street, about a mile from where the Saturday accident occurred.
The metropolitan police said the authorities are working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Roads and buses have been blocked and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six wounded guards during a riot
Six prison guards were injured during a riot at the maximum-security male prison, reported the prison office.
The tumult exploded at Long Lartin's maximum-security male prison in Worcestershire at about 09:30 BST on Sunday and is still underway.
The specialized agents "Tornado" were used to manage the tumult, involving eight prisoners and confined to an wing of the prison.
Agents were treated on the spot for slight facial injuries.
A prison spokesperson said: "Personal prison specifically trained has been deployed to contain an accident currently taking place at Long Lartin Prison.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate the presence of violence in our prisons and all those responsible will be reported to the police and could be sentenced to a longer term in prison."
Long Lartin prison houses over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison director had to receive hospital care following the attack of a prisoner.
And in October last year, anti-sommous agents were called to intervene in the prison to heal a violent riot during which the staff was attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (which could benefit drought-affected areas)
It is rare that a tropical depression strikes Arizona, but it is exactly what will probably happen at the beginning of next week when the last energies of Hurricane Rosa will cross the southwest of the desert, creating risks of sudden flooding.
The national weather service has already issued sudden flooding alerts for Monday and Tuesday in Western Arizona up to southern and eastern Nevada, South-West California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will head directly to Phoenix Tuesday, approaching Monday evening with rain.
Phoenix's national weather service reported in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclists have maintained the state of tropical storm or tropical depression within 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Center for Hurricanes predict precipitation between 5 and 10 cm, with isolated peaks up to 15 cm in the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas of the south-west area, including the central rocky mountains and the Great Basin will receive from 2.5 to 5 cm of precipitation, with isolated peaks up to 10 cm.
For areas outside the risk of sudden flooding, the rain brought by Rosa could be a blessing as the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some of these rainfalls will probably be positive because the South-West area is currently going through a period of drought.
According to the Drought Monitoring Centre, just over 40% of Arizona is going through a period of extreme drought, the second highest category," saidweather.com.
Initially the path of Hurricane Rosa will be able to land through the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still holding the hurricane force on Sunday morning with winds at a maximum speed of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, in Mexico and is moving north to 12 miles per hour.
The storm will emerge with the coldest waters in the Pacific, thus losing power.
So it is expected that it will arrive in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or in the evening of Monday.
Precipitation on parts of Mexico may be intense, creating a high risk of flooding.
"Precipitation is expected between 7.5 cm and 15 cm from Baja California to the north-western part of Sonora, with a maximum of 25 cm," saidweather.com.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours of Tuesday with a state of tropical depression, to then head across Arizona and towards South Utah in late Tuesday evening.
"The main risk that could be caused by Rosa or her strascics are intense rainfall in Baja California, in the north-western part of Sonora and in the south-western desert area of the USA," said the National Center for Hurricanes.
These rains are expected to generate potentially lethal sudden flooding and debris flows in the deserts, as well as landslides on the mountains.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys to a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a sixteen-year-old was found with gunshot wounds in Somerset.
The boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at approximately 4:00 BST on Saturday.
He was transferred to the hospital, where he remains in "steady" conditions.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, reported Avon and Somerset police.
The authorities appealed to anyone who could have taken what happened with the phone.
Trump claims that Kavanaugh "has suffered for the evil and anger" of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said during a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump stated that Kavanaugh has "suffered for the evil and anger" of the democratic party during the entire appointment process.
Kavanaugh filed before Congress on Thursday, denying passionately and decisively Christine Blasey Ford's accusations of sexual violence against her decades ago when they were still teenagers.
Ford also filed the hearing defending himself from the prosecution.
The President stated on Saturday that "the American people could observe the extraordinary quality and courage" of Kavanaugh on that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most experienced legal minds of our time, a lawyer with unprecedented record in public service," he said in front of the crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the appointment of Kavanaugh by referring to the importance of republican influence to midterm elections.
"Five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but I really have to do it," he said.
"That's why I struggle for exceptional candidates."
Trump said the Democrats are committing themselves to "resisting and hindering."
The first basic procedural vote in the Senate for the appointment of Kavanaugh will take place no later than Friday, as stated to CNN a senior assistant to the GOP management.
Hundreds of people killed by the earthquake in Indonesia and the tsunami, and the numbers of victims continue to rise
At least 384 people were killed, many being swept away by giant waves that fell on the beaches, when an earthquake of great magnitude and a tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, said the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach of the city of Palu Friday, when waves up to 6 meters (18 feet) fell on the beach at dusk, sweeping away many people killing them and destroying anything on their way.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
"When the tsunami threat came out yesterday, people were still busy with their activities on the beach and they didn't run away immediately, turning into victims," said Jakarta Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian Agency for Disaster Control BNPB.
"The tsunami did not come alone, dragged with itself cars, logs, houses, struck anything on the mainland," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami moved into the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 miles/hour) before hitting the coast.
Some people have jumped on trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he explained.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Air photographs published by the Agency for Disasters have shown numerous destroyed buildings and shops, rounded and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Asses continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was perceived in an area with 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) stated in a statement that the energy released by the strong earthquake on Friday was nearly 200 times the power of the atomic bomb launched on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which is at the end of a long and narrow bay, could have enhanced the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extended" and claimed that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the debris of collapsed buildings and added that 540 people were injured and 29 were dispersed.
Nugroho said that the victims and damage could be greater along the coast of 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications "are totally paralyzed, with no information" by Donggala said Nugroho.
There are over 300,000 people living in the area," said the Red Cross, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading towards the areas involved.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could become even more serious," he said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not informing that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the authorities said the waves arrived at the time the alarm was launched.
In an amateur video shared on social media, you hear a man on a top floor of a building who shouts agitatedly to warn of the incoming tsunami people on the road below.
A few minutes after a water wall fell on the beach, sweeping away buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to authenticate the video immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a huge blackout that interrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate relief interventions.
According to the authorities, the army began sending cargo aircraft with aid from Jakarta and other cities, but displaced persons still need food and other necessities.
The airport of the city was reopened only for relief and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo scheduled a visit to the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The tsunami victims' budget in Indonesia rises to more than 800.
It's terrible.
Although the World Vision staff of Donggala managed to reach the city of Palu, where the employees took refuge under canvas shelters in the courtyard of their office, during the journey they encountered scenes of devastation, Dosebah said.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
It's terrible.
Even while relief groups began the difficult start-up operations of relief gears, there were some complaints about the fact that foreign rescue operators with extensive knowledge were prevented from travelling to Palu.
The Indonesian regulations stipulate that funding, supplies and staff from abroad may begin to arrive only if the site of a disaster has been declared an area of national catastrophe.
And this has not yet happened.
"It's still a provincial disaster," said Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says, "O.K., it's a national disaster," we may accept international assistance, but the status has not yet been defined."
The second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday, friends and family members of the disperse still maintained the hope that their loved ones would be part of the miracles that alleviate the sad stories of natural disasters.
Saturday a child was extracted from a discharge.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been stuck under the rubble for two days with her mother's body next door.
Gendon Subandono, the preparation of the Indonesian National Paragliding Team, had trained for the Asian Games that ended this month in Indonesia two of the lost paragliding drivers.
Other people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi, were his students.
"As a veteran in the paragliding sector, I am carrying my emotional burden," he said.
Gendon told how, in the hours following the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel within the paragliding community, he desperately sent messages via WhatsApp to Palu's competitors, who were participating in the festival on the beach.
His messages, however, stopped at a single sign of gray hint instead of two blue marks.
"I think it means that the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Stealing thieves $26,750 during an ATM supply in Newport on the Levee
Friday morning the thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink operator who was supplying an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the vehicle was emptying an ATM in the entertainment center and preparing to deliver another money, said researcher Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
While he was busy, another man "got behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag with the money intended for delivery.
Some witnesses identified several suspects fleeing the crime scene, according to the statement, but the police did not specify the number of people involved.
Anyone who has information about the identity of offenders is invited to contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper Changes His Name in Ye · Global Voices
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
To announce on Saturday the change of name on Twitter, he wrote: "The person formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41 years old, has been nicknamed Ye for a long time and has used the nickname as the title of his eighth album, which came out in June.
The change took place before his participation in Saturday Night Live, where he will present his new album, Yandhi.
Replaces in the program the singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled his participation for "emotional ratios", declared the creator of the show.
In addition to being an abbreviation for his current professional name, West previously stated that the word contains a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and it means 'you'" said West at the beginning of the year, talking about the title of his album with the radio host Big Boy.
"So it's you, it's us, it's us.
We have passed from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye - the reflection of our goodness, our wickedness, our confusion, everything.
The album is more than a reflection of who we are."
It's just one of several famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former collaborator from West, JAY-Z, also changed the name with or without a dash and capital letters.
Mexico's elected president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador swore not to use the army against the civilian population
Mexican elected president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised never to use military force against the civilian population, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday in Tlatelolco Square "never use the army to suppress the Mexican people."
The soldiers had shot at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were taking their toll throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by increasing monthly student subsidies and opening more public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of training opportunities lead young people to criminal gangs.
The USA should double funding for the IA
As China becomes increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the USA should double its research funds in this field, says the investor and operator of AI Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments follow the announcements of different US government groups on AI, although in general a formal AI strategy is lacking in the USA.
Meanwhile, China presented its programme last year: it looks forward to being the country 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
"To double the budget in the search for the AI would be a good start considering that all other countries are far behind the USA and we need a new revolution in the AI," Lee said.
Double funding could double the chances that the next great success in the AI sector will be achieved in the USA, Lee told CNBC during an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by the publishing house Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Innovation Ventures, who invested in one of the leading AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Mellon University worked on an AI system that beat the U.S. player with the highest score and later was head of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese section of Google.
Lee recalled the previous US government technological competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when you'll be holding the next one, to be able to identify new visionaries.
Researchers in the USA often have to work hard to get funds from the government, Lee said.
"It's not China that's taking academic leaders away, it's multinationals," said Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have taken luminaires from universities to work on AI projects.
Lee said that changes to immigration policy could help the US to boost its efforts under AI.
"I think the green cards should be offered automatically to the PhDs in AI," he explained.
The Chinese Council of State published its programme for the development of the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China provides funding to those working in academic institutions, similar to how the National Foundation for Science and Other Government Organizations distribute funds to US researchers, poor quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee explained.
At the beginning of this year, the US Department of Defence set up a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence to involve industrial partners and universities and the White House announced the formation of a Special Commission for Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as NSF is concerned, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
In the meantime, the US order to create a National Commission for Security on Artificial Intelligence has not registered activities for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum for the change of the country name
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on the possible change of the country's name to the "Northern Republic of Macedonia", a move that would resolve the dispute for decades with Greece which blocked its requests for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which owns a province called Macedonia, argues that the name of its neighbours constitutes a pretense on its territory and has put the ban on Macedonia's entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but the nationalist opponents believe that change would damage the ethnic identity of the people of Macedonia by a slave majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote for the referendum and the boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether the influx would reach the minimum of 50% necessary for the referendum's validity.
The request on the referendum card is as follows: "It agrees with accession to NATO and the EU and with acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that it is the price to be paid so that Macedonia can be admitted to institutions such as the EU and NATO, one of the countries emerging from the collapse of former Yugoslavia.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the aegis of the European Union because this means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79 years old, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members of Parliament have stated that it will respect the outcome of the vote to make it final.
The change in the name would require a two-thirds majority.
The State Electoral Commission has stated that there have been no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, the flu was only 16% compared to 34% of the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62 years old, an elector of the capital, Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko voted for the referendum in Macedonia for the change of the name of the country that would open the door to accession to NATO and to the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Parament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavarkov, 54 years old, was preparing a small stage and setting up the chairs in front of the tents mounted by those who want to boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to head up, not for the service door," said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have a dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China or Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev states that accession to NATO will bring much-needed investment in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20%.
"I believe that the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He said a "yes" would be the "confirmation of our future."
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Analysis reported that between 30 and 43% of the voters would have participated in the referendum - a percentage below the required influx.
Another survey conducted by Telma TV from Macedonia indicated that 57% of the interviewees planned to vote on Sunday.
Of this 57%, 70% said it would vote for yes.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the influx must be 50% plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the policy of the philo-Western government since it settled in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero del Manchester City marks a goal avoiding the entire defense of Brighton
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took care of the Brighton defense during the 2-0 match won by Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguaro made it seem extremely easy to score at the 65th minute.
The Argentine attacker received a midfield passage at the beginning of the action.
He moved between three Brighton defenders before catapulting on the free field.
Aguaro was then surrounded by four green meshes.
He humiliated a defender before overcoming several others to the limit of the Brighton area.
He then made a left passage, where he found Sterling.
The English attacker used the first touch in the area to return the ball to Aguero, which used the right foot to beat the doorkeeper of Brighton Mathew Ryan with a shot right on the net.
"Aguaro is having problems at his feet," Pep Guardiola told the journalists the coach of the City.
"We talked about making him play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he managed to score at the time."
But it was Sterling who initially brought the Sky Blues into the struggle for the Premier League.
The goal has reached the 29th minute.
Aguaro received the ball in depth on the Brighton field.
He sent a nice filter ball along the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few steps before driving Sterling to the second pole.
The Sky Blues attacker pulled the ball over the net shortly before leaving the camp.
The City will fight Hoffenheim around the Champions League at 12:55 p.m. at the stadium Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim in Germany.
Scarzer wants to play dirty against the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the playoffs, there was no reason to force another start.
But how ever competitive Scherzer hopes to be able to launch Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, which hold an advantage of a game on the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies won at least one catch with a win of 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday evening, but still hope to get their title in the first division.
"Even if we play aimlessly, at least we can be able to launch knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team that will play will probably be at the highest level this year.
And why shouldn't I ever want to compete?"
The Nationals still have to announce a first launcher for Sunday, but they are said to be inclined to let Scherzer launch in such situations.
Scherzer, who would be the first launcher for the 34th time, held a launch session on Thursday and would be the first launcher on his normal Sunday of rest.
The Washington launcher is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeout in 220 2/3 inning for this season.
Trump at a rally in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation surrounding his candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke of the importance of the influx of Republicans in midterm elections.
"All we've done is put into play in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is one of the great, great -- I'm not a candidate, but I'm really starting to do this because I fight for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump went on to say, "Let's see this horrible group of radical democrats, it's happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by any means necessary, it is possible to see evil, meschinity.
They don't care who they can hit, who have to overthrow in order to regain power and control, because that's what they want, power and control, and we won't give it to them."
The democrats, he said, have given themselves the mission of "resisting and hindering."
"And it has been possible to see him in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "angered, bad, mean and lying."
He referred to the Senate Justice Commission with Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein by name, triggering strong cracks between the public.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did you get the document?
Um, uh, what.
No, uh, no, wait one - that was a bad language of the body - the worst language of the body I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer very tolerant.
Don't tolerate people who say what they think
When the Momentum activists of my local party voted to censure me, it was not a great surprise.
After all, I am the last of a number of members of the Labour Parliament to whom it has been notified not to be welcomed, and all because they said what they thought.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, has received similar treatment because he has resolutely opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for expressing my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically all issues similar to those on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday states that "we wish the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as a member of the parliament of the local Labour Party, Friday evening meetings were exactly like this.
Today, however, this is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a "more kind and courteous" policy has long been forgotten, if ever remembered.
It has become increasingly obvious that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and any opinion is judged on the basis of whether or not it is acceptable for party leadership.
All this began shortly after Jeremy became the leader of the party, and colleagues with whom I previously thought to share a similar political vision began to expect a shift from me and to take positions that I would never have accepted, whether it was national security or the single European market.
When I speak in public - and it doesn't really matter what I say - they follow insults on social media that demand my withdrawal, denouncing the politics of the centre and telling me that I should not be part of the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I certainly know that I am more fortunate than my other colleagues because the comments to me tend to be of a political nature.
I am admired by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who have to face a stream of insults to a sexist or racist background every day but who do not allow themselves to be intimidated.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalization of levels of insults.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer in a tolerant environment and with every motion of distrust or modification of the selection rules, the party shrinks.
In the last two years I have been given a lot of advice, inviting me to lower the boss, not to express my opinions so openly and everything "would have been fine".
But it's not about doing this that I got into politics.
Since I entered the Labour Party 32 years ago, caused by the incuria of the Thatcher government that had left my secondary school class literally fall into pieces, I have tried to defend better public services for those who need it most, as local advisor or government minister.
I have never hidden my political views, not even in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could have been in any way puzzled by my political positions and the points of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who have promoted the motion on Friday, I would like to say that when the country is rushing towards a Brexit that will damage family nuclei, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy by talking about my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But in reality the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of exclusion or political opportunity will stop me from acting in defence of those I think are your best interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: An Unbeated Ayr Scaled the Classification
Two late attempts might have somehow unbalanced the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved the win in this exceptionally fun game of the Tennent championship day.
I'm at the top of the class now, the only team out of ten.
In the end it was their superior defense, as well as their daring, that pushed the home team and coach Peter Murchied had every reason to be satisfied.
"We have been tested in our games so far and we are still beaten, so I must be happy," said the coach.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said: "It is necessary to recognize the merit of Ayr, they have made better use of our opportunities."
The target of Grant Anderson at the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climate, but brought Ayr to the advantage, but a yellow card for Scottish player Rory Hughes, released by Warriors for the match, allowed Melrose to make the numbers speak and Jason Baggot caught an unconverted goal.
Climo increased the distance of the Ayr with a rigor before, right in half time, to score and then to convert a goal alone to bring the Ayr to 17-5 to the interval.
But the Melrose started well the second time and Patrick Anderson's goal, converted from Baggot, reduced the advantage to five points.
There was therefore a long interruption due to a serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, which was released, and upon reboot, the Ayr was rebounded in advantage thanks to a goal of Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
The replacement captain of the Ayr Blair Macpherson received a yellow sign and Melrose made the man pay in excess with an unconverted goal of Bruce Colvine, at the end of a moment of strong pressure.
But the home team came back and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow sign for a contrast with Climo without a ball, from the touch of rigor, MacPherson scored a touch down behind the Ayr's advance mix.
Climo converted, as he had already done almost since the reboot, after Rowe had collected football from David Armstrong's area and sent the flanker Gregor Henry to search for the fifth goal of the home team.
Still Game Star seeks a new career in catering
Ford Kieran, star of Still Game, decided to move to the hotel sector after discovering that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays the role of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, who writes and plays together with the long-standing partner Greg Hemphilll.
The couple announced that the next ninth series will also be the final one of the show and it seems Kiernan is thinking about a life after Craiglang.
According to official reports, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to issue statements, although a Scottish Sun source made it clear that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the "prosper food trade" of Glasgow.
'The sea is ours': Bolivia without outlet on the sea hopes that a court will reopen the path to the Pacific
The sailors patrol a naval headquarters covered in sartia in La Paz.
Public buildings display a blue ocean flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are decorated with the motto: "The sea is our right.
Recovering it is a duty."
In all of Bolivia without outlet on the sea, the memory of the lost coast and now in the hands of Chile after a bloody conflict over the resources of the 19th century is still alive, as is the desire to rock the Pacific Ocean once again.
These hopes have perhaps reached the highest level in decades, while Bolivia awaits the decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
" Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and of course is waiting for the result with a positive attitude," explained Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the International Court of Justice ruling on large screens throughout the country, in the hope that the Hague Court will welcome Bolivia's claim that, after decades of intermittent dialogue, Chile is obliged to negotiate, guaranteeing Bolivia an outlet on the sea of State competence.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia - who is facing a controversial battle for re-elections next year - has a lot in play with Monday's judgment.
"We are very close to our return to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will hardly decide in favour of Bolivia and that little would change if it did.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands has no power to assign Chilean territory and stated that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice arrives just six months after the final rounds indicates that the case ‘was not complicated’, said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from advancing the Bolivian cause, the past four years might have delayed it.
"The problem of access to the sea has been monopolized by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morale's belligerent rhetoric has forged any good intention remaining from Chile, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but it will be very difficult to maintain discussions as a result of what has happened.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative at the Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making process was particularly swift.
On Monday Bolivia will be able "to enjoy extraordinary opportunities in relations with Chile" and will have the opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreement with each other", he explained.
Calzadilla has also denied he Morales - one of the most popular presidents of Latin America - is using the maritime issue as political scheming.
" Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The sentence is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea claims that nuclear disarmament will not happen without confidence in the USA
The North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong I said that his nation will never disarm nuclear weapons unless he can trust Washington first.
He spoke to the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He appealed to the United States to be faithful to the promises made during the Singapore summit between the two rival leaders.
His comments come at a time when the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be planning to reopen diplomatic negotiations in a state of stagnation after the meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
It explains again that it is an "illusion" that the continuation of the sanctions and the opposition of the USA to a declaration of the end of the Korean War can never put North Korea on its knees.
Washington is calling for the declaration to be issued without the first Pyongyang performing important disarmament actions.
Both President Kim and President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism about Pyongyang intending to give up an arsenal that the country probably considers the only way to ensure its own safety.
Pompeii is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare the second summit between Kim and Trump.
Parisian fashion shows present the latest trend in huge covers that will soon be in a high fashion store near you
If you want to expand your collection of covers or completely block the sun's rays, do not look further.
Valentine's and Thom Browne designers have revealed on the walkers a series of crazy oversized covers for their spring-summer 2019 collection that impressed the fashion world at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats have raged on Instagram this summer and these designers have sent their exciting creations on the walkway.
Valentino's main piece was an exaggerated hat of beige color decorated with a broad edge similar to feathers that submerged the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included jewelry, a witch hat and even a pineapple - but they were not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of these colored masks have sewn lips and look more like a representation of Hannibal Lecter than a haute couture.
One creation looked like a complete dive with masks and glasses, while another looked like a melted ice-cream cone.
And if you continue with the huge statements of style, you're lucky.
Style observers predict that huge caps could reach you in the streets of high fashion.
The outsize hats arrive on the tail of "La Bomba", the straw hat with a span of more than one meter that has been seen on anyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the hat very little practical that invaded social media sent another huge creation in the walkway: a large beach bag in straw almost as the model in costume that carries it.
The burnt orange striped bag, finished with striped fringes and with a white leather handle was the strong piece of the spring-summer 2019 collection by Jacquemus' La Riviera at Paris Fashion Week.
The celebrity designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect these big beach hats and bags will arrive in luxury stores next summer, as the designer has got such a big impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversize accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scottish independent schools maintain a curriculum of academic excellence and this is continued in 2018 with another series of outstanding exam results, reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other collective efforts.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are looking forward to providing the best level of service to their students and parents.
Independent schools are eager to prepare pupils for further higher education, their chosen career and their place in the world as global citizens.
As a field of education able to develop and adopt a personalised school curriculum, we note that modern languages continue to be a popular and required subject within schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, the message will reach his brain.
If you speak to him in his mother tongue, the message will reach his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot trust only English if we want to create trust relationships with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's exams, we can observe that languages are at the top of the graduates, with the highest success rates within independent schools.
68% of pupils who studied foreign languages obtained the highest scores.
Data, collected from the 74 SCIS member schools, showed that 72% of students obtained the highest vote with praise in Chinese, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish obtained the highest vote.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are promoting foreign languages as fundamental skills for children and young people, which will undoubtedly need them in the future.
Currently, languages, such as choice of subject matter, are considered at the same level as STEM materials (science, technology, technology and mathematics) in the study plans of independent institutions and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the United Kingdom Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that the reasons why employees indicated for the difficulty in covering jobs are attributable in 17% of cases to a lack of language skills.
For this reason language skills are becoming increasingly indispensable in preparing young people for their future careers.
With increasing job opportunities requiring language knowledge, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the chosen career, if you have learned a second language, you will have an effective advantage in the future with a lifelong competence like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically lead a multilingual person to competition.
According to a survey of YouGov among over 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75% were unable to speak a foreign language at a sufficient level to be able to hold a conversation and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15%.
This is why investing in language teaching is so important to children today.
Knowledge of more languages, particularly those of developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding a valid job.
In Scotland, each school will differ in the languages taught.
Several schools will focus on the most classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important for the United Kingdom by looking at 2020, such as Mandarin Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of your child, there will always be different languages to choose from in independent schools, with the specialized teachers in this area.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills necessary for success, regardless of their future.
It is not possible to deny at this time, in a global trading system, that languages continue to be fundamental to the future of the country, and this must be reflected in teaching.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
We've got to do it right.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will debut with the Lakers Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans waiting for LeBron James to make his first entry with the Los Angeles Lakes.
The Lakers coach, Luke Walton, announced that James will play in the Sunday pre-champed opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it must still be established for how many minutes it will play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the official Lakers website.
Lakers' reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will probably play for a limited number of minutes.
After training at the beginning of the week, James was asked what his plans were for the six pre-seasoned Lakers matches program.
"At this point in my career I don't need friendly games to prepare me," he said.
The time of the Trump West Virginia gathering, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump from the beginning tonight at Wheeling, West Virginia at a gathering break.
This is the first meeting of the five planned for Trump next week, including stops in friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote suspended for his choice to cover the vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump will try to create support for the upcoming midterm elections as the Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress at the November elections.
At what time will Trump's commission be and how can you follow it online?
Trump's committee in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19:00 ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow Trump's West Virginia online commission through live broadcast on YouTube.
Trump will probably talk about this week's hearings of the candidate for Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, who became the subject of charges of sexual violence with an early confirmation vote of the Senate suspended for a week while the FBI conducts investigations.
But the main purpose of this series of committees is to help the Republicans who have to face the November elections to get some momentum.
So President Trump's campaign stated that these five meetings next week are aimed at "giving energy to volunteers and supporters while the Republicans seek to protect and expand the majority they hold in the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies," according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so crucial for its programme that the president will travel in as many states as possible while we are joining the most committed season of the campaign," said a spokesperson for Trump's campaign in Reuters, asking to remain anonymous.
Programmed for Wheeling's Wesbank Arena, tonight's committee could call back supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract Pittsburgh's media coverage," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump will visit West Virginia, the state where he won over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate candidate in West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is in line in the polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come and try to give him a boost in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a West Virginia University politician, based in Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: the US team shows the courage to fight to keep hopes alive until Sunday individuals
After three unique sessions, Saturday afternoon quartets could have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The motion of the swinging pendulum is a completely invented sports concept in which players firmly believe and never as in races like these.
So where would the bike be now?
"They had a six-point advantage and now there are four, so I'd say we're keeping a little bike," said Jordan Spieth as he walked away at the end of the day.
Europe is, of course, in favour of four points ahead with another twelve at stake.
Americans feel they have a bit of wind in favor, as Spieth said, and they have a lot to be hopeful about, not since last the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each has three out of four points.
Spieth was ruthless from tee to green and he's setting the example.
The guttural shouts of celebration became stronger as the game continued, sinking a crucial putt to match the accounts at match four, when he and Thomas were under two points after two.
His putt who made them win the 15-hole match was greeted with a similar scream, which tells you that he thinks the American team is not out of the race yet.
"You really have to put her all to worry about your game," Spieth said.
That's all each of these players can do now.
18 holes to make a point.
The only players with several points by Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the untrustworthy version of Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable couple of Europe is four by four and can't do anything wrong.
"Moliwood" were the only couple not to shoot a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the ninth hole on Friday morning.
That journey, and the way their energy seems to flow from and to the noisy crowd consolidates the certainty that they are the players to beat Sunday, and there would be no more popular player of Fleetwood or Molinari to seal a possible European victory while the sun sets on Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time on different holes.
However, the speeches of European glory are still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson soon made it to Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning's four-ball, when he was in pair with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double bogets on the first nine holes smothered the Spanish and Swedish in a hole from which they did not even get far back.
However, on Sunday there is no one to help you get out of your hole.
Fourballs and forsomes are so fascinating to observe closely because of the interactions between couples, advice that they give and that they don't give and how the strategy can change in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has gained an important advantage in the final day but this foursome session has shown that the US team has the courage to fight, which some, in particular Stateside, have doubted.
Europe with a 10-6 advantage on Ryder Cup's final day
Europe will have a strong advantage in the final day of the Ryder Cup after finishing the matches of fourball and forsome Saturday with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
The inspired couple composed by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two wins on a Tiger Woods in difficulty to bring the score to Le Golf National so far to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, in an attempt to preserve the lost trophy in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated on an irregular American team in the morning's fourball, winning 3-1.
The U.S. had more resistance in the forsommas, winning two matches, but they failed to recover the disadvantage.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from 12 Sunday individual matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European leader to win four points of row while he and Molinari, known as "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points from the four opening games in Ryder Cup history.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed into fourballs, they worked superbly to beat down a fallen Woods and the American leader Bryson Dechambeau with an even cleaner 5&4.
Woods, who dragged for two games on Saturday, showed occasional explosions of genius but lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourballs and forsomes and seven rows.
Justin Rose, at rest during the morning's ovenball, went back to the side of partner Henrik Stenson in the forssomes to beat 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - number one and three of the world's rankings.
However, Europe has not achieved all the results expected in a pleasant and ventilated day south-west of Paris.
The three times great winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the reference for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a fierce 2&1 victory on Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in fourball and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIllroy 4&3 in foursomes, having lost the two opening holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup a team has returned from a four-point waste passing to individuals, although as the owner, Furyk's team only needs a draw to defend the trophy.
After having been the best seconds for two days, however, a Sunday counterattack seems to be out of their reach.
North Korea absolutely refuses to unilateral disarmament without confidence
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea declared to the United Nations on Saturday that the maintenance of sanctions was undermining the country's confidence in the USA, that under these circumstances he would absolutely refuse to give up his nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yong Ho stated at the General Assembly of the world body that North Korea has adopted "significant measures of goodwill" over the past year, such as the stop to nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of the site for nuclear tests and the commitment to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We do not, however, see any answer as consistent by the US," he said.
"Without confidence in the USA there will be no security in our national security and in these circumstances we absolutely refuse to disarm ourselves unilaterally first."
Although Ri has reused the regret notes concerning Washington's resistance to a "in-phase" denuclearization with which North Korea would be awarded on the basis of gradual actions, his statement was important because he did not completely refuse unilateral denuclearization as done in the past by Pyongyang.
He referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump during the first absolute meeting between a US president in office and a North Korean leader, held in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim undertook to work towards the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised guarantees of North Korean security.
North Korea sought a formal end-to-end agreement to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States claimed that Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also opposed appeals to ease the strict international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The US insists on the need to "have denuclearization first" and increase the pressure level with sanctions to achieve their purpose coercively and even oppose the "war-end declaration," said Ri.
"The idea that sanctions can put us on our knees is an illusion of those who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions is increasing our distrust."
Ri did not refer to programmes of a second meeting between Kim and Trump that the US leader announced at the UN at the beginning of the week.
On the other hand, the minister stressed the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If the counterpart of this issue of denuclearization was South Korea and not the USA, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be at this point dead."
But also, the tone of Ri's speech was significantly different from last year's speech to the UN General Assembly, when he stated that it was inevitable to target US territory with North Korea missiles after "the president of evil" Trump had called Kim a "missile man" engaged in a suicide mission.
Before the United Nations Trump, who last year had threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, he praised Kim for his courage to undertake the disarmament path, but said that much has to be done and that the sanctions will remain in force until the denuclearization of North Korea.
Wednesday Trump said he didn't have a deadline, saying that "if it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should award Pyongyang for the actions taken.
However, the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared on Thursday to the UN Security Council: "The respect of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue with force and without exception until complete, final and determined denuclearization is achieved."
The Security Council unanimously supported the sanctions to control North Korea in 2006 in an attempt to stifle the funding of nuclear programmes and ballistic missiles.
Pompeii met with Ri at the margins of the UN General Assembly and later declared that he would visit Pyongyang again the following month to prepare a second summit.
Pompei visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip did not go well.
He went back from Pyongyang in July stating that progress had been made, but a few hours after North Korea had accused him of presenting "gangster demands."
North Korea had committed itself during a meeting this month with Moon to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the US had adopted "conforming measures."
He stated that Kim had explained to him that the "conformity measures" he wanted were security assurances that Trump had committed himself to Singapore and actions towards a normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has pushed all its students to sleep more in an attempt to counter the growing virile culture of studying for entire nights fueled by caffeine.
One university scholar found that university students number one in the world often have no idea of the basic concepts of taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the course, which he considers to be the first of this type in the USA.
He had the idea of starting the course after a conference that had given the impact of sleeplessness on learning.
"At last a girl came to me and said to me, 'Why is this only now, when I'm in the last year?'
He said that no one had ever told him anything about the importance of sleep, which surprised me very much," he told The Telegraph.
The course, delivered for the first time this year, explains to students the essential concepts of how good sleep-related habits can help academic and athletic performance as well as improve general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Director General of Health Services at the University, said that the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students suffered from a severe sleeplessness during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive activities.
In a section there is the image of a dormitory room, where students can select cups of coffee, tents, gymnastics shoes and books to be able to know the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is influenced by sleeplessness, and the importance of a night routine.
In another section, participants are explained how the lack of long-term sleep can increase the risks of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, therefore encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes," added Prof. Czeisler.
The culture of pride linked to the "white night to study", still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students lead to the lack of sleep being a constantly growing problem.
Sleeping enough and with a good quality sleep should be the "secret weapon" of the students to fight stress, fatigue, anxiety, explained and should even serve to avoid fattening because the lack of sleep brings the brain in an unprecedented way, making people constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student enrolled in the faculty of chemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler develop the course, after having attended one of his lessons last year in Harvard.
He explained that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to promote a course aimed at the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, will be to ask all graduates to follow a similar study programme before enrolling in this competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler advised students to set up a wake for when they need to go to bed, as well as for when they need to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can send the circadian rhythm into tilt, leading to sleeping problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal takes down Gerard's men
The Rangers suffered another attack of depression from outside the house with the goal of Dolly Menga relegating Steven Gerrard's disarticulated team to a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The team of Ibrax was looking for the first out-of-home win since the 4-1 win in St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team beat Gerrard's second defeat in 18 matches by coach leaving his team eight points away from the leaders of Ladbrokes Premiership, Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before the interval and a short-inspired Rangers training never seemed able to match.
While the Ranger now descends to sixth place, the Livingston climbs to third place, and only behind the Hibernian by difference of goal.
And there could be further problems coming up for the Rangers after the Calum Spence watchman was cured for a head injury due to an object apparently launched from the outside.
Gerard made eight shifts to the team, which quickly exceeded Ayr in the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, chose the usual training that took a point at Hearts last week and would have been satisfied with the way his well-prepared team suffocated their opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have mastered for possession of a ball but Livingston has made better use of the balls at his disposal.
They could have scored just after two minutes when Menga's leaking passage first sent Scott Pittman ahead of Allan McGregor's door but the midfielder wasted the opportunity.
A deep punishment football by Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett but his companion in defense Alan Lithgow was only able to pull aside on the second pole.
The Rangers took control but there seemed to be more hope than conviction in their game in the area of rigor.
Alfredo Morelos certainly considered it necessary to see a rigour at the end of the fifteenth following a clash with Steven Lawless but referee Steven Thomson ignored Colombian requests.
The Rangers managed to shoot only twice in the door in the first time but the former carrier of Ibrox Liam Kelly did not get worried about the head shot of Lassana Coulibaly and a soft shot of Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingston's opening goal at the 34th minute may have been unexpected, no one can deny that he deserved it only because of his commitment.
Again the Rangers failed to manage a football placed deep in Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher leaked the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm in choosing Menga for a clean conclusion.
Gerard acted during the interval replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the change had an almost immediate impact because the wing stuck a ball in Morelos, but the exceptional Kelly threw himself off the doorline to block it.
But Livingston continued to drag visitors into exactly the type of game they love, with Lithgow and Halkett who collected a long ball after the other.
Holt's team might have increased the detachment in the final stages, but McGregor opposed to stopping Jacobs before Lithgow pulled out of the corner.
Rangers Glenn Middleton's replacement filed one last request for rigor after a cross with Jacobs but Thomson denied it again.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Almanac "Sunday Morning": 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today and the CONTEGIO continues... the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that made the device known as Geiger counter.
Since then, the Geiger counter has also become a pillar of pop culture, when in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," interpreted by those unbelievable cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It is a Geiger counter, used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on these earphones you can really feel the effects of the atoms released from radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "That's a bit of a blow now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention bearing his name continues to live.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, and their alteration in the laboratory
They can therefore "see" a protein common to many types of tumours and are then reinjected
An experimental test of this vaccine is giving promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine teaching the immune system to recognize malignant cells has seen her ovaries disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and their alteration in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to many types of cancer, called HER2, and therefore these cells are reinjected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the US National Cancer Institute based in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
Her2 protein "promotes the growth of different types of cancer", including breast, ovaries, lungs, and colon-rect, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar procedure for the extraction of immune cells from patients to "teach" them how to affect tumour cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West throws into a pro-Trump slide wearing a MAGA (Make America Great Again) cap after his appearance on SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was flogged in the studio during a Saturday Night Live bet after an inconclusive performance during which he praised the President of the USA Donald Trump and stated that he would apply in 2020.
After playing his third song of the evening, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a MAGA cap, he began a rage against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"Many times I talk to white people and they say to me, "How you like Trump, he's a racist!"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he explained.
The SNL started the show with a scene whose protagonist was Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Justice Commission against allegations of sexual violence presented by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it has not been transmitted, the recording of West's filippic was loaded on social media by the comic Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to play West with the publication.
In addition, West complained to the public about having had a bad time in the backstage because of its cover.
"They boiled me in the backstage.
They told me not to go out with that hat on.
I've been bullied!
And so they told me I'm an outcast," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see the submerged place?" and said, "I'd wear Superman's coat because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go ahead?
Try the love."
His comments generated whistles at least twice by the public and the members of the SNL cast seemed embarrassed, said Variety, with a person who told the magazine: "A deadly silence has fallen in the studio."
West had been invited as a replacement for the last minute of singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller had died a few days earlier.
West has bewildered many with a performance of song I Love it, disguised as Perrier's bottle.
West received support from the head of the Conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: FREE TO HAVE TESTED TO MASS."
But the conductor of the Karen Hunter show tweeted that West was just "what it is and that's just wonderful."
"But I chose NOT to reward someone (buying his music or his clothes or supporting his "art") that I believe is embracing a repulsive ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And so are we," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was now "the person previously known as Kanye West."
This is not the first artist to have changed his name and is following the steps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper friend, Snoop Dogg was called Snoop Lion and of course the music legend disappeared Prince, who had changed his name to a symbol and therefore in the artist previously known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder for stabbing in a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in Belfast east Friday.
The accident occurred in Ballyhackamour, according to the police.
The accused must appear at the Belfast Pretoria on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Spade Throne Star Kit Harington Attacks Toxic Masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as combatant Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series Spade Throne.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the male hero, claiming that such on-screen soils often make the kids believe that they have to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit claimed that "something went wrong" and thought about how to manage the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married the Spanish Throne co-star, 31 years old, admitted to worrying a lot about this problem.
'Personally I am worried, very much at the moment - what was our mistake with the masculinity?' he said.
'What have we taught men as they grew up in terms of the problem we now observe?'
Kit believes that television could be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity thanks to its extremely male characters.
He continued: 'What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on TV, and on the streets, that makes young people think they should be in this particular way of being human?
I think this is one of the great dilemmas of our time - how can we change things?
'Cause obviously something went wrong for young people.'
During the interview he also admitted that he will not interpret any prequel or sequel of Trono di Spade after finishing the series next summer, claiming that he had "finished with battlefields and horses".
Starting in November, Kit will play the main role in the revival of True West by Sam Shepard, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he considers meeting with his wife Rose the best thing that happened with the Sword Throne.
"I met my wife during this series, so she gave me in this way my future family, and my life from now on," she explained.
Rose played Ygritte, the object of Jon Snow's love, the character of Kit, in the fantasy series winning the Emmys.
The couple married in June 2018 at the Leslie family farm in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by these diseases, according to sources of health authorities.
About 40,000 new cases have been reported already in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases are due to sexual transmission, which marks a change from the past.
In some regions of China HIV has spread in the past as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who have contracted HIV in this way has declined to almost zero, as stated by the Chinese health authorities during a conference in Yunnan Province.
Year after year, however, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 units.
The transmission of HIV by sex is an urgent problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still widespread.
Because of the country's traditional values, some studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are caused by inadequate protection during sexual relations within these relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government promised universal access to anti-HIV drugs as part of its commitment to managing the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of the staff has leaked the data of the GOP senators, and speaks of "dangerous bogies" and "conspiracy theories".
On Saturday, the U.S. deputy denounced the charges against a member of her staff regarding the publication of personal information by three US Republican senators in the Wikipedia pages of the legislators.
The Democratic Member of Los Angeles stated that the statements were promoted by opinionists and websites of the " ultra-right wing".
"Bugies, lies and still despicable lies" said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The published information would include the home addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was published online on Thursday, issued by an anonymous of the Campidoglio during a hearing of a committee of experts on charges of sexual violence against the candidate for Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with the Waters office and released information concerning a member of the Waters staff.
"This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these false and trendy accusations, has in no way been responsible for the escape of such information.
This false accusation is totally false and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly generated online criticism from the former press secretary of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
"This lie is furious," wrote Fleischer.
"This implies that he does not have the character to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he hasn't done, he doesn't have to be angry.
It doesn't have to be provocative.
You must not question the prosecutor's reasons.
It must remain calm and quiet."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the criticism of Democrats to Judge Kavanaugh, who had been accused by detractors of looking too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate on the run to remove Waters in midterm elections, expressed his views on Twitter.
"Great if confirmed," tweeted.
In its statement, Waters stated that its office has alerted "the competent authorities and the forces of the order of these biased claims.
"We will ensure that those responsible are exposed," he continued, "and that they must respond to all their dangerous and harmful actions for all my staff members."
Johnny English review still hits - the parody of the spy with a undersized Rowan Atkinson
It has now become customary to look for references to Brexit in every new film with a British touch and this seems to apply to this revival of Johnny English's action comedy, which began in 2003 and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English - The Renaissance.
Will the veil of self-irony on the subject of how much trash we do be the new export opportunity of the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English from the rubber face and the eyes out of the orbits got his license to mess things up for the second time - and his name indicates more than anything that is a comical creation developed for countries of non-English cinema producers.
Obviously it is the foolish secret agent who despite his strange glamour claims has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr Bean and a pinch of that guy who contributed with a single note to Gloria's moments theme of the London 2012 Olympic Games Opening Ceremony.
This is a character based initially on the mysterious international traveler and man who once Atkinson played in Barclaycard's forgotten television ads, which left chaos behind him.
There are one or two nice moments in this last release of Johnny English.
I liked Johnny English who approaches the helicopter wearing a medieval armor and the propellers briefly fray against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is obvious, but humor seems quite undersized and strangely superfluous, especially now that "seri" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible now offer comedy as an ingredient.
Humour seems directed to children rather than to adults and to me the crazy adventures of Johnny English are not so original and targeted as the gags of Atkinson's silent films when he plays Mr Bean.
The fact that Britain is in serious danger is now the premise of immutable topicality.
A computer hacker infiltrated the supersecret British spy web network, revealing the identities of all British agents in the field, with dismay of the officer in charge, a very small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the drop that breaks the vase for a presumptuous and tormented prime minister, who is already suffering from a tangle of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does his best with this character like Teresa May but there is not much to work on in the script.
Your intelligence advisors inform you that every single active spy has been compromised and will have to call someone who has already retired.
And this means that the misdirector Johnny English, who now works as a school principal in a chic establishment, but also teaches official lessons on how to be an undercover agent: here you can appreciate some nice gag, when English offers a school of rock spying course.
English is reviewed in Whitehall for an emergency briefing and meets with his former suffering partner Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, married to a submarine commander, a girl role of the high society where Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So the Batman and Robin of the disasters for His Majesty's secret services are again in action, to meet the beautiful mortal woman of Olga Kurylenko, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is falling dangerously into the network of the charismatic billionaire of technology that claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous adventures: disguised as waiters, they hang fire in a French restaurant; they trigger hell by smuggled into the luxury yacht of Volta and English creates pure anarchy while trying to use a mask of virtual reality to take care of the home of Volta.
All the scenes are certainly designed for the last sequence, but however daring and exuberant, there is a lot of children's TV throughout history.
Everything is modest enough.
And as it happened with Johnny English films, I couldn't help thinking: the British film industry couldn't assign Rowan Atkinson a role that would make his talent fair?
The Labour Party refuses to be drawing up a plan so that the British can work four days a week but be paid for five
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn is considering a radical programme that would allow British citizens to work four days a week, although paid for five.
The party would like the main companies to transfer the savings obtained with the revolution of artificial intelligence (IA) to workers by offering them an extra day of rest.
In this way employees could enjoy a three-day weekend, maintaining the same pay.
Some sources stated that the idea would be compatible with the Party's economic programme and with plans to tilt the country to the benefit of workers.
The shift to a four-day day was supported by the union congress as a way for workers to benefit from the evolving economy.
A senior member of the Labour Party stated at The Sunday Times: "By the end of the year it is expected to announce a revision of the political line."
"It will not happen overnight, but a four-day working week is an aspiration in line with the party's approach to the economic balance for workers, as well as its overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, since the Green Party promised a four-day working week in the 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration does not enjoy the unanimous support of the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day working week is not part of the party's political line and is currently not discussed."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell took advantage of last week's Labour Conference to detail his vision of a socialist revolution in the economic field.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from "faceless" and "speculators" in public service companies.
The shadow chancellor plans also imply that current shareholders of water distribution companies may not recover their entire stock package, since the Labour Government could implement "deductions" on the basis of behaviors considered illegal.
It also confirmed the plans to include employees in business boards and to create inclusive participation funds, so as to transfer 10% of the private sector's equity to employees, which end up putting themselves in annual dividends up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say "60 Minutes" if the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could make them change their mind
The FBI's investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh postponed the final vote for his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least one week, and raised doubts as to whether the findings of the government agency could influence any of the Republican senators in providing their support.
In an interview that will take place on Sunday, the correspondent of "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it is possible that the FBI will bring to light something that might induce them to change their mind.
Kennedy appeared to be more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said it while I went to the audience, I said, I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after what happened, who came out of that charge, I said, 'Did you do it?'
It has been resolved, determined, unequivocal."
Graham's vote, however, seems carved into the rock.
"I have clear ideas about Brett Kavanaugh and could resist a bomb-proof charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And whoever you named couldn't prove it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see anything new in change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and did something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event that sees the display of a remarkable star-carrying event and has an equally remarkable mission: to end poverty in the world.
At the seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people turning on the Great Lawn of Central Park not only to enjoy performances like those of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also an awareness about the real purpose of the event, that of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive a free ticket for the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert audience had to complete a series of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call or any other significant way that would help raise awareness about their goal of eliminating poverty.
But precisely, how successful has the Global Citizen Festival now been to 12 years to achieve its intended purpose?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is really a genuine way to persuade people to request an appeal for action, or is it just another example of the so-called "clicktivism"- people who feel they really make a difference simply by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has reported having recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters, engaged for a multitude of different purposes.
It states that these actions have helped to urge world leaders to announce commitments and policies of more than 37 billion dollars, aimed at influencing the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In the early years of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and ads arising from their actions, of which they have already been paid or used as funds at least $10 billion.
The group estimates that so far protected capital funds have had a direct impact on some 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and executives based in the United Kingdom, committed to "help children grow to the maximum of their potential", with the promise to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help eliminate malnutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizen just like you, we can make social injustice or malnutrition become a footnote in history," the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that, after more than 5,000 actions have been implemented calling on the United Kingdom to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government has announced the expansion of funds for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children through nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the FAQs on his website, he asked: "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and arduous journey - sometimes we frame and we will fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of those who will perform this year's event in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy to implement "a blockade" and hinder Russian energy exports - Secretary of the Interior
Washington may, "if necessary", use its own Navy to prevent Russian energy sources from being available on the market, including that of the Middle East, revealed the Secretary of the Interior of the United States of America Ryan Zinke, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russian involvement in Syria - in particular, where it is operating at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate for energy just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern fulcrum of Europe," he said.
And according to officials, there are ways and means to deal with them.
"The United States has the opportunity, thanks to the Navy, to ensure that water routes remain open and, if necessary, to implement a naval blockade, so that their energy is not placed on the market," he said.
Zinke turned to the defendants at the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that self-defines the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's strategies to negotiations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are, in fact, the same thing.
"The economic option on Iran and Russia is, more or less, to leverage and replace fuels," he said, referring to Russia as "little versatile", with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements were made because the Trump administration was involved in a mission to boost the export of its liquid natural gas to Europe, and to replace Russia, an option that for European consumers is absolutely the cheapest.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to pull itself out of North Stream 2, "unappropriate" gas pipeline project that, according to Trump, made Berlin "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has pointed out several times that the North Stream 2, gasted from 11 billion dollars, designed to double the capacity of the existing one up to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Cremlin objects that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak, following a meeting in Moscow in September with Rick Perry, Secretary for Energy of the United States.
The United States' position triggered the negative reaction of Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading organisation of Germany for industry, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), asked the United States to stay out of the energy policies of the European Union and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I see as a big problem the fact that a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI) following a recent meeting between the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take "in serious consideration" of applying for the Presidency in 2020, says the Senator of Massachusetts
The Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would take "serious consideration" of becoming president following the mid-term elections.
During a town assembly in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he had the opportunity to apply.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and put our bad government in place, and that means having a woman at the top," he said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will take seriously my candidacy as President."
During the Warren City Assembly he said his story about President Donald Trump, stating that he was "bringing this country in the wrong direction."
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren was explicit in criticizing Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, by him appointed to the Supreme Court.
Friday Warren wrote in a tweet: "It is natural that there is a need for an FBI investigation before the vote."
A survey published on Thursday, however, showed that the majority of Warren's voters themselves do not believe that they should run in 2020.
The 58% "probable" voters in Massachusetts stated that the senator should not compete, according to the survey by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32 percent supported such an application.
The survey gained greater support for a candidacy from former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% to support a potential candidacy and 48% to the contrary.
Other names of high-profile democrats discussed on a potential candidacy in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden stated that he will take an official decision by January, as reported by the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about post-traumatic stress disorder of Track Palin at Donald Trump's meeting
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September
He was arrested and charged for a case of domestic violence on Monday night
"What's happening to my son, what's going on after he's back, I can put him in touch with other families who experience the consequences of post-traumatic stress disorders and some of the injuries our soldiers return to," he told the public at a gathering for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said, of his son and other veterans of war, "turn a little different, hardened, wondering if there is that respect for which their fellow soldiers and pilots, and every other member of the army, have consecrated themselves to the country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of assault and domestic violence on a woman, which interferes with a relationship for domestic violence and possession of firearms under drugs, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 States and the District of Columbia support the challenge for new asylum policies
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal battle against a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims on the run from gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and District of Columbia Friday presented an amicus curiae memory in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged this policy, as reported by NBC News.
The full name of the complainant in the call Grace v. Sessions that the American Union for Civil Liberties presented in August against federal policy was not revealed.
He stated that his partner "and his violent gang members" abused her, but United States officials rejected his application for asylum on 20 July.
She's been put on hold in Texas.
The prosecutors supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum candidates in the United States, as nations facing problems with gang and domestic violence.
The new United States asylum policy reversed a decision taken in 2014 by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed immigrants to apply for asylum without documents fleeing from domestic violence.
On Friday the Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, stated that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
"Federal law requires that all asylum applications be judged on the basis of specific circumstances and circumstances of the request, and such a prohibition violates that principle," says the amicus curiae memory.
In memory the prosecutors also objected that the policy that bans the entry of immigrants damages the economy of the United States, asserting the clear probability that they will become entrepreneurs and "provide necessary labour".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims on the run from domestic abuse and gang violence.
" Asylum is accessible to those who leave the country of origin because of persecution or fears due to race, religion, nationality, belonging to certain social groups or for a political opinion," said Sessions on 11 June, in the context of the announcement of the political line.
Asylum has never been thought to alleviate every problem -- even all the serious problems -- that people have to face every day around the world.
Desperate attempts to recover in Palu while the dead budget doubles in the race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation became increasingly desperate.
"There's a lot of tension," said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, while she was comforting her little sick child in an evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
"At every moment there's an ambulance carrying bodies.
Clean water is scarce."
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, rubbing among their fragile personal effects, in an attempt to recover anything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were full.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, victim of a shoulder and back fracture, were resting outside Palu's military hospital, where the patients were being treated outside because of the constant shocks of harassment.
His eyes were filled with tears as he recounted the feeling given by the violent earthquake that shook the room he shared with his wife and daughter on the fifth floor of a hotel.
"There was no time to save us.
"I was crushed among the debris on the wall, I believe," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife scream for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to you and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
The US ambassador accuses China of "making prepowers" with "advertising propaganda"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement on an American newspaper, advertising the benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using American press to advertise.
Last Wednesday, President Donald Trump referred to the announcement paid by China Daily in Des Moines Register - the newspaper with the highest sales in Iowa state - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the US Congressional elections of 6 November, an accusation that China rejects.
Trump's accusation regarding Beijing's attempt to get involved in the US elections marked what U.S. officials reported to Reuters was a new phase of Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
While for foreign governments it is normal to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in a escalating commercial war which has seen them adapt their duties to their respective imports.
China's retaliation duties at the beginning of the commercial war were designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa, who supported Trump's Republican Party, as Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, United States Ambassador to China and previously long-standing Governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods in China, said Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, wrote Branstad in an opinion article in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "now increases those pre-potences by publishing advertising on our free newspapers."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the beloved American tradition of freedom of speech and press, placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"Viceversa, in the booklet on the road here in Beijing you will find few dissident voices and you will not see any real reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese population might have on the problematic economic trajectory of China, since the media are under the firm fist of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers has eluded the offer to publish" his article, although it did not state what newspaper it is.
The Republicans are alienating the female electorate before mid-term elections with the Kavanaugh case, they warn analysts
Since many leading Republicans defend the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court and are on his side in dealing with various charges for sexual harassment, analysts have indicated that there will be a negative reaction, especially on the part of women, during future elections of half term.
The unrest in this regard has been extremely high, and many Republicans have already officially shown that they want to continue with a vote.
"You cannot withdraw these things," said The Hill Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake's last minute insistence on an FBI investigation would be sufficient to placate angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it neither tomorrow nor November," said Friday, according to the newspaper Washington, D.C., Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior consultant and national spokesperson of the progressive group MoveOn.
On Friday morning the protesters repeated the slogan "November is coming!" during their protest in the Senate Chamber, when the Republicans who control the Judicial Commission chose to continue with Kavanaugh's candidacy despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, as reported by Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of Democrats are going to the stars," said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst at the news site.
"People say they were already tall; it's true.
But they could be higher, especially among the undecided electricians of the suburbs and young voters, between the ages of 18 and 29, who often do not vote despite not liking the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony, which provided details of his allegations of sexual harassment against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts had assumed that a negative reaction might have occurred if the Republicans had continued with the confirmation.
"For the GOP it became a confusing set," declared at the beginning of last week Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, according to NBC News.
"It is not only about the vote for the committee, about the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be put on the bench, it is also about how the Republicans managed the situation and how they dealt with it," noted Guy Cecil, director of priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats.
In any case, Americans seem to be somehow divided between the person to believe as a result of the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a lower percentage in favour of the latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of the interviewees have definitely or probably believed in Ford's testimony, while 35% declares that they have certainly or probably believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
After Flake's insistence, the FBI is currently conducting investigations into the charges brought by Ford, as well as at least one of the other accusers, Deborah Ramirez, as reported by The Guardian.
Last week Ford testified under oath, before the Senate Judicial Committee, that Kavanaugh visited him in the state of Judaism when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez argues that the candidate for the Supreme Court exposed her genitals during a party during studies in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a New Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that takes its origins from Berners-Lee's open source Solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and what people can access and what information to.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is to "dominate the world".
"We have to do it now," he said of the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their "online personal data store" or a POD.
It can include lists of contacts, things to be done, calendars, musical libraries and other personal and professional instruments.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available on one browser and at the same time.
The uniqueness of the online personal data store is that it is entirely up to the user to choose who can access what type of information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to John Bruce, CEO of the company, is to provide adequate resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers in the staff hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology programmers from around the world will be able to give life to their decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team will not tell "Facebook and Google whether or not to introduce a complete change where their business models are completely removed from one day to another.
"We're not asking their permission."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps to protect the integrity and quality of the new web built from Solid".
In 1994 Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even after the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Manager of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Commemorated the Ecclesiastical of the Great War with Victoria Cross
The Church of England alone to be awarded a Victoria Cross during World War I as a fighter was commemorated in its hometown after 100 years.
The lieutenant colonel, Reverend Bernard Vann, was granted recognition on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaukort.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper and never knew he had obtained the highest level of British military honour.
On Saturday in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, his two grandchildren inaugurated a memorial slab.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "magnificently symbolic" the fact that the stone would be inaugurated exactly 100 years ago by his grandfather's award-winning prowess.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battalion beyond the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a dense fog, under the heavy fire of the field and war machines".
Then he rushed to the line of fire and with the "greatest gallery" advanced the line before having run with a single-handed cannon and landed three of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I can never be up to and something that makes him more humble."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid down a crown of flowers after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "he felt really honored to play a role in the parade" and added "the value of a real hero is demonstrated by the support he will be given by many people."
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, and instead they caught Peppa Pig
Imagine, you stayed awake all night to watch the famous Bellator 206 only to see you denied the vision of the main event.
The program from San Jose included 13 fightings, including the six on the main card, and was to be broadcast in the UK during the night, live on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were getting ready to fight, viewers in the United Kingdom were stucco when Peppa Pig appeared on the screen.
Some remained grounded after being awake until the first hours of the morning specifically for combat.
On Twitter a fan described the move to the cartoon for children as "a sort of joke of bad taste".
"The government regulation provides that at six o'clock in the morning that content was no longer appropriate, so we had to move on to programming for children," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of Bellator for marketing and communication, when asked for transmission.
"Peppa the pig," "yes."
"The president of the company Bellator, Scott Coker, said they will work on programming to include viewers from the UK in the future.
"I think when I think about replay, I think we can probably find a solution," Coker said.
"But there are six in the morning Sunday and we will not be able to find a solution before Sunday of our time zone, Monday for them.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed, a lot of messages arrived and nobody was friendly.
We were trying to solve the problem, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I promise you next time it won't happen.
We will limit it to five fights instead of six - as we normally do - and we have tried to get so much for fans, and we have just discussed it.
It's an unpleasant situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "low" because of sexuality
The Olympic swimmer Tom Daley says he has grown sentences lower than anyone because of his sexuality - but this has provided him with the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize until he got to high school, the fact that "not everyone is like me".
Speaking in the first episode of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he had made his voice feel about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also stated that being a parent made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
The usual presenter of the old date program, Kirsty Young, took a series of months free for sickness.
Presenting himself as an outcast in Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "less than" anyone else as he grew up because "it was socially unacceptable that he liked both boys and girls."
He said, "Today, the feeling of feeling less than, and feeling different, was the things that really gave me strength and energy to succeed."
He wanted to try to be "something," he said, so as not to disappoint anyone if they had discovered his sexuality by chance.
The two-time bronze medal at the Olympics has become a high-profile LGBT activist and has used its face in this year's Australian Commonwealth Games to appeal to several countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he had made his voice heard because he felt fortunate to be able to live openly without consequences and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The three times world champion said that the fact that he fell in love with a man - the American director Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013- "he caught me by surprise".
Daley married Oscar's winner, who was 20 years older than him last year, but said the age difference was never a problem.
"When you pass so many in your youth" - he went to his first Olympics when he was 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar heights and lows.
The two became parents in June, of a child named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole perspective" has changed.
"If you asked me last year, it was all about the fact that I had to win a gold medal," he said.
"You know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 years after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father had not accepted the fact that he was about to die and that one of the last things he asked was if they already had tickets to London 2012 - because he wanted to stay in the front line.
"I couldn't tell him you won't be around here to be in the front row, Dad," he said.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and until he actually stopped and died, I had not yet realized that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics, winning the bronze.
"I only knew it was what I had dreamed for my whole life - swimming in front of a home audience in the Olympic Games, there was no feeling better," he said.
This also inspired the choice of his first song - Heather Small Proud - which had a special meaning for him in the preparation for the Olympics and still makes him come the goose skin.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
The out form Mickelson put on the bench in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will score a record on Sunday when he will play his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to get back in shape to avoid becoming an infertile billion-stone.
Mickelson, playing in the biennial event for a twelfth record, was put on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk for the fourballs and the forsomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the heart of the action, as was often the case with the United States, the five-time champion spent the day between cheerleading and working on his own game in the range, in the hope of correcting what storms him.
Since he has never been the strongest driver even at the top of his career, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the difficult Le Golf National, where the disconnected path regularly punishes the wrong strokes.
And if the path itself was not discouraging enough, Mickelson, in the ninth match on Sunday, faces the accurate champion of the British Open Francesco Molinari, who collaborated with the novice Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If Americans, with four points below the beginning of their 12 single matches, start with a hot start, Mickelson's match could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his own man, not that he could say much more.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a pack on his shoulder, put an arm around me and said he'll be ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
It is a Hall of Famer and has added so much to the teams in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing two games.
I had imagined more, but that's the way it went, and that's the way we thought it would go.
He wants to participate, just like anyone else."
Mickelson Sunday will exceed Nick Faldo's record for most games played in the Ryder Cup.
It could mark the end of a career in the Ryder Cup that has never even far mirrored the heights of its personal record.
Mickelson has 18 games won, 20 defeats and seven draws, although Furyk said his presence has brought intangible assets to the team.
"It's fun, sarcastic, sharp, he likes to play with people, and he's a great guy to have in the meeting room," he explained.
"I also believe that the younger players have had fun cementing themselves against him this week, something that was fun to watch.
He did much more than play"
The captain of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, knows that a good advantage can vanish soon
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows from experience that a considerable advantage in the individual meetings of the last day of Ryder Cup can easily turn into a uncomfortable pursuit.
The Danish debuted at the 1997 meeting in Valderrama where the team, captained by Seven Ballesteros, despite a five-point detachment from the Americans, reached the finish line with a minimum advantage, winning 141⁄2-131/2.
"I keep repeating that we had a good advantage in Valderrama, we had it in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won, but little by little," said Bjorn (in the photo) after seeing the 2018 class win, Friday for 5 to 3 and yesterday for 10 to 6, in Le Golf National.
"So it will be history to prove to me and my team that it is not over.
Tomorrow we have to give our best.
We need to go out there and do everything the right way.
It's not over until the points are marked in the sink.
Our goal is to try to win the trophy, and that is what we need to focus on.
I always focus on the 12 players on my team, but I know who's on the other side: the best golfers in the world."
Happy the way his men competed in that difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never have overcome myself.
Tomorrow's a different challenge.
Tomorrow is the turn of individual performances, which is another thing.
It's nice to be there with a teammate when things go well, but when you're just your golfer skills are put to the test.
This is the message you need to send to the players: tomorrow, you have to get the best out of yourself.
Then forget about your partner because he must also go there and get the best of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, counterpart Jim Furyk will seek in its players the best individual performance more than team performance, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who collected three out of four points.
Furyk himself was found by both sides at those big meetings of the last day, having been part of the winning team in Brookline before losing against the European "Miracle of Medina".
"I remember every single word," he commented in response to the question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, led his players in the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but we want to leave immediately with the right foot as we did in Brookline and Medina.
When the game begins to take a certain fold, the pressure increases in intermediate matches.
So we organize our training accordingly and classify the boys as appropriate, because tomorrow we will try to do a magic.
Thomas was given the task of driving the counteroffensive and facing Rory McIllroy in the top match with, in order, other Europeans, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, in the first half.
"I chose this order because I think it covers the path to the end," Bjorn said about his selection for individual meetings.
Germany's new military vessel has been postponed again
According to local media, the latest German military fleet was supposed to have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the old military ships of the times of the Cold War, but there won't be until next year at least due to defective systems and an overcrowded cost.
The Rheinland-Pfalz commission, the admiral ship of the new frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper quoting a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the military Navy in 2014, but worrying issues after delivery have tormented the fate of the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Württemberg class ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old ships of the Bremen class.
They will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft missiles as well as some hidden technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic markings.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, in fact it should be possible to use the new frigates up to two years away from national ports.
However, the continuous delays imply that the innovative warships, which are said to allow Germany to project its overseas power, will already become obsolete when they come into service, notes the Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F-125 thing made news last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the ship yard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned a ship to the manufacturer after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the refund, but the German media noticed a number of crucial "misleading software and hardware" that made the ship useless if used in a combat mission.
The shortcomings in the software were particularly important as the ships of the Baden-Württemberg class will be managed by a crew of about 120 sailors, just half of the staff of the oldest ships of the Bremen class.
Furthermore, it has emerged that the ship weighs heavily too much, and this reduces its performance and limits the military's ability to add future updates.
Rheinland-Pfalz, of 7,000 tonnes, is thought to be twice as heavy as vessels of similar classes used by Germans in World War II.
Apart from defective hardware, the cost of the entire project (including crew training) is becoming an important issue.
It seems that it has reached €3.1 billion (US$3.6 billion) from the initials €2.2 billion.
The problems involving the new outbreaks become of particular importance in the light of recent alarms concerning the reduction of German naval power.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Parliamentary Commissioner for the Armed Forces, admitted that the military Navy actually "carries ships capable of being employed".
The official has stated that the issue has worsened considerably over time, since the old unarmed ships have not been replaced by new ships.
His regret is that none of the baden-Württemberg class frigates were able to join the military Navy.
National Trust spies on bats' secret life
New research carried out in a Scottish Highland estate aims to reveal how bats use the view to obtain food.
It is confident that discoveries can shed light on the behaviour of the only existing flying mammals and guide future protection activities.
The study of the scientists of the National Trust for Scotland will follow common bats and soprano, in addition to the brown ears and Daubenton bats at the Inverewe Gardens, in Wester Ross.
Special registrators will be placed in key locations around the property to track bat activity during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile investigations using portable detectors.
The sound analyses recorded by an expert will determine the frequency of bat calls and how each species behaves.
A habitat map and a report will be produced to create a detailed framework on the scale of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, an adviser for the protection of nature for the NTS, hopes that the results can reveal which areas of habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of grasslands, and how to best maintain bat forests and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom declined considerably in the last century.
bats are at risk due to construction and development works that affect trespoles and ruin habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also constitute a threat, as well as mosquito paper and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks of domestic cats.
The bats aren't really blind.
However, because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than eyes when it comes to gripping a prey.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to identify insects and obstacles to their path.
The NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
Ten qualified experts regularly conduct investigations, inspect trespolies and sometimes perform rescues.
The organization has even established Scotland's first reserve for bats only at the estate of Three, in the region of Dumfries and Galloway, which houses eight of the ten species of bats of Scotland.
The estate manager, David Thompson, states that the property is the ideal territory.
"Here in Three we have a vast area for bats," he said.
"We have the ancient buildings, many secular trees and a good habitat.
But there's a lot about bats that we don't know yet, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us understand more about their need for growth."
Stresses the importance of controlling bats before conducting maintenance within the properties as it is possible that the involuntary destruction of a single maternal trespola can kill up to 400 females and small ones, perhaps sweeping away a whole local population.
The bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, harass them, disturb them or destroy their trestles.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish leader for the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
He said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don't know how their populations pass it."
Ronaldo rejects rape charges while lawyers sue the German weekly
Cristiano Ronaldo labeled rape charges against him as "false news", claiming that people "want to advertise themselves" with his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German weekly Der Spiegel who published the charges.
The Portuguese attacker of Juventus was accused of having raped an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel also announced on Friday the charge of the payment of 375,000 dollars to keep the silence on the event.
In a video on Instagram directed at its 142 million followers, in the hours following the charges, Ronaldo, 33 years old, has crushed the statements as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false," says the five times Golden Ball aimed at the camera.
"They want to advertise through my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by doing my name, but this is part of the game.
I'm happy and everything's fine," added the footballer smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's legal officers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel about the allegations, called "an inadmissible reporting of suspicions of the private sphere".
Lawyer Christian Schertz stated that the footballer will seek compensation for "moral damages to the extent that the breach of privacy is serious, considered, probably, one of the most serious personal rights of recent years."
The event would take place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a discotheque, Ronaldo and Majorga would have returned to the footballer's room, where he had been subjected to anal violence, as reported in the statements filed at the District Court of Clark County in Nevada.
Majorga claims that Ronaldo would kneel after the event saying that he was for the "99 percent" a "good boy" disappointed by the "one percent".
From the documents it emerges that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had a sexual relationship, but that this was consensual.
Majorga also states that she went to the police and the hospital, where her injuries were photographed, but later agreed to a conciliation agreement as she felt "terrorized by the retortions" and worried about the prospect of "coming publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old now tries to reverse the agreement, claiming to be still traumatized by the alleged accident.
Ronaldo was about to move to Real Madrid from Manchester United to the time of the event, and this summer he will join Italian Juventus with a 100 million euro contract.
Brexit: the United Kingdom will forever regret the loss of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom could "repair forever" the loss of its world leader status in car construction following Brexit, said the Minister of Greg Clark Industry.
He also added to be "concerned" for statements made by Toyota UK to the BBC on the possible exit of Britain from the EU without an agreement and the resulting temporary blockade of production in the factory of Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Minister Clark.
The Japanese car house claims that delays to borders, in the case of a Brexit without agreement, could affect jobs.
The factory in Burnaston, in which the Toyota Auris and Avensis are built, produced about 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which was exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I believe that if Britain leaves the EU by the end of March, production in our factory will stop," said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota in Burnaston.
I increase concern in other English car manufacturers for exit from the EU without agreement on the operation of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
The BMW, for example, claims that after Brexit it will close its Mini facilities in Oxford for a month.
The main concern concerns the risks in the supply chain encountered by manufacturers in the event of Brexit without agreement.
Toyota's production line is managed on the basis of the concept "just in time", with parts arriving every 37 minutes from English and European suppliers for cars on order.
If on 29 March the United Kingdom will leave the EU without an agreement, difficulties may arise at borders which would cause delays and lack of parties.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day of inventory value in its Derbyshire plant, said the company, so production would be stopped.
Minister Clark argues that Theresa May's plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely designed to avoid these inconveniences at borders".
"We need an agreement. We want to have the best agreement that will allow us to enjoy not only the current success but to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio's Today program 4.
"The test, not only from Toyota but also from other car manufacturers, is that we must be able to continue what was a successful distribution chain."
Toyota has not been able to say how long production could stop, but in the long run, it notes that additional costs could reduce the competitiveness of plants and potentially jobs.
Peter Tsouvalaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is responsible for the union delegates of the plant, says that the workers are deeply concerned: "According to my experience, once the jobs are reduced, they are no longer reintegrated".
A government spokesman said: "We have proposed a precise and credible plan for future relations with the EU".
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, says the White House.
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with Justice Deputy Minister Rod Rosenstein could be "remanded for a week," while the dispute on Judge Brett Kavanaugh continued, declared the White House Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller who investigates Russian interference with the elections, ties between Trump's advisors and Russia, and the possible obstacle to justice by the President.
The possibility that Trump could fire the Deputy Minister of Justice, thereby putting Mueller's independence at risk, fuelled Washington's gossip for months.
During the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was talking about wearing a comic book to record talks with Trump and trying to remove the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday he went to the White House and said he was going to resign.
Instead, it was announced by Wednesday a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he "would rather not" fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid overlap with the hearing of the Senate Justice Committee in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual violence, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week of instructing the FBI against Kavanaugh, further delaying the final vote of the Senate.
On Sunday, Trump's spokesman Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News.
Questioned about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "No date has been set, it could be this week, I guess it will be over another week considering everything that is happening with the Supreme Court.
But we will see and continue to update the press."
Some journalists might challenge this statement: Sanders does not hold a briefing with the press at the White House since 10 September.
Driver Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders claimed that the shortage of briefings is not due to an aversion to television journalists "who show themselves," although he said: "I do not disagree with the fact that they show themselves."
So it made me think that direct contact between Trump and the press could be more frequent.
"The president holds more questions and answers than any president before him," he said, adding without mentioning the evidence: "We have checked the figures."
The briefings will still be there, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it is much better than talking to me.
We try to do this, as in recent weeks, and this will replace briefings with the press and you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or attending open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president has probably proved his point, making a free-wheeled speech, and at the same time bizarre, in front of a group of journalists.
The Minister of Health writes to the Scottish NHS European workers to express his concerns about Brexit
The Minister of Health wrote to EU staff working at Scotland's NHS to express the country's gratitude and wish them to stay after Brexit.
The Scottish Member of Parliament Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months in advance of leaving the United Kingdom from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to meeting the costs of requests for settled status (stable resident status) for EU citizens working in decentralized public services.
In his letter, Minister Freeman writes: "All summer there have been ongoing negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on Brexit, which will lead to autumn decisions.
But the British Government has also prepared itself in the event of an unagreed scenario.
I know this is a time of great concern for all of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate my appreciation today for the contribution made by all staff, regardless of nationality.
Members from across the EU, and not only, bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, giving benefits to patients and communities to whom we offer a service.
Scotland is certainly your home and we strongly wish you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie was operated urgently following a head injury
The Tennessee State Tigers defender, Christion Abercrombie, was subjected to an emergency surgery after reporting a head injury in the Saturday match against the Vanderbilt Commodores where the team lost for 31 to 27, as reported by Mike Organ of the newspaper The Tennessee.
Technical Chief Rod Reed told journalists that the accident that caused the wound occurred shortly before the interval.
"He approached on the edge of the camp and fainted," Reed said.
The first aid staff and the medical staff administered oxygen on board the camp to Abercrombie before placing it in a barrel and taking it away for further verification.
A Tennessee State leader reported to Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie underwent surgery at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Harris added that "there's no news yet about the type and size of the damage" and that the Tennessee States are trying to figure out when he was injured.
Abercrombie, a second year student, is at his first season with the Tennessee States after moving to Illinois.
He had made a total of five plates before leaving the game, which brought his total season to 18 plates.
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp taxes for the purchase of property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp taxes for the purchase of property in the United Kingdom and the additional cash flow will be used to help homeless people, according to the new plans of the workers
The maneuver will neutralize Corbyn's success in attracting young voters
The increase in the stamp tax will be applied to taxpayers who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Treasury plans to collect up to £120 million a year to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp taxes for the purchase of property in the UK and the additional cash flow will be used to help homeless people, today announce Theresa May.
The maneuver will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's initiative to attract young voters with the promise to provide accommodation at a more affordable price and higher income.
The increase in the stamp tax will be applied to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the additional resources will be in support of the Government's initiative to combat the homeless.
The surplus, which is added to the current bubble tax, including the high levels introduced two years ago on the second houses and on the properties buy to lets ( purchased to be rented), could amount to more than 3%.
The Ministry of Treasury expects the maneuver to collect up to £120 million a year.
An estimated 13% of new constructions in London are purchased by non-resident citizens in the UK, increasing prices and making it difficult for buyers to enter a first house in the real estate market.
Many of the richest areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "phantom city" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the state.
The new policy came a few weeks after Boris Johnson had asked for a cut on the stamp tax to help younger people with the purchase of the first house.
He accused the large construction companies of maintaining the prices of real estate by taking over the land without using them and encouraged Prime Minister May to give up the allowances on affordable housing to settle the British "property".
Mr Corbyn announced an exciting series of proposals for reform of the housing market, including controls on rents and the elimination of innocent evictions.
He also wants to give the council more powers over the construction of new buildings.
Prime Minister May said: "Last year I said I would have committed myself to restoring the British dream, that is, that life should be better for the new generations.
And that means restoring the real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it would not be fair if the purchase of a house was equally easy for people who do not live in the United Kingdom and for foreign companies, as it is for British workers living in the United Kingdom.
For so many people the dream of owning a house has become too far away and the dignity of homeless people remains a reality."
Jack Ross: "My greatest aspiration is to drive Scotland"
Sunderland's Technical Director, Jack Ross, says that his "maximum aspiration" is to become a Scottish manager sooner or later.
The Scottish, 42 years old, is attracted by the challenge of raising the team from the North-East that is currently in third place in the League One, three points from the top.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after driving St. Mirren during the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a soccer player.
I've been in series B and that's all," Ross said to the Scottish BBC Sportsound program.
I grew up looking at Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child and it's something I'll always remember.
However, this will only be possible if I succeed as a team manager."
Ross' predecessors led by Sunderland were Dick Advocat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Alloa Athletic's former technician claims to feel no anxiety in following such important names, in an equally important team, having previously rejected Barnsley and Ipswich Town's proposals.
"The success for me right now is measured with the ability to bring the team back to the Premier League."
Considering the club's structure and facilities, we can say that it belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task, but I think I'll only succeed if I get the team back."
The start of Ross's manager career dates back to three years ago, after a period as coach assistant in Dumbarton and 15 months as a replacement heart coach.
He then helped Alloa save herself from the retrocession to the third level and brought St. Mirren from the edge of the retrocession to the title of champions of the Championship, the following season.
Ross claims to feel much more comfortable now than during his football career in the Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic teams.
"It was probably a real turning point," recalls Alloa's management.
"I really thought that the role of manager was right for me, more than the role of player.
Seems strange because I worked well, I earned a living, and I got some good results.
But playing can be hard.
There are many things you have to deal with weekly.
I still deal with them in terms of stress and work pressure, but management seems good.
I have always wanted to lead and now I do, I feel much more calm than I've ever been in my life."

The summer heat wave has brought more incasions to the English pubs in difficulty and more concern to catering services.
The data show that pubs and bars have seen an increase in sales from 2.7 percent in July, while the in cash of restaurants has fallen by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, of the CGA commercial consulting company, put together the data and commented: "The persistence of the sun and the long permanence of England to the World Cup made July to follow a path similar to that of June, when the pubs were above 2.8 percent, while the restaurants were hit harder.
The fall of 1.8 percent in the restaurant in June has worsened in July.
Pubs and bars in which you mostly drink were the strongest, with a homogeneous increase higher than the fall of restaurants.
Even the pubs in which you eat have suffered the heat, although not in an excessive way as the restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In the pubs and bars managed the sales of drinks are of 6.6 percent in the month, while the consumption of food has fallen of three percent".
Paul Newman, an analyst in the recreation and reception sector of RSM, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the main factor when it comes to selling in the retail market.
It is not surprising that restaurants continue to fight, although a decrease in sales of 4.8 percent per year will be particularly severe in addition to continuous pressure on costs.
The long hot summer could not have come in a worse period for restaurants and only time can tell if the most moderate temperatures, which we enjoyed in August, will give us a necessary truce".
The overall growth of sales between pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the decline in the roll-out of brands.
The sales monitoring company Coffer Peach Tracker for British pubs, bars and restaurants combines and analyzes performance data through 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of over £9 billion, and is the industry's reference company.
One out of five children has secret social networks accounts that hide their parents
A survey reveals that one child in five, some in only 11 years, has secret social networks accounts that hide parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in the pages "fake on Instagram"
The news has strengthened the fear that content is placed in the sexual background
20% of students said they had a "principal" account to show their parents
One child in five, some in only 11 years, creates accounts of social networks that keep adults hidden.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth of the accounts "fake on Instagram", a reference to the Instagram photo sharing site.
The news has strengthened the fear that they are placed contained in a sexual background.
Twenty percent of students claimed to run a "principal" clean account to show their parents while maintaining a private account.
A mother who discovered by chance the daughter's secret site 13 years old, found a teenager who urged others to "buy me."
The research, of the Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference (HMC) of private schools, showed that 40% of boys between 11 and 18 years old have two profiles, and half of them admitted to keeping private accounts.
HMC Director Mike Buchanan said: "It is alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be "voice for athletes" on the advice of Scottish Athletics
Eilidh Doyle was elected non-executive member of the Scottish Athletics Council during the National General Assembly of the Administrative Body.
Doyle is the most decorated Scottish athlete in the light athletics and President Ian Beattie described the appointment as a great opportunity for those who manage sport to benefit from his extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys a profound respect for the Scottish, British and World athletic community and we are sure that in Scotland athletics could get a huge advantage by bringing it into the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I look forward to acting as the voice of athletes and I hope that I can contribute and help guide sports in Scotland."
The American winner of the 1996 Atlanta Games and four Olympic Gold Medals, as well as now BBC opinionist, was unable to walk after a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
According to the doctors, only time would have been able to tell me if I had recovered and to what extent.
It was an exhausting job but I fully recovered, learned to walk again and today I move agilely!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!".
The advertising of a tyranny compares mothers and cows and divides the opinion online
A company producing a tyrillate has divided the opinion into a network with an advertising that compares the nursing mothers and the mountain cows.
To mark the launch of what is defined as the "first silent and wearable tyrillatte of the world", the consumer technology company Elvie launched an advertising in the form of funny music videos to show the freedom to express itself as mothers given by the new tyrillatte.
Four real mothers dance in a barn of cows on a track that includes songs like, "Yes, I'm taking my milk but I don't have one thing" and, "If I hadn't noticed it, these aren't moms but my boobs."
The choir continues: "Get him out, get him out, feed the kids, get him out, get him out, get my lords milk."
However, advertising, published on the company's Facebook page, has caused controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video elicited different reactions among the viewers, many of whom claimed that it highlighted the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
"A unfortunate decision to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they also have to stay pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except for the fact that their little ones are stolen from them a few days from birth," wrote someone.
The Elvie tyrillatte is worn discreetly under a mother's bra
Someone else commented: "Intelligently traumatic for both the mother and the child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a tyranny for mothers who will continue to hold their children?"
Someone else added, "It's really nonsense advertising."
Others have defended it and a woman even admitted to finding the song "fun."
"I think it's a great idea.
If I'm still breast-feeding, I'd like to have one.
When I used to use the tyranny, I felt just like a cow.
Advertising is a bit irreverent but it doesn't get far from reality.
This is a great product," someone wrote.
Another person commented: "This is a fun advertisement dedicated to mothers who use tyrillatte (often in the workplace or in the bathroom) and feel like "fowls".
Its purpose is not to praise or judge the home industry."
Finally, the protagonists of the video show that they danced with the discreet tyrillatte stuck in the bra.
The concept to which the campaign is inspired is based on the idea that many women who use tyranny feel like cows.
The Elvie tiralat is however completely silent, has no wires or tubes and can be stuck in a breast-feeding bra giving women the freedom to move, hold the children in their arms and even come out while they are milking.
Ana Balarin, mother's partner and ECD commented: "Elvie's tyrilatte is such a revolutionary product that deserved a bold and provocative launch.
Comparing the women who use tyrillatte to cows, we wanted to highlight all the challenges of this practice by demonstrating in a fun and easily recognizable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new tyralatte is able to secure."
This isn't the first time Elvie's tyrillatte's been reported.
During London's fashion week, the mother of two children appeared on the stylist Marta Jakubowski's walkway wearing this product.
Hundreds of migrant children have quietly moved into a tentoples at the borders of Texas
The number of migrant children increased exponentially even though the monthly crossings of the borders remained relatively unchanged, partly because the harsh rhetoric and political line of the Trump administration made it more difficult to rely on these children.
Most of those who took them into custody were usually illegal immigrants who are now afraid to jeopardise the possibility of staying in the country by offering to make such a move.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential trustees and other adult members of their families would have taken fingerprints and that the data would have been transmitted to the immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said in front of Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who offered to take on their own children.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no previous criminal records.
"Almost 80% of those who offer to take children into custody or belong to the families of these people are illegally in the country and most of them are foreign criminals.
We are therefore continuing to hunt these people," said Albence.
In order to try to process children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules for which some of them will have to appear in court within one month of the stop, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard period, according to what says who works at the reception points.
Many will appear in videoconference rather than in person, in order to justify their legal cause to an immigration judge.
Those who will be considered unfit for help will be expelled quickly.
The longer the children remain in trust, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety and depression that cause violent attacks of anger or attempts to escape, as they say who works at the reception points and the relationships that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Those who support this position say that the probability of this happening is even higher in a large structure such as that of Tornillo where, due to its size, it is easier that the signs of distress of children are ignored.
They add that the movement of children in the tendons without giving them the time to prepare emotionally or to greet friends could exacerbate the trauma that many are already facing.
Syria intimates US, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately
In his speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also invited Syrian refugees to return to their homeland, even though the war had now reached the eighth year.
Moualem, also serving as Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces occupy Syrian soil illegally under the pretext of combating terrorism and "will be treated accordingly".
"They must retire immediately without putting any condition," he said before the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where since 2011 there have been more than 360,000 deaths and millions of people have had to leave their homes.
He reiterated that Damascus will continue to "fight this holy war until it has freed all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who primarily train and support the Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the field in this country destroyed by the war.
On the problem of refugees, Moualem stated that the conditions are favourable to their return and accused "some Western countries" of "incubating unfounded fears" that push refugees away from their homeland.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to intervene to facilitate their return," he said.
"What should only be a humanitarian problem is politicized."
The United States and the European Union have warned that aid for reconstruction will not be made available in Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The United Nations diplomats claim that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a bearing zone in Idlib, the last major stronghold of the rebels, has created the opportunity to continue the political negotiations.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has avoided an extensive attack by the Syrian forces supported by the Russians in the province, where three million people live.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement has "necessary deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action will target the jihadists, including the Al-Nusra Front fighters connected with Al-Qaeda, who will "be eradicated".
The United Nations envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes that he will soon be able to convene a new committee of members of the government and the opposition to extend a draft constitution for post-war Syria and prepare the way for the elections.
Moualem set out the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee by stating that the work of the group must be limited to the "revision of the articles of the current constitution" without any interference.
'Cause Trump's gonna get the second term.
Based on this logic, Trump will be re-elected in 2020 unless, as many liberal spectators perhaps hope, his presidency should not conclude prematurely because of impeachment or scandal.
In what will undoubtedly be "the most dramatic end of the presidency ever!"
At the moment, there are no signs of bending of the spectators.
Since 2014, the percentages of the first night have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million spectators in the first night, significantly increasing compared to 1.7 million of four years ago, according to Nielsen, and the MSNBC program "The Rachel Maddow Show" exceeded the network's percentages by reaching 3.5 million spectators in the evenings with the most important news.
"It's a fire to which people are attracted because it's not something to explain," says Neal Baer, showrunner of the television series of ABC "Designed Survival" that tells the story of a cabinet member who suddenly becomes president after an attack that destroys the Campidoglio.
In Scovell, an expert writer of brilliant comedies and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
Remember a taxi ride to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he'd vote for Trump.
She asked him why.
He said, "Because it makes me laugh."
Chaos is therefore a source of fun.
Of course, unlike any other television program, the plot of Washington's events can determine the future of the Roe vs. Wade judgment, whether immigrant families will be able to meet or not and the state of health of the global economy.
Stop following the news is, however, a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
And yet it goes far beyond the duty of informed citizens to follow for the sixth consecutive hour a group of experts who discuss Bob Woodward's in-depth research into his book "Peara", of Paul Manafort's 15,000-dollar leather jacket ("a coat full of trance" commented The Washington Post) and the implications of the disgusting descriptions that Stormy Daniels makes of Trump's anatomical parts.
I, for example, will no longer be able to look at Super Mario without thinking about it.
"Part of the reason why what looks like a reality show is in the fact that every night there is news," says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of "Pawn Stars", about the endorsement of actors and daily developments of Trump's show plot (in contrast to N.F.L. that praises Kim Jong-un).
You can't miss an episode, otherwise stay back.
This week I went to find Mike Fleiss on the north coast of Kauai and although it was a sunny day with almost 30 degrees, it was closed at home to look at the MSNBC and while recording the CNN.
He couldn't get out of the TV, not while Brett Kavanaugh was dealing with the Senate's judicial committee and facing the future uncertainty of the Supreme Court.
Fleiss commented: "I remember when once we did all those absurd programs and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization."
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right."

Inflow of external money in the race for the narrowest elections of half mandate
It is no surprise that in the 17th district there is an influx of money due to the re-alignment of a Congressional District which has led to two members now running for the same place.
The recent redefinition of Pittsburg suburban district brought to the scene the democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won his place in another district during a special election held last spring.
Lamb is running against another member in office, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th District of Pennsylvania that overlaps to the new 17th.
The maps were redesigned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January deliberated that in the old districts the electoral colleges had been manipulated unconstitutionally in favour of the republicans.
The 17th District race triggered a campaign characterized by a fierce opposition between the financial branches of the two major parties, namely the Democratic Campaign Congressal Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a measurement victory in the March special elections for the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
That place had been occupied by a Republican for over a decade and President Donald Trump won the district for 20 points.
Political opinionists have given democrats a slight advantage.
The United States thought to penalize El Salvador because it supports China, then changed their mind
Diplomatics noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
In June 2017 a rather friendly meeting took place between the president of Panama Juan Carlos Varela and President Trump, who also had a hotel in Panama until the partners forced the Trump Organization's leading group to leave.
The officials of the State Department decided to include the heads of the American diplomatic missions from El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama following the "recent decision not to recognize Taiwan", said the spokesperson of the Heather Nauert department in a statement issued at the beginning of the month.
But the decision to apply sanctions was made only with regard to El Salvador, which in 2017 received approximately $140 million in aid from the Americans for the control of drug trafficking, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial aid and restrictions on the granting of visas, would have been of concern to the Central American country with a high percentage of unemployed and killings.
After a series of internal meetings, officials from North America and Central America postponed a high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward in an attempt to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.
But in mid-September the senior management officials made clear that they intended to continue with the conference, thereby definitively renouncing any sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence has been assigned to chair the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, to demonstrate the importance the administration attaches to this meeting, say diplomats.
And the three American envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and Dominican Republic without receiving any further reprehensible or punishment messages from Washington.
A spokesperson from Bolton to the White House refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials and two diplomats who agreed to speak anonymously of the internal decisions.
What they told was confirmed by an outside analyst near the administration who still wanted to keep the anonymity.
Study history
In the report to be published, Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller could accuse Trump of obstruction of justice, which now appears to be sufficient evidence.
According to what is said, Mueller's investigation intends to shed light on Trump's possible collusion with Russia during the presidential campaign.
If the Congress went to the Democrats, Trump should respond to these accusations before the voters and perhaps to a jury of his peers as he prepares for a new candidacy.
The unknown are many and I do not intend to say that Trump's fall is inevitable, as is the case with his counterparts in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic we will have to make choices that will determine how long the fight could last.
In 1938, German officials were ready to organize a coup against Hitler if the Western powers stopped him and supported the Czechoslovakians in Monaco.
On that occasion we failed to allow ourselves to escape the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around these turning points where the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
The Americans at the moment have to deal with different things.
What would happen if Trump decided to fire the deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein's position has been complicated since this newspaper pointed out that last year it has secretly suggested that Trump be intercepted by questioning his ability to fill the role of president.
Rosenstein claims that the news published on The Times is not true.
"How will we react if the new FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh will not be complete or impartial or if it will be confirmed to the Supreme Court despite reliable allegations of attempted rape and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote for a Congress that will ask Trump to respond to his actions?
If we do not overcome these trials, democracy will have to prepare itself for a long winter.
But the lesson I learned in Prague makes me think we're gonna make it.
My mother was a Czech-speaking Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, moved to America and, 60 years later, sent me to turn on the Sabbath candles with swastika.
With such an inheritance, I can only be optimistic about the future."

Graham Dorrans of Rangers is optimistic about meeting with Rapid Vienna
Thursday the Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna knowing that a victory over the Austrians, after the convincing draw against the Villarreal in Spain, would give them excellent opportunities to qualify for the Group G of Europe League.
Although due to an accident on his knees, midfielder Graham Dorrans played his first game of the season on the occasion of the 2-2 draw with the Villarreal, he believes that this result can enable Rangers to do great things.
"For us it was a positive result because Villarreal is a good team," said the player thirty-year-old.
"We faced the game convinced to do well and brought home a point.
Maybe we could have won at the end of the game, but all in all, the draw is a fair result.
They were better in the first time, while in the second we played better.
As far as Thursday is concerned, it will be another great European evening.
We hope to win the three points but it will be a difficult meeting because our opponents have achieved a good result in the last match. However, I am sure that, thanks to the support of the public, we will not be able to disappoint.
Last year was certainly difficult because of my accidents and changes at the club level itself but now the sensations are positive.
The team is in shape, the boys have fun and the preparation goes well.
So we can forget the problems of last season and think about the future."
Women are concerned about the costs of long-term assistance
Although those who participated in the survey have clear ideas about the type of assistance they would like to receive, few have addressed the subject in the family.
About half of the respondents from Nationwide said they had talked to their spouse about the cost of long-term assistance.
Only 10% claims to have talked to their children about it.
According to Holly Snyder, vice president of the nationwide life insurance sector, "people want him to be a member of their family to take care of them, but they don't face this conversation."
That's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: you cannot prepare your family to assist you if you do not communicate for a while what you want.
If you have an advisor, decide with him and your family where and how you want to receive assistance, because these factors can be cost determinants.
Involve a financial advisor: you can recommend how to pay the costs you will have to face.
The choice of long-term assistance funding may include a traditional insurance policy or a hybrid life policy with redeemable value to cover these expenses or continue to pay money for insurance as long as you are able to do so.
Prepare all necessary documents to avoid legal battles at your death.
Appoint a health care prosecutor so that a person you trust can supervise medical care and ensure that professionals meet your wishes in case you were unable to communicate.
Consider also the possibility of a procurator for your finances.
You can choose a trusted person who makes financial decisions for you and make sure that your accounts are paid in case you weren't able to do so.
Don't forget the details: imagine that your old parent is brought urgently to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write this information in detail so that you are always ready.
"It's not just a matter of finance, but who are the doctors?" asks Martin.
"What are the drugs?
Who will take care of the dog?
Prepare for any occurrence."
Man hit multiple times with an air rifle compressed to Ilfracombe
A man was hit several times with a compressed-air rifle while he was walking after spending the night outside.
The victim, a forty-year-old, was in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was hit in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as "casual action".
The victim didn't see his assailant.
He's not in any danger of life, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to official sources, at least 384 people died as a result of a very strong earthquake and a tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday. The victim's budget is destined to rise.
The communications were interrupted and the relief officials were unable to obtain any information from the regency of Donggala, an area north of Palu that is close to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5.
After the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Here are some essential data on Palu and Donggala in the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi and with a population of about 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
When she was hit by the earthquake and tsunami, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala is a regency that extends more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coast in the north-west of the island of Sulawesi.
The regency, an administrative region dependent on a province, had some 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of support for the economy of the Central Sulawesi province and especially of the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel extraction is also an important activity in the province, but it is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit several times by tsunamis in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
Another tsunami struck the western part of Donggala in 1996 killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismic area called the Pacific fire belt and is often affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the strongest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On 26 December a strong earthquake on the western coast of Aceh province north of Sumatra caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries killing, along the coast of the Indian Ocean, 226,000 people, of which more than half of Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra between the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: an earthquake of 6.8 magnitude struck the southern part of Java, the most populous island in Indonesia, causing a tsunami that fell against the southern coast by killing nearly 700 people.
2009: an earthquake of magnitude 7.6 fell near the city of Padang, capital of Western Sumatra Province.
The victims were more than 1,100.
2010: an earthquake of magnitude 7.5 struck one of the Mentawai islands off Sumatra, causing a tsunami of 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: a slight earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh causing destruction and panic in people who remembered the devastation of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
In this case there was no tsunami but more than 100 people died under the rubble.
2018: a strong earthquake struck the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia killing more than 500 people, most of which in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested on the charge of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested with the charge of aggression.
Based on a report issued on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers, Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, he was arrested for suspected domestic violence, for obstructing the complaint and resisting arrest.
According to the report, when a acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he ripped her off his hand phone.
Palin was transferred to the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility centre and his bail was set at $500, as reported by the KTU.
According to the television network, he appeared in court on Saturday and declared himself "certainly innocent".
Palin is at risk of being charged with three first-degree crimes, namely detention for up to one year and a fine of $250,000.
He was also charged with a second-degree offence punishable by a day of detention and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that Palin is accused of criminal acts.
In December 2017 he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
The mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is currently under review by the Alaskan Court of Veteran's Court.
In January 2016 he was accused of domestic aggression, of obstructing the complaint of crime and possession of a weapon while drunk in connection with the accident.
His girlfriend accused him of hitting her with a fist on her face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans in 2016 for linking her child's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress syndrome resulting from the period spent in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after the earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communications network are not working and the victims' budget is intended to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck off Central Sulawesi, located to the northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Social media broadcasts videos showing the time of impact.
When the tsunami fell on the coast, hundreds of people gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu.
Federal prosecutors are calling for extraordinary capital punishment for suspected terrorist attacks against NYC
New York federal prosecutors are calling for capital punishment for Sayfullo Saipov, author of the terrorist attack that caused the death of eight people: a rare penalty that has never been committed for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, is accused of using a Home Depot rental van to dive on a cycling track along the West Side Highway in the Lower Manhattan area by investing pedestrians and cyclists in October.
On the basis of the conditions for the request for capital punishment in the southern district of New York, in order to justify the death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" also inflicted serious bodily injury.
According to the court's document, both of these charges may lead to the death sentence.
Week after the attack, a large federal jury handed over to Saipov 22 counts that included eight counts of murder with association with crime, usually used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, and an indictment of violence and destruction of cars.
The attack called for "a real planning and premeditation," said the prosecutors describing the way Saipov brought it to an end as "atrocious, cruel and depraved".
The preliminary notice states that "Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused damage, offenses and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco".
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
Ten years have passed since the southern district of New York pursued the last case of capital punishment.
The man cited in the trial, Khalid Barnes, was accused of the murder of two drug traffickers but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death sentence was last executed in New York in 1953 for the federal case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, husband and wife accused of conspiracy through espionage and incriminated for passing information to the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Rosenberg's spouses both died in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the documents of the court, Saipov, native to Uzbekistan, showed no sign of repentance in the days and months following the attack.
The police claim that in front of the investigators they were proud of what they did.
According to the accusation, Saipov told the authorities that he had decided to complete the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked the police to hang the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
With regard to the 22 counts, it was found not guilty.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, was "obviously disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to apply for the death penalty rather than accept an acknowledgement of guilt and the condemnation of waste without any possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all the people involved," Patton said.
Saipov's group of defenders had previously begged prosecutors not to ask for the death penalty.
Member of Parliament Tory states that NIGEL FARAGE must conduct the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today swore to "mobilize the popular army" during a protest at the Tory conference.
When one of the members of the parliament of the Theresa May Party suggested that he should deal with negotiations with the European Union, the former leader of the UK Independence Party stated that politicians should "feel pressure" on Eurosceptics.
In March, Conservative MP Peter Bone told Birmingham that the United Kingdom would "be already out of Europe" if Farage was the Secretary for Brexit.
But the challenges that May faces in trying to reconcile the positions of its deeply divided party were emphasized by the Torys in favour of staying in Europe who participated in a separate protest against Brexit in London.
The Prime Minister is trying to apply the Chequers Plan among the attacks of Brexit supporters, those who want to remain in Europe and the European Union.
Allies insist on continuing efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the strong collective reaction, and to force Eurosceptics and Labourists to choose between what May proposes and the "chaos".
At the committee of the Leave Means Leave organisation held in Solihull, Bone said he wanted to abandon the Chequers Plan.
He suggested that the task of conducting negotiations with Brussels should have been entrusted to Farage.
"By this time we would already be out of Europe," he said.
Parliament member Wellingborough added: "I am for Brexit but we must abandon the Chequers Plan".
Explaining the reasons for his opposition to the European Union, he said: "We have not fought world wars to serve them.
We want to be able to apply our laws in our country."
Bone rejected the opinion that public opinion would change from the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their mind and want to stay in Europe is completely false".
Even parliamentarian Tory Andrea Jenkyns, supporter of Brexit, participated in the court and told the journalists: "I simply tell the Prime Minister to listen to people.
The Chequers Plan is not appreciated by public opinion in general, the opposition will not vote for it and does not enjoy the favors of our party and our activists who run the streets for votes to allow us to be elected.
Forget the Chequers Plan and start listening."
In an incisive message for May he added: "The prime ministers can keep their place when they keep their promises."
At the committee, Farage stated that politicians should be able to "feel pressure" if they intend to betray the decision taken with the referendum of 2016.
"Now it is a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them we won't let him."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd he added: "I want you to feel the pressure to our political class that is about to betray Brexit.
We intend to mobilize the popular army of this country that voted for Brexit and we will not stop until we become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, those in favour of staying in Europe marched on the streets of Birmingham before holding a two-hour committee in the city centre.
A small number of activists pushed the Tory against the Brexit flags after the formation of the group this weekend.
The Labourman laughed at the conservatives for the security problems they had with an app of the party at the opening of the conference.
"These are the people who say they can install IT systems and all technology for the Canada plus plus agreement, for the boundless borders and for borderless trade in Ireland," he added.
It's a farce.
A good Brexit doesn't exist," he concluded.
Warren is seriously thinking about applying for the presidency.
Senator USA Elizabeth Warren states that after the November elections she will seriously consider applying for the presidency.
According to the Boston Globe, the Democratic Senator of Massachusetts on Saturday spoke about her future during a town assembly in Western Massachusetts.
Warren, often critical of President Donald Trump, is a candidate for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
The hypothesis that Trump could challenge in 2020 was already in the air for a long time.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke has been its 36th meeting with voters in the form of a city assembly since Trump settled down.
One participant asked her if she wished to apply for the presidency.
Warren replied that it is now that "women go to Washington to fix the government and this implies that a woman is in the highest position."
Arrest for the murder of the player of the LSU Sims
Baton Rouge police in Louisiana reportedly arrested a suspect for the murder of the LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11:00 on ETNews.
On Friday he broadcast a murder video asking for help in identifying a man visible in the sequences.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims reported a gunshot wound to his head that caused his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul said on 247Sports.
Wayde intervened to defend a friend and was hit by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was on the scene of the crime in possession of a weapon and that he had hit Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and detained in a state of detention at the Parish Police Department of East Baton Rouge.
Junior player almost two meters grew up in Baton Rouge, last season Sims played 32 meetings of which 10 were to be held with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after the victory on Sebastian Vettel thanks to the team's orders
When Saturday Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of comrade Lewis Hamilton, it was immediately evident that the orders of the Mercedes team would have severely conditioned the race.
From the pole, Bottas went well leaving Hamilton to defend himself from the attacks of Vettel in the first two laps.
Vettel first stops at the boxes leaving Hamilton in the group's tail traffic, move that could be decisive.
The Mercedes stops the next round on the track behind Vettel. Hamilton however overtakes it after some wheel-to-wheel actions where the Ferrari driver tries to prevent it from moving inside risking ending out after a double shift to defend itself in the third curve.
Max Verstappen leaves from the last row of the grid but at the end of the first round is already seventh on the day of his 21st birthday.
He then guides the race for much of the race without stopping at the tire exchange boxes and tries to finish quickly to overcome Kimi Raikkonen by winning fourth place.
At the end, however, it must perform the pit stop at the 44th turn and in the remaining 8 laps it is not able to increase the step and overcome Raikkonen, which arrives fourth.
"It's a difficult day because Valtteri worked very well throughout the weekend and was really nice to get me through.
The team did an exceptional job to win the first and second positions," Hamilton said.
A bad example of body language
In a committee held on Saturday, President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Diane Feinstein for her insistence on not revealing the contents of Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing the candidate of attempted rape at Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
During a committee in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly of the testimony given by Ford in front of the Senate Judicial Committee, but commented that what is happening in the Senate proves that people are "male, bad and lying".
"What can happen and what is happening in the last days in the Senate where people are angry, mean, bad and lying," he said.
"When there are obvious signs that the news is being disclosed and those responsible say "oh no, it wasn't me.
I could never do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you reveal the news?
Remember his answer... did you reveal the content of the document?
Oh, no.
I didn't."
Wait a minute.
We revealed it... No, we didn't," she added by imitating the senator.
The letter in which Ford accuses Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July and the content was disclosed in early September, but Feinstein denies that the indiscretion is breached by his office.
"I didn't hide the accusations of Professor Ford, but I didn't reveal her story," Feinstein told the committee, as reported by The Hill.
"He asked me to keep the information confidential and I did."
But his lie is not credible for the president, who during the Saturday evening commission commented: "I tell you, this is just a bad example of body language.
Maybe he didn't, but this is the worst example of body language I've ever seen."
By continuing to defend the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was accused of attempted sexual crime by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats are using these charges for their own purposes.
"They are trying to regain power by any means necessary.
You see the messinity, the wickedness. They don't care who harms, who must pass over to regain power and control," said the president as reported by Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against the Dundee
The Dundee Stars recovered after Friday's defeat in the Elite League match against the Belfast Giants winning the return race for 5-3 Saturday in Dundee.
The Giants immediately went to the advantage of two goals on shots by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team to the draw before Dwyer brought the Giants to the advantage.
Francois Bouchard scored the match for the Dundee before two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen decreed their victory.
It was the third defeat of the Elite League season for Adam Keefe's men that on Friday evening in Belfast had rebounded and won the match with the Dundee for 2-1.
The two teams have already met four times this season and the Giants have won the first three matches.
Dwyer scored the first goal at 3:35 p.m. on Kendall McFaull's assist, while Beauvillier doubled after four minutes on David Rutherford's assist.
In what was a fairly lively first time, Sullivan brought the home team back to play at 13:10 p.m. before Matt Marquardt provided the team assistant at Cownie at 15:16 p.m..
Dwyer decreed the advantage for the Giants by marking the second goal of the evening at the end of the first time.
The home team went back and Bouchard won the draw after a strategic maneuver at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran contributed to Nielsen's action that brought the Dundee to the advantage for the first time in the meeting at the end of the second time and decreed the victory of his team by scoring the fifth goal in the middle of the last time.
The Giants, who have lost four of the last five meetings at this point, will play their next home match at Milton Keynes on Friday.
Flight controller dies to allow hundreds of passengers to escape the earthquake
In Indonesia a flight controller will be hailed as a hero after being killed to allow a plane carrying hundreds of people to take off safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are scattered due to a very strong earthquake that struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday causing a tsunami.
Strong shocks of harassment continue to interest the area and many are trapped among the debris in the city of Palu.
But even though his colleagues had fled to save their lives, the twenty-first year Anthonius Gunawan grande remained in his place in the control tower of the airport Mutiaara Sis Al Jufri in Palu, which was fearfully oscillating.
He wanted to make sure that the flight Batik Air 6321, which was on the runway, was able to take off safely.
So he threw himself out of the control tower when he thought he was about to collapse.
He died later at the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesperson Yohannes Siriat said that the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, as reported by Australian broadcaster ABC News.
We have prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"For us it's really sad news," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the number of victims can reach the thousands and the national countermeasures agency for disasters informs that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The count of the dead is destined to increase because many bodies are still under the rubble and it has been impossible to reach many others," explains the spokesman for the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
High waves up to 6 meters have devastated Palu, where a mass burial will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are transporting aid and food.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance transports bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Minimums are looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is doing everything possible to help the survivors, but we don't know what they'll find.
The situation is already tragic, but it could be much worse."
Indonesia's president, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the men of the country's army: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the evacuation activities.
Are you ready?", as reported by the CNN.
During the year Indonesia had already been hit by earthquakes in Lombok, where 550 people were killed.
Aviation disaster in Micronesia: Air Niugini now claims that there is a scatter after the lagoon accident
The airline of the flight that fell into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, after stating that all 47 people on board between passengers and crew members had managed to save themselves, now claims that there is a scatter.
According to the news from Air Niugini, updated on Saturday afternoon, a passenger is missing at the call.
The airline confirmed that it is in contact with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details on the passenger, such as age or nationality.
The local boats allowed the other passengers and crew to escape after the accident while the aircraft was attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
According to official sources, seven people were transported to the hospital on Friday.
The airline claims that six passengers were admitted to the hospital on Saturday and are all in stable condition.
What caused the accident and the exact sequence of events are not yet clear.
The airline and the United States Navy claim that the plane has rushed into the lagoon because it has not reached the runway.
Some witnesses claim that the plane crossed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane reached a very low altitude.
"And it was really lucky," Jaynes said.
Jaynes then explained that he and others, walking in the water that came to life, managed to reach the aircraft's emergency exits.
He added that the flight attendants were panicked and shouted and that he was slightly hit in the head.
According to the U.S. Navy, even some sailors who were working nearby to set up a bridge provided help using a rubber to transport people on the shore before the plane landed in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Aviation Safety Network data indicate that in the last two decades 111 people died in aircraft accidents of the aircraft lines registered with PNG but none of these involved Air Niugini.
Analyst reconstructs the night of the burnt woman alive
Saturday ended the presentation of the evidence of the prosecution in the new trial against a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
Analyst from the Department of Justice of the United States of America Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used the cell phone data to reconstruct the movements of the twenty-ninth charged Quinton Tellis and the victim's 19th Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
As reported by The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett claimed to have recovered the location data from several cell phones demonstrating that, contrary to what he said, Tellis was with the Chambers the night he was killed.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers during the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford showed up in court on Saturday and testified that the day was not in town.
When the public ministry asked him if Tellis was telling the truth saying that that night was in the Sanford truck, he confirmed that he was "lie because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency is the fact that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for two weeks when she died.
The cell data indicates that they had only known each other for one week.
Rowlett explained that after the death of the Chambers, Tellis eliminated from his phone the messages, calls and contact information of the Chambers.
"He erased it from his life," Hale said.
The defence will begin its concluding argument Sunday.
The judge expects the trial to be passed to the jury later on the same day.
The High Breed: What is hip-hop aware?
A three-hop hip-hop wants to challenge the negative vision of this genre by inserting positive messages into their tracks.
The High Breed Group of Bristol argues that hip-hop has moved away from its origins when it spread political messages and denounces social problems.
They want to return to their origins and make again a kind of hip-hop aware.
Artists like the Fugees and Common have recently returned to the UK thanks to characters like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?!
A New York nanny cites a couple in court for firing her with a "racist" text
In New York, a nanny cited a couple in court for having dismissed her discriminatoryly after she had mistakenly received a text in which the mother complained that she was "another black".
The couple refuses to be racist by comparing the request to a real "storsion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed her disappointment when she discovered that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, arrived for her first day of work in 2016, was black.
"Nooooooooooo one more black," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in a message for her husband.
But instead of sending him to her husband, she sent him to Miss Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, after realizing the mistake, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman "prejudiced" fired Miss Maurice saying she was not satisfied with their previous nanny, an African American, and expected a Filipino.
He paid Miss Maurice for her day's work and sent her home with a cab.
Maurice cited the couple in court and, for being fired, asked for compensation for the beauty of $350 a day for the six months of full-time work for which she had initially been hired, although without a contract.
"I want them to understand that they can't behave like this," said Friday at the Post adding "I know it's discrimination."
The couple responded to the accusation of racism by claiming that the dismissal of Maurice was the only thing to be done because they feared they could not trust her after having offended her.
"My wife sent you a message in which she said something she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist people," declared husband Joel Plasco at the Post.
"Would you entrust your children to someone you were rude to, even if by mistake?
Your baby?
I don't think so."
Comparing the request to a real "distortion", Plasco said that the wife has been giving birth for just two months and is in a "very difficult situation".
"You can't get along with a person like that.
It is not a very kind behaviour," the financial consultant added.
While the legal case is still under way, the court of public opinion has immediately denounced the spouses on social media by harshly criticizing them for their behaviour and for the logic followed.
A letter reveals that Paddington's publisher feared that readers would not appreciate a talking bear
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, was born shortly after the book was accepted, comments the letter as follows: "It's not easy to put in the clothes of those who read the book for the first time before it was published.
It's fun now that we know the great success of Paddington."
I affirm that the father, who worked as a cameraman at the BBC before writing the children's book inspired by a toy bear, would not react well to the rejection of his work, adds that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was a little "sad" after his death last year.
About Paddington, which you describe as "a very important member of our family" adds that the father was modestly proud of his success.
"He was quite a calm man, not a presumptuous person," he says.
"But Paddington was so real to him that he acted like when you have a son who reaches a goal: you are proud of it even if it isn't worth yours.
I think he would interpret Paddington's success this way.
Although it was a creation of his imagination, it attributed the merit to Paddington himself."
I had to say goodbye to my daughter's phone that she was dying.
At the landing the daughter was transported urgently to the hospital of Nice Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad called me several times to tell me that the situation was really serious and that our daughter wouldn't have done it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperuse.
"Then she called me to tell me she would be dead in a few minutes and I had to say good-bye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The effect of the medicines that doctors had given her to allow the heart to continue pumping was slowly becoming more confident.
She died a little while earlier and it was the end.
I had to sit down and wait knowing all this was happening.
I couldn't complain, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold on."
In the end, Mrs. Ednan-Laperuse, saddened by the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with other unknown passengers of what was happening to her.
"No one knew," he says.
"All the time I've done nothing but crying low-headedly.
It's hard to explain, but while I was on the plane I felt an incredible sense of solidarity with Nad.
I thought he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much she loved her."
Tickets of two women who are pained to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women whose loved ones have committed suicide commit themselves to preventing others from making the same gesture.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have attacked a bridge in Wales tickets with motivational messages and phone numbers that people can call to receive support.
Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he started to suffer from depression and killed himself at 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel like I feel every day," he says.
Davis, who is 45 years old and lives in Lydney, tells that his son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
"They all knew him for his smile.
They always said he was lighting every room he entered."
But before he died he left the job because depression had brought him "into a really dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, found him after he took his life.
Davis says, "I'm afraid there's a chain effect."
He created the tickets "to let people know that there is someone they can talk to, even if it's a friend.
They don't have to be isolated, they have to talk."
Humphreys, who has been a friend of Davies for years, has lost his 15-year-old partner, Mark, not long after his mother's death.
"You never said you felt down or down," he says.
"A couple days before Christmas we noticed that his attitude had changed.
The Christmas day touched the bottom. When the children opened the gifts, they avoided looking them in the eyes."
He says his death was a huge trauma that they had to develop: "He has torn the family apart.
He broke us up.
But we had to go ahead and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is uncertain: the FBI began investigations
"I think that if we could proceed as requested, that is, with a limited investigation in time and within, we could reach an agreement," said Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee was "losing calm" because of the blockade of root supporters.
Why does Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due to the choice of time.
Only five weeks are left to the mid-term elections on November 6th. If the Republicans as planned will achieve a negative result, they will be strongly weakened in their attempt to elect the man who has chosen for the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush called the senators in pressure to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and thanks to him met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI completes its report?
We will vote in the Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh will be able to obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break the delays and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
The number of political refugees in North Korea "decreases" with Kim
A South Korean legislator states that the number of North Koreans seeking political refuge in South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un rose to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of South Korean unification, states that refugees were 1,127 last year against 2,706 of 2011.
Mr. Park explains that the main reasons are a stricter control of the border between North Korea and China and the highest rates asked by those who illegally bring these people out.
Pyongyang has not issued public statements.
The vast majority of refugees in North Korea are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run through China, whose border with North Korea is longer and easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers them illegal emigrants rather than refugees and often returns them with force.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
This month the two countries have already met in Pyongyang to discuss the negotiations on denuclearisation which are in a standstill situation.
This after the historic June meeting between the President of the United States Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, in which they agreed in general terms to cooperate to free the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, however, the North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho criticized the US sanctions for the lack of developments since then.
"Without trust in the United States, we cannot be certain of our national security, and in these circumstances there is no chance that we will proceed to unilateral disarmament first," said Ri in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelossi defines Brett Kavanaugh as "sterical" and claims that it is not suitable for the Supreme Court
The leader of the Nancy Pelosi minority defines the candidate for the "sterical" Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and says that he is not particularly suitable for this post.
Pelosi expressed this opinion on Saturday in an interview during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I think if a woman had behaved the same way, they would have called it hysterical," Pelosi said about the statement made by Kavanaugh on Thursday before the Senate's judicial committee.
Visiblely excited Kavanaugh denied the accusation of sexually harassing Professor Christine Blasey Ford while they were both teenagers.
At the beginning of his speech, Kavanaugh was in the grip of emotion, so much to get almost to scream and with his throat narrowed by crying while talking about his family and the years at high school.
He also explicitly condemned the Committee's democrats who defined the charges against him as an "inspired and coordinated defamatory campaign" organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelosi believes that Kavanaugh's testimony proves that he cannot enter the Supreme Court because he has shown that he has been warned against democrats.
"I think he has self-exclusion with his statements and the way he spoke about Clinton and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi then objected when she was asked whether she would try to put Kavanaugh on trial in case it was confirmed and whether the Democrats should reach a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I think that if you don't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, it's not only suitable for the Supreme Court, but also for the court that now presides," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a court judge of the Appeals Court for the District Circuit of Columbia.
Pelosi added that, as a democrat, she is concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe vs. Wade, because she is considered a conservative judge.
In the hearing for its confirmation, Kavanaugh circumvented his questions on his intentions to overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
Pelosi stated that "You cannot send a hysterical person and a party to the Supreme Court and demand that this decision be welcomed in a positive manner".
And women must use it.
It's a fair stage, months and years of anger attacks from which he can't get out without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's weird, do you?"
And he continued, "I was very helped by a woman who was a leader somewhere. She told me that she was also crying when she was angry, but she had developed a technique so when she was angry and started crying, she told the person she was talking to. "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And so it went on.
I thought his idea was brilliant."
Tears are tolerated as a burst of anger in part because they are basically not understood.
One of the sharpest memories that I have of a previous job in an office predominantly male goes back to when once I cried for an angry access. An older woman than me, a glacial manager from which I had always been slightly terrified caught me for the collet and dragged me along the stairs.
"Never show you cry," he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and happy because they have you in their arms."
Patricia Schroeder, then a democratic member of the Colorado Congress, collaborated with Gary Hart in his presidential career.
In 1987, when on a boat named Monkey Business was discovered Hart's extramarital relationship that had to give up the race, Schroeder, who was very disappointed, thought that there was no reason why she should not have tried herself to run for the presidency.
"It wasn't really a well-considered decision," he told me about 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates running and there was no need for another one.
Someone called them "Biancaneve and the seven dwarfs."
Since the campaign was already in an advanced stage, Schroeder was late with the fundraiser and swore that she would not apply if she did not raise $2 million.
It was a lost cause from the start.
He discovered that some of the supporters who had given men 1,000 dollars to her would only give 250.
"Do you think I can get a discount?" he asked.
When he gave the speech to announce that he would not launch an official campaign, he was so overwhelmed by the emotions (gratitude for the people who had supported him, disappointment towards the system that made it harder to find money and voters than representatives and anger for the sexual discrimination he was victim), that he moved.
"It seemed like I was in a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalled, thinking about the reaction of the press.
"Someone might have thought that Kleinex was my company sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they would write on my stone.
Maybe "Think a lot."
How the US-China Trade War could favor Beijing
The opening strikes of the US-China trade war have been fragile and, while the battle is far from over, experts say that a contrast between the two countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long run.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, has already launched the first warning this year by taxing major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with new duties on articles for over 200 billion dollars (175 billion euros) of value. This means that taxes will be applied on half of Chinese goods.
Beijing has reacted with measures of the same kind each time by recently applying duties from five to ten percent of US$60 billion.
China has promised to respond to the US hit and it is unlikely that the second largest economic power in the world will soon move back.
For Washington to resign, it would be necessary to give in to his demands, but publicly bending to the USA would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Experts believe, however, that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of trade war with the USA can positively influence China over the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision by Washington or Beijing can create the initial conditions of an economic collapse in both countries is indeed much more dangerous than what has been recognized so far," says Abigail Grace, an Asian researcher at the Research Center for New American Security.
Syria is "ready" for the return of refugees, supports the Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the return of refugees and is looking for help in rebuilding the country devastated by over seven years of war.
In front of the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem stated that the country's conditions are improving.
"Today the situation on the territory is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to recover the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
Now there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that have had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and their livelihood.
According to the United Nations estimate, more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million still living in Syria need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem stated that the Syrian regime will gladly accept assistance to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that he will not accept any aid conditional on conditions or by those countries that supported the insurrection.
Europe wins the victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup by beating the USA team with a final score of 17.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The US has thus lost six consecutive times on European soil and have not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the trophy once the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
The USA Phil Mickelson champion, who fought for most of the tournament, launched his tee shot into the water at the sixteenth hole of Par 3 giving the victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer has distinguished himself in all his tournaments becoming one of the four players who has always recorded a 5-0-0 since the tournament with the current formula was played for the first time in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated by the lower Danish player Thorbjorn Olesen of the European team with a score of 5&4.
The world's best player, Dustin Johnson, surrendered for 2&1 to English Ian Poulter who might have played his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran of the Ryder Cup, the Spanish Sergio Garcia who played eight, became the European player who won the most in the tournament history with 25.5 points.
"I don't usually cry, but I can't help it today.
It was a difficult year.
I'm grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so glad I got the cup back.
It's a team victory and I'm glad I made my contribution," said an excited Garcia after the European victory.
Pass the witness to his fellow John Ram who beat the US Tiger Woods golf legend with the score of 2&1 in Sunday singulars.
"If I think I grew up looking at his meetings, I'm really very proud to have beaten Tiger Woods," said the twenty-first-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now the count of his meetings in the Ryder Cup amounts to 13 wins, 21 defeats and 3 draws.
A strange statistic if you think he's one of the biggest players of all time having won 14 of the main titles, according only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team tried all weekend to find fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
Captain USA Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance of his team: "I'm proud of these guys because they fought.
At some point this morning we put pressure on the European team.
We've thrown this opportunity away.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players behaved very well.
I'll work with the American PGA and the Ryder Cup committee and we'll move on.
I'm fond of these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We got it all together.
But they played better than we did."
