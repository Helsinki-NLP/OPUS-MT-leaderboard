Members of the Welsh Assembly concerned about "identifying them as Muppets"
Several members of the Assembly expressed their dismay at the proposal to amend their title by MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, member of the Welsh Parliament).
This controversy has emerged from the plan to change the Assembly's name to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly of all different political parties have expressed their concern that this measure may become a cause for ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party meeting said that his party was concerned about the fact that MWP "laughed with Twp or Pwp."
For non- Welsh readers: In Welsh, twp means stupid and, pwp, excrement.
A member of the Plaid Cymru party assembly commented that his party as a whole "does not see it with good eyes" and proposed several alternatives.
For his part, a Welsh conservative member claimed that his group was "open" in the face of the change of name, but also commented that there is too small a difference between the term "MWP" and "Muppet."
In this context, it must be said that the letter "w" in Welsh is pronounced similarly to the letter "u" in Yorkshire English.
According to the committee of the assembly responsible for drafting the legal draft to introduce the changes of names: "The final decision on any qualification to appoint members of the assembly will of course fall within its own members."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 grants the Welsh Assembly all the power to change its name.
In June, the committee published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, with extensive support for the proposal to change the name of the assembly by the Welsh Parliament.
With regard to the title of the members of the assembly, although the committee took the view that "Members of the Welsh Parliament" or "WPM", the option of "MWP" was the one that received wider support for the public consultation.
The members of the assembly seem to be suggesting different alternatives, but the attempt to reach a consensus may result in a complete misunderstanding for the President of the Assembly, Elin Jones, who is expected to present the legal draft on the changes in a matter of weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes related to the functioning of the assembly, such as rules on the disqualification of its members and the design of the committee system.
The members of the assembly will hold the final vote on their name during the legislative debate.
Macedonians will vote in referendum on their country's change of name
Citizens will choose Sunday whether or not they want to change their country's name for the Republic of North Macedonia.
The popular consultation was decided in an attempt to resolve a dispute that lasted decades with neighboring Greece, which already has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted on the fact that the name of its northern neighbour represents a way to claim its territory and has repeatedly opposed its attempts to be part of the EU and NATO.
President Macedonian, Gjorge Ivanov, opposed to the plebiscite on the change of name, said he would ignore the vote.
However, those who are in favour, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the change of name is simply the price to be paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's stop ringing: the difficulties of the churches of Harlem
"Historically, the old people I've talked to say there was a bar and a church every corner," says Mr. Adams.
"Today, there is none left, both of them."
According to Adams, the missing bar might be understandable.
"People have another way of socializing today," he comments.
"The bars have already stopped being that kind of living rooms for the neighborhood where people went periodically."
As far as the churches are concerned, he is concerned that the money obtained from the sale of assets does not last as long as their leaders "and that sooner or later they return to the place where they came from."
The churches, he adds, could end up being replaced by apartment buildings and condos with the kind of people who won't be of any help to temples remaining in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who own condominiums in these buildings will be of white race," he says, "and so what they will do is speed up the closure of all churches, as it is quite unlikely that most people moving to these condominiums will end up being members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis; the Metropolitan Community church in 1870 and St. Martin's ten years later.
The white Methodist Congregation, originally formed in the 1930 ’ s, was formed in the mid - 1930 ’ s.
A nearby black congregation acquired the property of the building.
St. Martin's passed by a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who directed a boycott to retail merchants on 125th Street, one of Harlem's main shopping streets, who resisted hiring or promoting black people.
In 1939, a fire caused serious damage to the building, and when Reverend Johnson's parishioners planned to rebuild it, it was then when they ran the rail.
Reverend David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor to St. Martin's church, described the alley as "the bells of the poor people."
The expert who made the alley ring in July described it differently: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also observed that it was the world's first reel that was touched by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who had to move to the largest alley in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What happened in St. Martin's over the past few months, on the other hand, has been the complicated stories of architects and contractors, some of them brought by lay leaders of the church and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The council, the governing body of the parish, made up of secular leaders, wrote to the diocese last July expressing its concern that the diocese "wanted to transmit costs" to the council, although the latter was not involved in the contracting of the architects and contractors that the diocese sent.
Some parishioners have complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A shark hurts a 13-year-old boy while looking for lobsters in California
A shark attacked and injured on Saturday a 13-year-old boy while he was diving to search for lobsters in California on the first day of the lobster season, according to the authorities.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
According to Chad Hammel on the San Diego KSWB-TV, he had been diving with friends on Saturday morning when he heard the screams of a boy asking for help, so they rowed with a group to the place where the boy was sitting to help him get out of the water.
Hammel says that he first thought it was the joy of having caught a lobster, but then "he realized that he was shouting 'I've been bitten!
They bit me!'
He had the whole clavicle torn," observed Hammel when he got to the boy.
"Because everyone comes out of the water, I cried out, 'There's a shark in the water!'," Hammel adds.
The boy was airborne to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was taken seriously.
You don't know what kind of shark is responsible for the attack.
In a press conference, rescuer Larry Giles commented that I work for a few weeks that a shark had been detected in the area, but that it was decided that this species was not dangerous.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper part of the torso.
The authorities closed for 48 hours access to the beaches from Ponto Beach to Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for investigation and security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
The plans of Sainsbury's, towards the UK beauty product market
Sainsbury's decided to compete in Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty product corridors like large warehouses occupied with specialized employees.
These large corridors are just part of a considerable investment in the beauty products market in the United Kingdom, a market that moves about GBP 28 billion and continues to grow while the fashion and home products sectors remain behind, and will try at 11 stores across the country to expand to more shops next year if the test becomes a success.
Investment in beauty products is the product of the greed of supermarkets to take advantage of space in their shelves that used to be destined for televisions, microwaves and home products.
Sainsbury's claims it will double its offer of beauty to offer up to 3,000 different products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also receive more space with areas of brands similar to those that can be found in stores like Boots.
The supermarket company is also in the process of relaunching its range of Boutique makeup products so that most of the products are now suitable for vegans, an increasingly demanding aspect for younger consumers.
The retail chain The Fragrance Shop will also open concessions to two stores in Sainsbury's last week in Croydon, south of London, while the second will open up to Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Internet shopping and switching to a habit of buying food in smaller quantities each day at small supermarkets has made large supermarkets have to find other ways to convince people to come.
According to Mike Coupe, executive director of Sainsbury's, shops will increasingly resemble large stores in an attempt by the supermarket chain to fight against Aldi and Lidl discount supermarkets with more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's been introducing Argos sales points to many of its supermarkets, in addition to a number of Habitat stores since he acquired both chains two years ago, which, he comments, has been used to relaunch grocery stores and increase the profitability of acquisitions.
The previous attempt by the supermarket chain to relaunch its beauty and pharmacy product departments resulted in a failure.
Sainsbury's run a joint operation test with Boots in the early 2000s, but it all ended up rushing to disagree on how to divide the benefits of the chain of pharmaceuticals into the supermarkets.
This new strategy comes after the sale three years ago by Sainsbury's from his 281 pharmaceutical business in Celesio, owner of the LloydsPharmacy chain, for 125 million GBP.
According to Sainsbury's, Lloyds will play an important role in the global plan, as it will expand the range of luxury leather brands, such as La Roche-Posay or Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director of Sainsbury's, comments: "We have transformed the appearance of our beauty product corridors to improve the environment in front of our customers.
We've invested in specifically trained workers who will be of great help in offering advice.
Our brand range is designed to adapt to any need; on the other hand, the attractive environment and practical location make us now one of the preferred destinations for beauty products and challenge the traditional way of shopping."
Peter Jones "hot" after Holly Willoughby retreated from a GBP 11 million deal
Dragons' star Den Peter Jones went "hot" after Holly Willoughby's TV host got behind a GBP 11 million deal with Jones' lifestyle business to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time to engage in the joint business of home products and Truly accessories.
The business of these two media figures had been compared to Gwyneth Paltow's Goop brand.
This morning's 37-year-old presenter used Instagram to announce her departure.
Holly Willoughby has left the star of Dragons' Den Peter Jones furiously withdrawing in the last minute of the lucrative business together lifestyle brand to focus on his own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV, which will also bring him great benefits.
According to various sources, Jones was "hot" when the red star on television admitted, during a tense meeting held on Tuesday at his central empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that the new arrangements of the presenter, worth GBP 1.5 million, implied that he would no longer have enough time to devote to the joint brand of home products and Truly accessories.
The business had come to compare itself with Gwyneth Paltow's Goop brand and aspired to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at 11 million GBP.
When Willoughby, aged 37, used Instagram to announce his Truly departure, Jones took a private plane toward one of his vacation residences outside the United Kingdom.
According to one source, "Truly was by far Holly's top priority.
He was destined to be his long - term future and will be seen for the next 20 or 30 years.
His decision to go back left all the parts involved speechless.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, we were so close to the launch...
Right now there is a warehouse full of goods in its Marlow plant ready to be sold."
According to experts, the march of this Morning's host, one of the most profitable stars in the United Kingdom, could cost millions to the company due to the significant investment that had been made in products, from pillows and candles to clothes and household clothes, and the possibility of delays in their launch.
Besides, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin had maintained an intimate relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly together with Capp in 2016, and Jones, aged 52, joined the president's office last March.
Both couples spend their holidays together, and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin's TV producer.
Willoughby will be the next M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of the I'm A Celebrity ITV program.
A source near Jones commented last night that "We won't comment on their business."
Hard accusations... "and then we fell in love"
He joked about possible criticism from the media to make a comment that some would consider to be "little owned by a president" and to have such a positive opinion of the North Korean leader.
Why did Trump give up so much?
Trump asserted, mocking the tone of a news presenter:
"I have not given up anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in holding a second meeting after the first held in Singapore in June was declared a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations towards denuclearization are stagnant.
More than three months after the summit held in Singapore in June, the South Korean high diplomat Ri Yong commented on Saturday to the leaders of the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea does not see a "response in correspondence" by the United States on the first disarmament initiatives undertaken by its country.
However, he noted, the United States continues to apply sanctions with a view to maintaining pressure.
Trump's point of view, however, was much more optimistic in his speech.
"We're doing very well with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to declare war in North Korea.
Millions of people would have lost their lives.
And now we're maintaining this great relationship."
According to Trump, his efforts to improve relations with Kim have had positive results: ending missile trials, helping to free hostages and returning home to the remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his unusual approach to talking about relations with Kim.
"It's very easy to be Presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this compound full of people, we'd have about 200," said Trump, pointing out the crowd in front of him.
An island destroyed and hundreds of deaths due to a tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, non-governmental organizations in other countries were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of the Lombok population had to be displaced, there was no declaration of any kind of national disaster, previously required to catalyze international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they do not ask for international assistance, so the situation is quite demanding," says Mrs. Subong.
While Save the Children is organizing a team to go to Palu, it's not safe even if foreign people can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesperson for the National Disaster Agency, commented that the Indonesian authorities were evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international agencies are allowed to contribute to providing aid.
Given the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, the country remains unfortunately unprepared for the anger of nature.
Although Aceh has built tsunami shelters, they're not frequent at other costs.
The apparent lack of alert sirens in Palu in the event of a tsunami, even if there was a warning in force, is very likely to have contributed to the number of deaths.
Moving between the huge amount of Indonesia's islands is, at best, a challenge.
And natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship that was docked in Lombok to take care of the victims of the earthquake is now heading to Palu; however, it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo had as the central element of his electoral campaign the improvement of Indonesia's poor infrastructure, and has invested enormous amounts of money in roads and railways.
However, Joko's government is facing next year's re-election of funding deficits.
Joko also faces the pressure of the country's permanent sectarian tensions, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a faith of more conservative caire.
More than 1,000 deaths and tens of thousands of displaced persons are the result of street fights between Christian and Muslim gangs with maths, bows and arrows, and other bloody weapons.
Watch: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool makes the goal of the play with a far shot in front of Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat at the Premier League in front of Chelsea with his goal marked at the minute 89 Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 metres from Chelsea's port when his team was losing 1 to 0.
He accommodated the ball to the left before letting go of an incredible shot directed at the second pole.
The shot crossed the whole area with a great elevation as it propelled itself towards the right cross of the gate.
The ball finally started the descent over a full jump Kepa Arrizabalaga to try to stop it and ended up at the bottom of the network.
"I was only trying to get to that position to be able to shoot, and players like Shaqiri always play it forward as much as possible, so I tried to create myself as long as possible," Sturridge says at LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw that Kanté was coming, I made a knock, and I didn't think much about it, I just threw myself out."
Chelsea won 1 to 0 on the break after scoring a goal in the minute 25 through its Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In the play, the lead of the Blue team returned from heels to Mateo Kovacic before towing from almost half the field and spewing to the Liverpool field.
Kovacic made a quick combination from midfield.
Then he made a magnificent passage in depth, which left Hazard inside the area with the ball under control.
Hazard overcame his defense to finish the second pole with a jute with his left leg where the porter of the Liverpool Alisson Becker could not reach.
Liverpool will face Naples at the Champions League group stage next Wednesday at 3:00 p.m. in Stadium San Paolo de Naples, Italy.
Chelsea, for its part, will play Videoton at UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
The number of deaths for the Indonesian tsunami reaches 832
The number of deaths as a result of the earthquake and tsunami has increased to 832, according to data from the country's disaster agency reported on Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped in the ruins of the collapsed buildings due to the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that took place on Friday and caused waves of up to 6 meters, according to the spokesman for the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho agency in a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has over 380,000 inhabitants, was surrounded by devastated buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man as a murder suspect after finding a stabbed woman
The murder investigation was initiated after the woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with several stab wounds on Grayson Mews, John Street; then a 32-year-old man was arrested as a murder suspect.
The police have asked the residents of the area to see or hear something about the crime they are facing in front of the authorities.
According to Inspector Brian O'Hagan's statement, "If the investigation is still in a preliminary phase, I'd like to call everyone near John Street in Birkenhead and have seen or heard anything suspicious, please contact us.
I would also like to call anyone, especially taxi drivers who have been able to capture anything through the car's boarding camera, to contact them, as they may have vital information for the investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman they found was Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman have come to the crime scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
As the investigation continues, the police have commented that they are reporting the facts to relatives closest to the victim.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police told him no one allowed him in or out of the building.
When she learned what had happened, she was speechless.
Residents are being warned to spend hours until they can get back in.
It felt like a police officer told a man that the whole area was treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared on the scene crying.
He keeps repeating, "That's terrible!"
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were inside the area agreed to by another truck parked outside.
A number of Roman agents inside the agreed area controlling the apartment block.
Anyone who can have information that sends a message directly to @MerPolCC is asked to call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously via 0800 555 111 and mention the 247 dated 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell of the British Parliament becomes the last monument affected by the discussion around "rewriting history"
Their disappearance would be a kind of poetic justice for the purest-style destruction of the Taliban of so many cultural and religious objects in England perpetrated by their fanatic Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society has described Crick's proposal as a "crazy" and an "intense to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, comments: "In the current debate around the withdrawal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's figure in front of the Palace of Westminster would become one of the main objectives.
The iconoclasty of English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps he would end up sacrificing the wrong Cromwell for the actions of his ancestor he did during the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a testament to the views of the 19th century and part of the historiography of a figure that many still believe is worthy of commemoration.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more late in the 19th century than not now, as a parliamentary defender in the face of external pressure, in his obvious case of the monarchy.
Whether or not this is a completely accurate representation remains a matter of historical debate.
What is true is that the media conflict of the 17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure that represents a side of this division.
Their achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration."
A killer pig hurts a Chinese farmer dead.
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local sources.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan", was found dead with a cut artery and covered in blood near a pork court in the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, reported on Sunday the South China Morning Post.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer was preparing to inject pigs' vaccines into a tent in Xining, Qinghai province, China.
It is known that he had traveled with his cousin on Wednesday from the neighbouring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door that led to a court of contiguous pigs.
He claimed that in court there was a large male pig with blood in his mouth.
The forensic exam confirmed that the 250-pound tank had killed the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin had his legs torn apart and filled with blood," said the cousin, surnamed "Wu," as mentioned in the news of Guiyang's evening.
The scenes recorded by the security camera show how Yuan entered the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday morning to feed the pigs.
Her body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was neither owned by Yuan nor by his cousin.
One of the market officials commented on the news of the evening that the pig remained locked and isolated in order to prevent him from attacking anyone else while the police gathered the evidence at the scene of the crime.
According to reports, Yuan family and market officials are negotiating compensation for their death.
Although not very frequent, cases of pigs attacking humans have previously been recorded.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on his farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a pig nearly 300 kg took a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife could scare the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon was devoured by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told the CBC that pigs are usually not aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as "distinguishing."
"They like to play.
They're like children, they're very curious... they don't have the idea of hurting.
Just give them the respect they deserve," he remarked.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring torrential rains to all southwest of the United States
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as she moves on the coldest waters on the north coast of Mexico.
However, the Rosa will bring torrential rains all over northern Mexico and southwest of the United States for the next few days.
The Rosa had 138 km/h winds, owned by a category 1 hurricane at 5:00 a.m. on Sunday, Eastern US time, and located at 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to displace northward on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression is beginning to develop in the Pacific Ocean, which is moving eastward to the west coast of the United States.
The Rosa will leave on Monday up to 250 mm of rain in some parts of Mexico.
Then tropical humidity will interact with the depression that is approaching to generate generalized torrential rains across the southwest during the next few days.
At various points, the 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous streams, waste streams and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
Strong tropical humidity will cause precipitation rates close to 50 to 75 mm per hour at various points, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
They expect from 50 to 100 mm of rain to parts of the southwest, especially in much of Arizona.
There is the possibility that they will laugh, as the situation is getting worse very quickly because of the scattered nature of tropical rains.
It is highly recommended to enter the desert on foot in the face of the threat of tropical rain.
The torrential rains could cause the gorges to become uncontrollable rivers, and storms could bring gusts of wind and dust to specific points.
The depression approaching will bring torrential rains at determined points on the southern coast of California.
Total precipitation over 50 mm may be recorded, which could lead to minor waste flows and slippery paths.
It would be the first rainfall of the rainy season in the region.
Tropical rain-stricken jackals will begin to arrive in Arizona between Sunday and Monday night, before the rain becomes more widespread between Monday and Tuesday night.
The torrential rains will spread to the region of the Four Corners on Tuesday and will persist all Wednesday.
In October, there will be several major fluctuations of temperature across the United States as the Arctic cools, although the tropics will remain quite warm.
This phenomenon can sometimes cause drastic changes in temperature within a short time.
The central region of the United States on Sunday is a clear example of drastic temperature differences.
Temperature differences of almost 20 degrees have been recorded between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the persistent summer heat will try to expand again.
It is expected that the month of October will begin with heat in much of the central and eastern part of the United States, with temperatures around 27 degrees from the South Plane area to parts of the northeast.
The city of New York could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, representing about 10 degrees above the average.
According to the long-term forecast, there are many possibilities for temperatures above the average in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million spectators saw Brett Kavanaugh's statement
More than 20 million spectators saw on Thursday the passionate witness of the candidate for membership of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual abuse, which allegedly took place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, the witness broadcasted to six different television channels.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued, with the transmitters interrupting the usual Friday programming due to a turn of events in the last minute: an agreement designed by Senator Arizona Jeff Flake to conduct an investigation of charges for a week.
Ford explained to the Senate committee on judicial matters that she was absolutely convinced that Kavanaugh touched her drunk and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an exalted witness, affirmed that he was absolutely convinced that this never happened.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million viewers are likely to have seen this witness on Friday.
The company counted the average viewers of the CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC chains.
Hearing numbers were not available immediately by other channels that broadcast the witness, such as PBS, C-SPAN or Fox Business Network.
Plus, Nielsen usually has problems calculating the people who see it from his office.
In perspective, this is a similar audience to that of an American football game or that of the Oscar ceremony.
Fox News Channel, the opinion leaders that have clearly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was the most popular chain, with an average of 5.69 million spectators during the entire day's testimony, according to Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS got 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen data.
Interest stays high after the witness.
Flake was the central figure of Friday's drama.
After the moderate republican office issued a statement saying they would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, Flake was captured by the CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning while he was incarcerated by protesters when he was trying to get on an elevator to go to a hearing of the Judicial Affairs Committee.
Flake was left with a faint view for several minutes while she was on television at CNN.
"Here I am, in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth in the country?
They told him 'you have power, while there are so many women who don't have it!'
Flake said his office had issued a statement and, before the elevator doors were closed, he commented that he would have more to say in front of the committee.
In a few hours, all cable and broadcast channels were already broadcasting live when the Judicial Affairs Committee had to vote whether or not it followed Kavanaugh's appointment to the Senate plenary to vote on it.
Flake said, on the other hand, that he would only understand that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the face-to-face nomination next week, condition demanded by the minority of Democrats.
Flake was convinced in part because of the conversations she had with her friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a subsequent discussion with Coons and several senators, Flake made his decision.
The option chosen by Flake was influential, as it was clear that Republicans would not have enough votes to support Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has initiated an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing politics" in relation to Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of his plans to abandon the European Union to "play politics" with the future of the United Kingdom and to despise national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Congress in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with May on the cover of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister of May Boris Johnson reinforced his attack on the so-called Brexit Chequers Plan, where he says that the proposal that the United Kingdom and the EU collect taxes together is "absurdly".

A Scorpion volcano in Mexico City
The spawned ash by the volcano Popocatepetl has arrived in the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexicans on Saturday that they would stay away from the volcano after activity was detected at the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.

Geophysicists have detected an increase in the activity of the volcano located 72 km south-east of the capital since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has remained active since 1994.
Police face Catalan separatists shortly before the referendum anniversary on independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona last Saturday after protesters in favor of independence confronted with riot police and thousands of people joined opposite demonstrations to remember the first anniversary of the vote that took place in Catalonia on their secession.
A group of independents detained by the riot police began to throw eggs and powder painting, causing dark dust clouds to appear in the streets that were normally invaded by tourists.
Later that same day, riots took place with the police, who used their duties to contain violent protesters.
For several hours, independent groups sang "We don't forget, we don't forgive" face-to-face with unionists calling out "Long live in Spain."
Fourteen people had to be treated for slight injuries sustained during protests, according to local sources.
Tensions did not decrease in this region of independent mentality one year after a referendum considered illegal by Madrid was held on October 1 but also carried out by Catalan separatists.
The voters chose independence by a very large majority, although the participation index was low, since the opposites to the secession boycotted the majority vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote by entering the electoral colleges throughout the region, which led to violent clashes.
The independent groups camped all night on Friday to avoid a demonstration of support for the national police.
The demonstration also took place, but protesters were forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician and one of the participants in the independent protest along with his wife, said he had no more hope about Catalonia's chances of independence.
"Last year we lived one of the best moments.
I saw my parents cry with joy about voting, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite achieving a vital victory, although at little margin, in the autonomic elections last December, the Catalan independent parties have suffered to maintain the momentum this year, since many of their main leaders are in self-imposed exile or detained pending trial for their role in the referendum organization and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, recorded the demonstration of support for the police with his phone, and claimed that the conflict was revived by politicians on both sides.
"The tension only increases," he comments.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the new Catalan leaders imprisoned before the trial since the end of last year, announced that he would participate in the elections to the European Parliament next year.
"Presenting yourself as a candidate for European elections is the best way to denounce the retreat in democratic values and the repression we have seen by the Spanish government," he says.
Londonderry: Men arrested after investing a house with a car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car repeatedly invested against a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 local time.
Inspector Bob Blemmings says they caused damage to the gates and the same building.
It's also possible, at some point, someone fired a bullet against the car.
A Menga move wins Livingston for 1 to 0 in front of Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal with Livingston won
The Livingston, who had climbed into the category this year, surprised the Glasgow Rangers in which it is just the second defeat of Steven Gerard in 18 matches as a coach at the club in the Ibrox neighborhood.
Dolly Menga's move made a difference, as with this victory, Gary Holt's team goes up to the second position, which they share with Hibernian.
Gerrard's, on the other hand, continue without winning at Premiership this season, and next Sunday they're going to face the leader, the Hearts, with whom they're separated by an eight-point difference.
But before that, Rangers get the Vienna Rapid in Europe League on Thursday.
Livingston, in the meantime, widens to six parties his invinctive coat to the league, with a Holt as a coach who still doesn't know what defeat is since Kenny Mile replaced last month.
Livingston doesn't take advantage of his chances in front of visitors' direct game
Holt's team should have gone ahead of the marker long before the goal, since its direct game caused all sorts of problems to Rangers.
Scott Robinson opened his way between the defense, but wasted his chance when he found himself in front of the door, and then Alan Lithgow sent the ball out on his way to try to finish Craig Halkett's past head, who crossed the door.
The locals were right to let Rangers get close to their area, as they knew they could put visitors in trouble in isolated play.
And that's how this decisive goal came to be.
The referee whistled a breach of Rangers' interests and Livingston made an opening to the band, where Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined so Menga could touch it first and finish from the central part of the area.
Until then, the Rangers had dominated possession, but he encountered an impenetrable defense and a doorman Liam Kelly who had very little work throughout the party,
The stage was repeated in the second part, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to perform a merit stop.
For his part, Rangers Allan McGregor stopped with his feet an occasion by Scott Pittman and Lithgow ended up diverting another combination game from Livingston.
The Rangers spent time hanging another ball in the Livingston area, just to be rejected, and two criminals were claimed, one for a supposed Halkett ticket to the Glenn Middleton replacement, and the other for hand.
Livingston "phenomenal": analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and great success for Livingston.
One man believes that they were excellent, and they continue to overcome all expectations in this ascending path.
His style of play and staff have hardly changed since his return to the highest category, although much of the merit must be attributed to Holt for the way the team has galvanized since his arrival.
There was a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was immense in the head of a perfectly organized defense, while Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall had to be looking after Menga throughout the game.
Rangers missed inspiration, though.
Despite the brilliant moments exhibited with Gerard as a coach, they definitely couldn't keep the level.
They didn't know how to create occasions (only once they clearly went beyond the local defense), and that's what Rangers, who's in the middle of the table, should take it as a warning.
Greedy reception for Erdogan in Cologne
All were smiles and clear skies on Saturday (September 29th) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany gathered for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the first day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which was aimed at repairing relations between the two NATO allies.
These had deteriorated due to issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's EU income.
Erdogan then moved to Cologne to inaugurate a new giant mosque.
And it's just that this city has the largest Turkish population in the world outside Turkey.
Police alleged security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from congregating in front of the mosque, although a large number of followers gathered around to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of them Kurds, also felt as they condemned Erdogan's policies as well as the German government's decision to welcome the country.
Both demonstrations reflect the division of views around the visitor, considered a hero by some German Turks and called dictator by others.
Deptford Traffic Accident: A cyclist dies meeting a car
A cyclist killed me as a result of a collision with a car in London.
The accident took place near the Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street Street, a heavy traffic area in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 local time.
The vehicle driver stopped and although the paramedic services took care of the cyclist, he died in the car.
The accident occurs months after another cyclist dies in a runaway crash on Childers Street, 1.6 km from the site of the Saturday accident.
The metropolitan police said their agents are working to identify the man and report the facts to the closest family members.
The street has been cut off and deviations have been applied to the bus routes, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six wounded agents in an altercation
Six prison officers have been injured in an altercation in this prison of high-security men, according to the office of the centre.
The events took place in Long Lartin Prison, Worcestershire, about 9:30 a.m. on Sunday, local time, and still lasts.
Specialized "turned" agents moved to the scene to put an end to the altercation, in which eight prisoners were involved.
Agents had to be held for slight injuries in the face at the scene.
According to a prison service spokesman, "We have deployed prison personnel specially trained to try to solve an incident produced in Long Martin prison, which still continues.
Six employees had to be treated with injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons; we are clear that those responsible for this altercation will have to report to the police and may have to spend even more time in the garrison."
There are more than 500 prisoners at Long Lartin Prison, including some of the most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was announced that the prison chief had to be held in a hospital after being attacked by a prison guard.
In addition, last October, the riot agents took note of presence in prison to resolve a serious altercation in which the staff of the centre were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with important rivers (dry areas may benefit)
It's not usual for a tropical depression to affect Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen early next week when what's left of Hurricane Rosa passes through the southwest desert, with the consequent risk of laughter.
The national weather service has already set up river alerts for Mondays and Tuesdays west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, south-east of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to reach Phoenix on Tuesday and approach it on Monday night with rain.
Phoenix's national weather service commented on a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclists have maintained the state of storm or tropical depression within 322 km of Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) remained 64 km from the Arizona border."
The most recent models of the national hurricane centre have 50 to 100 mm rain, with isolated points where they would register up to 150 mm in the Arizona Mogollon.
Other areas of the southwest desert, including the Central Rockets and the Great Conca, could record 25 to 50 mm, with the possibility of isolated points up to 100 mm.
For areas where laughter is at stake, the rain of the Rose may become quite good news, since the region suffers from a severe drought.
Although laughter is a serious cause of concern, some of the rainfall may be very beneficial, as the southwest region is currently suffering a drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Control Service, more than 40% of Arizona's state suffers at least from extreme drought, the second highest category, reports weather.com.
But first, Hurricane Rosa will land on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
The Rosa continued to have hurricane strength on Sunday morning, with a maximum wind of 137 km/h, and is now 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, heading north at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm is encountering colder waters in the Pacific, which makes it lose strength.
So it's expected that you'll touch the land in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or the evening of Monday.
Precipitation in different parts of Mexico could be strong, with a considerable risk of laughter.
According toweather.com, "they expect 75 to 150 mm of rain from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with the possibility of reaching up to 250 mm".
After that, the Rosa will head north across Mexico with a tropical storm force, before reaching the Arizona border at the first hour of Tuesday with a tropical depression force, finally crossing the state of Arizona and arriving in southern Utah well into Tuesday night.
"The biggest risk we expect from the Rosa or what's left of it is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the southwest desert of the United States," according to the national hurricane center.
Rain is expected to result in dangerous streams and waste streams in deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempting Murder · Global Voices
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested under suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, about 4:00 p.m. on Saturday, local time.
He was moved to the hospital, where he is "stable."
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested the next day in the Radstock area, according to Avon and Somerset police.
Agents have made a call for anyone who can have some sort of recording of the facts with the mobile phone to get in touch.
Trump says Kavanaugh "has suffered the petty and angry" of the Democratic Party
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is the rejection vote for the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party," declared Trump in an election act in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has "suffered the petty anger" of the Democratic party throughout his appointment process.
Kavanaugh declared in front of Congress Thursday, resolutely and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's accusation of having sexually abused her decades ago, when both of them were teenagers.
Ford also testified in court regarding his allegation.
The president said on Saturday that the American people saw Kavanaugh's genius, human quality and courage.
"The vote to ratify Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to ratify one of the brightest minds in the legal world of our time, a lawyer with an admirable trajectory of service to citizenship," he commented to the crowd of supporters of West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's appointment as he spoke of the importance of the Republican voter participation index in the elections of half the term.
"We're five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I don't run, but actually I do," he said.
"That's why I go everywhere fighting for our great candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats are dedicated to "resisting and obstructing."
It is expected that the first key procedural vote to be held in the Senate on Kavanaugh's appointment will take place as late as Friday, according to CNN's briefing by an assistant leader of the Republican party.
Hundreds of earthquake and tsunami deaths in Indonesia, where the number of victims continues to grow
At least 384 people have died, and many have been dragged by the giant waves that hit the shores because of a severe earthquake and tsunami that has affected the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, said the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Friday for a festival held on the beach in the city of Palu when waves of up to six meters impacted the coast towards dusk, dragging many people to death and destroying everything they found on their way.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat arrived yesterday, people were still carrying out their activities on the beach and they didn't run right away, so they became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spoke of the BNPB disaster mitigation agency in a communication to Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, dragged cars, logs, houses, destroyed everything on the ground," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had moved by open sea at speeds of 800 km/h before impacting on the coast.
There are people who climbed up a tree running from the tsunami and were able to survive, he says.
Some 16,700 people had to be evacuated to 24 different centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the disaster mitigation agency that appreciate the amount of shops and destroyed buildings, turned and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Replica continued to shake this coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's intense earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
According to the agency, the geographic characteristics of the city, located at the end of a long narrow bay, could have exponentially increased the magnitude of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "considerable" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, malls, and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims, he says, were found trapped in the ruins of the collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were displaced.
According to Nugroho, the dead and the damage could increase on the coast about 300 km north of Palu, an area called Donggala, closest to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications "were completely paralyzed and therefore no information came," says Nugroho.
There live more than 300,000 people," commented the Red Cross in a statement, adding that its workers and volunteers were heading towards the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, which unfortunately could end up much worse," she says.
The agency was strongly criticized on Saturday for not reporting the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, although agents said the waves arrived during the time the warning was issued.
In a recording of a social media fan, you can feel like a man on the top floor of a building gives desperate shouts of warning to street people about the tsunami approaching.
In minutes, a water wall bursts by the sea, carrying buildings and vehicles.
Reuters couldn't immediately authenticate the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami have resulted in a widespread cut in electricity supply that has interrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue tasks.
Although the army has begun to send humanitarian aid to cargo aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, according to authorities, evacuees continue to need food desperately, as well as other basic needs.
The city airport has been reopened for relief work only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths from the Indonesian tsunami is above 800.
The situation is very serious.
Although World Vision workers in Donggala were able to arrive safely and safely in the city of Palu, where employees sheltered in canvas shelters installed in their office yard, during the course they had to witness scenes of total destruction, Doseba says.
“They told me they saw many destroyed houses,” he said.
It's a catastrophe.
Although relief groups made the devastating gesture of initiating relief efforts, some people complained that humanitarian workers were being prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, fundraising, supplies and foreign personnel can only begin to flow if the place where a disaster has occurred is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a provincial disaster," said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Red Cross Indonesia.
"Once the government says "well, it's a national disaster," we can start calling for international assistance, but this level has not yet been declared."
While staying the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami that occurred on Friday, friends and family members of missing persons maintained the hope that the miracle would take place and their loved ones praised the devastating story of natural disasters.
Saturday, a child was rescued in a sewerage.
Sunday, rescue teams released a woman who had been buried under the rubble for two days with her mother’s body next door.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian National Paragliding Team, had trained two of the paragliders missing for the Asian Games, which ended early this month in Indonesia.
Besides Mr. Mandagi, among the people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, there were his students.
"As a senior in the scope of the umbrella, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon explained that, in the hours following the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel among the paragliding community, he had desperately sent messages for whatsApp to the competitors of Palu who were participating in the beach festival.
However, the messages appeared with a gray check mark instead of a double blue mark.
“I think that means that the messages were not received,” he added.

Kanye West: Raper renames Ye
Raper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
On Saturday, as he announced the change on Twitter, he wrote: "The being formally known as Kanye West."
For some time in West, 41 years old, he was moped with the nickname Ye, and he used this alias as the title of his eighth album, which was published in June.
The change occurs before it appears in the Saturday Night Live program, in which it is expected to present its new album, entitled Yandhi.
Raper replaces singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled his participation for "emotional reasons," according to the author of the program.
Apart from being an abbreviation for his current artistic name, West had previously commented that the word has religious significance for him.
"I think it's the most commonly used word in the Bible, and the Bible means you," said West earlier this year, while talking about the title of his album with the Big Boy radio host.
"So it's you, it's us.
I've passed from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye, which is a reflection of our good part, our bad part, our confused part, everything.
The album is more a reflection than we are."
West is part of a series of famous rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs has been known by various names, such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, former West collaborator, has taken advantage of his nickname with or without a script and capital letters.
Mexico's president, AMLO, promises not to use military force against civilians
Mexico's elected president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has promised never to use military force against civilians, when little is left for the country to fulfill its 50th anniversary of a cruel reprisal against students.
López Obrador promised Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that “the military force would never be used again to suppress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, the army opened fire during a peaceful demonstration and caused the death of 300 people at a time when student student left movements were rooted around Latin America.
López Obrador, who has pledged to support young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities,
he said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities make young people feel attracted to criminal gangs.
U.S. Should Duplicate AI Funds
"While China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount of money they spend on research in this field," says Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and a specialist in artificial intelligence who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments arrive after several members of the U.S. government have announced measures in the field of AI, although there is a general lack of formal strategy in AI.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become the world's number 1 for AI innovation in 2030.
"Dualizing the research budget for AI would be a good start, since the rest of the countries are far behind the US and we want to be pioneers of the next advance in the AI field," Lee said.
"Duplicating funding could double the opportunities that the US will have for the next major AI discovery," Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, author of the book entitled AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the general director of the company Innovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of China's leading AI companies.
In 1980 he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an IA system that surpassed the American player of Othello with the best ranking and later exercised as executive at Microsoft Research and as president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee positively valued previous U.S. government technological competitions, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Agency (DARPA), and wondered when the next one would take place to identify the next visionaries.
"U.S. researchers often have to work hard to obtain public scholarships," Lee said.
According to Lee, "it's not China that takes academic leaders; it's companies."
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired university eminences to work in the AI field.
Lee commented that the U.S. task in the field of AI could also be driven by changes in immigration policy.
“I think you should automatically offer permanent residence cards to the PhDs in AI,” he added.
In July 2017, the China State Council presented its latest-generation artificial intelligence development plan.
"The National Foundation for Natural Sciences in China grants funding to people from academic institutions in the same way as the Foundation for Natural Sciences and other U.S. public agencies give money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower than China," Lee said.
At the beginning of the year, the Department of Defence of the United States set up a Joint Artificial Intelligence Centre designed to involve industrial partners and academic institutions, and the White House announced the establishment of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, DARPA announced an investment of US$2 billion this month in an initiative called AI Next.
With regard to the Foundation of Natural Sciences, it currently allocates more than 100 million USDs a year to research in AI.
In the meantime, no measures have been implemented for months in connection with US legislation that was intended to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians hold a referendum to decide whether to change the country's name
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people held a referendum on the change of name to the "Republic of the North of Macedonia", a measure that would resolve a dispute that has existed for decades with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's accession applications to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that its northern neighbour's name constitutes a claim from its territory and has prohibited its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments reached agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argued that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has stated that he will not participate in the referendum, and a boycott campaign is doubtful whether the minimum necessary participation of 50% will be reached to ensure that the referendum is valid.
The question given in the referendum paper is: "Are you in favour of accession to NATO and the EU, with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to achieve the accession of Macedonia, one of the countries created following the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, so that young people in Macedonia can live freely in the European Union, because it means that we will all have a safer life," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of parliamentarians have stated that it will abide by the result of the vote to make it decisive.
To change the name, a two-thirds majority is required in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission reported that there had been no irregularities at 1 p.m.
However, participation was only 16%, compared to 34% recorded in the last parliamentary elections held in 2016, in which 66% of registered people voted.
“I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski to Skopje in the capital.
Prime Minister Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted at the referendum held in Macedonia on the country's change of name, which would open the way for accession to the European Union and NATO in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
Before the Parliament of Skopje, 54 - year - old Vladimir Kavvarkov was preparing a small stage and setting chairs in front of the tents installed by the people who would boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to stick to it with our head, not the back door," said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can go to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev states that NATO integration will be accompanied by more than necessary investments in Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of over 20%.
"I think the vast majority will vote in favour of it, because more than 80% of citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev pointed out before depositing his paper.
Zaev said a "yes" would mean "confirmation of our future".
In a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Political Research Institute, between 30% and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, a figure below the minimum necessary participation.
According to the results of another survey, directed by the Macedonian channel Telma TV, 57% of the polls are scheduled to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said he would vote 'yes'.
For the referendum to be valid, participation must be 50% plus a vote.
A failure in the referendum would be the first hard time for pro-Western government policy since it took over last May last year.
Watch the video: Sergio Agüero, from Manchester City, makes a goal after regattaing all Brighton's defense
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling cancelled Brighton's defense in Manchester City victory goes for 2 to 0 in the disputed match at Etihad Stadium, Manchester, England last Saturday.
Aguro scored a goal in the 65th minute in a play that seemed ridiculously simple.
The Argentine front received a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He left at a speed between three defenses of Brighton, scratching what was going on in his footsteps on the playground.
Then, Agüero was surrounded by four green t-shirts.
He ran a defense before he got over a few more on the edge of Brighton's area.
Then he made a pass on his left that found Sterling.
The English frontman returned the ball to the first touch, inside the area, in Agüero, which with his right leg beat the doorman of Brighton, Mathew Ryan, with a jute that hung inside the net on the right side.
“Aguro has foot trouble,” Pep Guardiola, coach of the City, told journalists.
"We decided I'd play between 55 and 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he scored a goal at the time."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in fighting for the Premier League.
His goal came in the 29th minute.
In that play, Agüero received the ball in depth in the field of Brighton and
He made a beautiful past in space on the left side towards Leroy Sane.
Sane drove the ball before putting it in Sterling on the long stick.
Sky Blues' leader finished the ball inside the network before leaving the bottom line.
The City faces the Hoffenheim on Tuesday in part of the Champions League group phase at 18:55 a.m. at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Playing, with no options, wants to remove the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the play-off fight, there were not many reasons to force another opening.
But Scherzer, very competitive, looks forward to going out to the shuttle monticle on Sunday that comes against the Colorado Rockies, in case the Rockies, who hold a game of advantage over Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western National League, have a chance to play off.
The Rockies secured a game with the win for 5 to 2 against the Nationals Friday night, but they're still trying to get their first division title.
"Though we don't play anything, at least we can go out knowing the environment here in Denver, and knowing that the other team will probably fight every point at the highest level, as no one has done this year.
Why would I want to lose this game?"
The Nationals still have to announce an opening launcher for Sunday, but they are apparently determined to let Scherzer drop if this situation is given.
Scherzer, who would do his 34th opening, held a heating session on Thursday and launched on Sunday, on his usual day of rest.
Washington's right-wing launcher has an 18-7 record, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strike eliminations in 220 2/3 tickets this season.
Trump does a meeting in West Virginia
The president referred indirectly to the situation surrounding his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while talking about the importance of Republican participation in half-term elections.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
It's five weeks away for one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is one of the great, great, I don't see myself, but I really do, so I am everywhere fighting for the fantastic candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "You can see this horrible group of Democrats, it's happening right now.
They are determined to regain power by all means necessary, they see their mischief, their bad intentions.
They don't care who they hurt, over who they have to go through to get power and control, that's what they want: power and control, but we won't give them."
The mission of the Democrats, he said, is "resisting and obstructing."
"And this can be seen in the last four days," he replied, "and called out the Democrats "enraged, mean, dirty and false."
Trump mentioned Diane Feinstein, the highest-ranking democratic senator on the Senate Judicial Committee, which led to a strong public shout.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did you filter the document?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, no, wait a minute... this was a very bad body language expression, the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a diverse party.
It's intolerant with those who say what they think.
When the Momentum activists from my local party voted to censure me, I was not surprised.
After all, I'm the last of a series of British parliamentarians to whom we've been told we're not welcome, all to say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was treated similarly because he manifested himself resolutely against anti-Semitism.
In my case, with the motion of censure, I was criticized for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically, they are similar issues to which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
On the notice of the Friday meeting of the Labour Party in Nottingham, it was reported that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the meetings of the General Committee held on Friday night have been exactly like that.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings, and it has long forgotten the promise of "more generous and kind" policies, if it ever existed.
It is increasingly evident that divergent views are not tolerated by the Labour Party, and each opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable for the party's leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, as colleagues with whom he had previously thought to share a similar political vision expected me to take a 180th turn and take positions that I would never have adopted, whether on national security or on the single EU market.
Whenever I speak in public, say what I'm saying, social media is filled with aggressive messages calling for me not to renew my candidacy, denounce downtown policies and I'm told I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And that doesn't just happen to me.
In fact, I know I'm luckier than some of my colleagues, because the messages I receive are usually political.
I'm impressed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who are faced every day with a stream of sexist and racist attacks, and they don't crash.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is how the level of abuse has become normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn declared last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer such a diverse party, and with each motion of "untrustworthy" or every change in the rules of selection, the party is becoming more tense.
In the last two years I have received a lot of advice and I have been advised to keep my head down, not so expressive and "it would be all right."
But I didn't get into politics for that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, in my time of study, stimulated by thatcher's negligent government, which left my whole class literally down, I have tried to defend better public services for those who need it most, whether as local councillor or as government minister.
I've never hidden my policy, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East would ever doubt my political positions and points of disagreement with the current direction.
To those who promoted the motion Friday, I would say that at a time when the country is walking towards a Brexit that will harm homes, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy in my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But, in fact, the message I want to convey is not addressed to Nottingham Momentom, but to my constituents, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of non-renewal of my candidacy or any political interest will prevent you from acting, according to my opinion, in the interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: some battered Ayr lead leadership
Two last-minute rehearsals distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that the Ayr deserved the victory in this vibrant party of Lieutenant's Premiership day.
The Ayrs, who are the only downtrodden ten team, take first place at the classification table.
In the end, the local team imposed itself thanks to its defensive superiority and the fact that it knew how to take better advantage of the opportunities, and coach Peter Murchie had reason to be satisfied.
"The parties we've played so far have tested us and we're still stuck, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “Congratulations for the Ayr have taken advantage of opportunities better than we have. ”
The 14th-minute trial of Grant Anderson, converted by Frazier Climo, put forward the Ayrs, but a yellow card for the Scottish international Rory Hughes, surrendered by the Warriors party, allowed Melrose to take advantage of numerical superiority and Jason Baggot noted an unconverted essay.
Climo extended the advantage of the Ayrs with a sanction and, just in half, wrote down and converted a trial to put score 17-5 in favor of the Ayrs at rest.
But the Melrose started well the second part and Patrick Anderson's trial, converted by Baggot, reduced the differences to five points.
Then, the party interrupted for a long time because of the serious injury Ruaridh Knott suffered, who retired in the bunker, and at the dam the Ayr extended the distance again with a Stafford McDowall trial converted by Climo.
Next, the alternate captain Blair Macpherson was admonished with a yellow card and, again, the Melrose took advantage of one more man's superiority with an unconverted trial of Bruce Colvine at the end of a few moments of strong pressure.
However, the local team reacted, and when Struan Hutchinson saw a yellow card to make a plate at Climo without a ball, from the sanctions alignment, MacPherson noted a counter-testing behind the penetrating Ayr mole.
Climo scored, as he had done almost since the dam, after Kyle Rowe picked up a shot of David Armstrong and put the ball on Gregor Henry's third line to record the fifth rehearsal of the local team.
The Star of the Still Game series seems to be ready to start a new career in the restaurant sector.
Ford Kieran, star of the Still Game series, seems to be ready to go to the hospital sector, after it has been discovered that he has been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, who has been writing and co-protagonizing Greg Hemphil, his comical partner for a long time.
The duo announced that the ninth season will be the last of the series, and Kiernan seems to be planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he's the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on it, although a source from The Scottish Sun pointed out that Kiernan intended to enter the "flowering sector of restoration" of Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, without coastline, expects the court to reopen the path to the Pacific
The sailors patrol their ship covered with bark in La Paz.
Public buildings wave a blue sea flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazons are enthralled by the motto: "The sea is ours by right.
Recovering it is a duty."
Across Bolivia's land without coastline, the memory of a lost coastline in Chile in a conflict of resources in the 19th century remains very vivid, as is the yearning to sail again across the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps the deepest in decades, while Bolivia awaits the resolution that the International Court of Justice will issue on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the impulse, a spirit of unity and serenity, and, no need to say, waits with a positive stance for the result," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the resolution of the TIJ on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague Court will dictate in favour of Bolivia's claim that, after decades of intermittent conversations, Chile is obliged to negotiate the concession of a sovereign exit to the sea for Bolivia.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president, who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has many hopes laid down in Monday's resolution.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised last August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the Court would decide in favour of Bolivia and that if it did, things would not change much.
The United Nations agency based in the Netherlands has no power to award Chile and has established that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The resolution of the TIJ, which takes place only six months after the final submissions are made, indicates that the case “was not complicated,” said Peace Zárate, Chilean specialist in international law.
And far from seeing yourself in favor, Bolivia's cause may have experienced a backlog in the last four years.
"The current Bolivian administration has kidnapped the issue of access to the sea," Zárate pointed out.
"The belligerent rhetoric of Morales has affected any gesture of good will by Chile," he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be very difficult to keep conversations after this episode.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the Tribunal's decision-making was exceptionally rapid.
Next Monday Bolivia will have "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "put an end to 139 years of discrepancies, with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who remains one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, was using the maritime issue as a political cross.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The resolution is an opportunity to realize that we must overcome the past."
North Korea claims that nuclear disarmament will not occur unless it can be trusted in the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation won't eliminate nuclear weapons if he can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke last Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
The Minister urged the United States to keep the promises made during a summit held in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
His statements arrive at a time when it seems that the U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, is about to resume nuclear diplomacy stagnant more than three months after the summit held in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong One.
Ri says it's a chemera to think that the US's continued sanctions and objection to a statement that put an end to the Korean War can make North Korea ever kneel.
Washington distrusts accepting the statement if Pyongyang does not make significant disarmament moves before.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump want to hold a second summit.
However, there is a generalized skepticism about Pyongyang taking seriously the issue of renouncing an arsenal that the country considers the only means of ensuring its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion parades reveal the latest range of large hats, on its way to a main street near you
If you want to increase the size of your hat collection or you want to protect yourself completely from the sun, you don't have to look any more.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a range of extravagant hats of disproportionate dimensions of their SS19 collection, which brightened the style defined at the Paris Fashion Week.
This summer the Instagram has been scratched by very little practical hats, and these designers have brought their amazing creations to the gateway.
Valentino's outstanding piece was an exaggerated bee hat, adorned with a broad, feather-shaped wing that flooded the head of the models.
Among other oversized accessories, there were jeweled syndrias, a witch hat and even a pine, but these are not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of extrafollary masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the masks, of vivid colors, had sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than not of high seam.
One creation looked like a complete team of submarines, with tubes and glasses, while another seemed like an ice cream cone.
And if you follow the big trends of fashion, you're lucky.
Style observers predict that huge hats could be implanted in the main streets near you.
Large-sized hats climb the heels of "the Bomb", a straw hat, with two-foot wide wings, which everyone has brought, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the hat so impractical that it spread through social networks brought another great creation to the gateway: a bag of straw for the beach, almost as large as the model dressed in a bather that wore it.
The dark orange bag, decorated with raffia locks and finished with a white leather handle, was the highlight of the collection The SS19 Riviera by Jacquemus at the Paris Fashion Week.
The famous designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I hope to see people wearing large hats and beach bags on the main streets next summer. Considering that the designer has had a big impact, it would be a pity to ignore the demand for large-scale accessories.
John Edward: Language skills are essential for world citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a course of academic excellence that continued in 2018 with another series of excellent exam results, which is enhanced with individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students all over Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (CIS), are working to offer a service of the best level to students and parents.
The purpose of independent schools is to prepare students for further and higher education, for their career and for their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a custom school curriculum, we note that modern languages remain a matter of highly popular and desirable choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak a man in a language that he understands, you’ll get to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will reach his heart."
This is a very important reminder that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to build relationships and build trust with people from other countries.
From the recent results of the reviews of this year, we can see that languages lead the classification tables with the highest qualifications in independent schools.
68% of students studying foreign languages obtained the A superior score.
Data collected from 74 ISIS member schools reflected that 72% of students obtained A superior qualification in Mandarin, while 72% of German students, 69% of French students, and 63% of Spanish students also obtained an A.
This demonstrates that Scotland's independent schools support foreign languages as vital competences that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Today, languages, as a subject of choice, are kept in the same consideration as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey conducted by the United Kingdom Employment and Skills Commission revealed that 17% of the reasons given by entrepreneurs for the fact that it was difficult to cover vacancies were attributed to the lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills are increasingly needed to prepare young people for their future careers.
Since there are more and more potential job opportunities that require languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of a person’s choice of a career, having learned a second language, he or she will have a real advantage in the future with such a permanent skill.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person in front of competition.
According to a 2013 survey by YouGov among more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom, 75% did not speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, and the French, with 15% speakers, was the only language with a double digit percentage.
For this reason, investing in language teaching is important for children today.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developed economies, will give children better opportunities to find important work.
In Scotland there is diversity between schools in the languages they teach.
Some schools focus more on more traditional modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered to be more important for the United Kingdom in the future by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your son's interest is, he'll always be able to choose between a series of languages in independent schools, which have staff teaching specialists in this area.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the necessary skills to succeed, regardless of what the future may be.
In today's global trading environment, it cannot be denied that languages continue to be of vital importance to the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be regarded as "international communicative competences".
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, diversity and excellence to young Scottish people.
We've got to do it right.

LeBron will start with the Lakers in San Diego Sunday
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James play his first game with Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play the first pre-season game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
But you still have to determine the minutes you're going to play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said at the official Lakers' place.
Mike Trudell, a Lakers journalist, tweeted that James will probably play a few minutes.
After early training this week, James was asked about his plans for the six Lakers' pre-seasonal calendar.
“I don’t need pre-season games in this phase of my career to be ready,” he said.
Trump's Summit in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump starts a wave of campaigning tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's the first of five Trump scheduled meetings for the next week, including visits to sympathetic places, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the confirmation vote for his candidate to cover the vacancy of the Supreme Court is pending, Trump intends to obtain support for the next half-term election, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when the votes are cast in November.
What time is Trump's meeting in West Virginia tonight and how can you see it online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
Trump's meeting in West Virginia can be seen online in the link below, through live video broadcast via YouTube.
Trump probably aborts the hearing he started this week with the candidate nominated to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who was subjected to charges of sexual abuse he's facing, while the Senate's planned confirmation vote remains pending for a week and the FBI investigates the case.
But the main objective of this wave of rallies is to help Republicans who come to the delicate elections in November to collect momentum.
Therefore, the five meetings of President Trump's campaign scheduled for the next week are aimed at “stimulating volunteers and supporters, while Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives, according to Reuters.
“Congress control is as important to his agenda as the president will travel to as many states as he can, as we head for a season of raided campaign,” said a spokesperson from Trump who refused to be identified, according to Reuters.
Tonight's meeting, scheduled at Wesbanco Arena, Wheeling, could bring together "Ohio and Pennsylvania supporters, and attract the coverage of Pittsburgh's media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time Trump visits West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate in the West Virginia Senate, who is getting unfavourable results in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to boost the polls,” commented Simon Haeder, political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: American team shows their ambition to keep hopes alive in front of individual Sunday parties
After three unequal sessions, Saturday afternoon ants were probably what this Ryder Cup needed.
The tilting pendulum of dynamic is an invented sport concept, in which players really believe, especially in competitions like this.
So which side is the positive dynamics on now?
"They had a six-point advantage and now it's four, so I think we're in a little positive mood," said Jordan Spieth as he left at the end of the day.
Obviously, Europe has an advantage, four points ahead, with twelve more at stake.
Americans, as Spieth says, feel that the wind blows a little in their favor and have many reasons to be animated, largely by the state in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both have three points of four.
Spieth's been lethal from tea to green and he's setting an example.
Gutural shouts of celebration rose in intensity as he continued his round and put a crucial putt to tie the fourth game, when he and Thomas had been two down after two holes.
He celebrated the putt that made them win the game in hole 15 with a similar cry, of the kind that indicates that he believes that the American team is not yet out of the competition.
"You have to try your best and worry about your own party," Spieth pointed out.
That's all these players have left now.
18 holes to leave the fingerprint.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed feeling of Ryder Cup.
The strange but lovely European couple have four out of four and make no mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't do a crazy Saturday afternoon, and also avoided the madies Saturday morning and Friday afternoon, and the last nine holes Friday morning.
For this result and the way their energy seems to flow to and from public bullying, it is reaffirmed that they are players to beat on Sunday, and there is no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to close a possible European victory while the sun sets on Le Golf National.
Preferably both in different holes at the same time.
However, talking about European glory seemed premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly ended up with Sergio Garcia, the morning fourball hero, who partnered with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes plunged Spanish and Swedish into a hole they never had a chance to get out of.
Sunday, though, there's no one who can help you get out of the hole.
Fourballs and forsomes are very fascinating to see for the interactions between the mating, the advice they give and the advice they don't give, and the way a strategy can change from one to another.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and will face the last day with an important advantage, but this ant session has shown that the US team has the motivation to fight than some, especially in the United States, have questioned.
Europe reaches the end of Ryder Cup with a favorable score of 10-6
Europe will face the last day of the Ryder Cup with a comfortable advantage after finishing the forkballs and forsomes of Saturday with a 10 to 6 victory over the United States.
The inspired duo formed by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari made a great effort to achieve two victories against a Tiger Woods in difficulty and to leave his record, so far, at four points in Le Golf National.
The European team, led by Thomas Bjorn, who aspired to retain the trophy he lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated an American team that was not right in the morning ovens and put the series in 3-1.
The U.S. had more resistance to the foursomes and won two matches, but they couldn't reduce the differences.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points at the 12 individual Sunday games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to achieve four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, known as "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are only the second couple who earn four points in their first four games in Ryder Cup's history.
After slamming Woods and Patrick Reed into the ovens, they called a brilliant performance to beat a deflated Woods and American debutante Bryson Dechambeau for an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who had been dragged into two games on Saturday, showed sporadic genius sparks, but he has lost 19 of 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes, and seven consecutives.
Justin Rose, who did not participate in the morning ovens, re-married Henrik Stenson in the furnaces and fell for two to one against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, classified as the world's first and third.
However, Europe did not have everything in its face on a pleasant and windy day in southwest Paris.
Jordan Spieth, three times tournament champion, and Justin Thomas set a Saturday reference point for Americans getting two points.
They won a strong victory for 2 to 1 against Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls and later won Poulter and Rory McIllroy again for 4 to 3 in the foursomes, after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history a team had put a four-point difference in individual parties, although Furyk's title team just needs to tie it together to keep it.
However, after being the second best for two days, it seems that a counterattack coming Sunday is out of range.
North Korea declares that it will not be unilaterally disarmed "in any way" if no signs of trust are appreciated
The North Korean Foreign Minister informed the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were intensifying their distrust in the United States and that under such circumstances the country would not unilaterally eliminate its nuclear weapons in any way.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization's Annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken “significant measures of good will” during the previous year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear testing centre and committing itself to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not observe any responses in consonance with the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will not begin disarmament unilaterally in any way."
While Ri resumed the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a phased-out denuclearization approach for which North Korea would be rewarded as he gradually took action, his statements seemed significant because he did not reject the unilateral denuclearization of the whole, as Pyongyang had already done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a US President and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim pledged to work on the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea has tried to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has reported that Pyongyang must first eliminate its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted the call to relax the harsh international sanctions imposed in North Korea.
"The United States insists that denuclearisation must first occur and increase the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its objective in a coercive manner, in addition to opposing the "war-end declaration," said Ri.
"The perception that sanctions will make us kneel is a burning of people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that continued sanctions are intensifying our distrust."
Ri did not refer to plans to hold a second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader highlighted in the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If the part involved in the denuclearization issue were South Korea instead of the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this stagnation situation."
However, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from what he held last year, when he declared to the UN General Assembly that pointing to the U.S. territory with North Korean missiles was inevitable after President "Mr. Evil" Trump named Kim from "Rocket Man" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for her courage to take disarmament measures, but said that much remains to be done and sanctions must be maintained until North Korea is denuclearized.
Last Wednesday, Trump said there was no deadline for this and "it doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should award Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared on Thursday to the UN Security Council: “The enforcement of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without exception until we confirm complete and definitive denuclearisation.”
The Security Council has led sanctions in North Korea unanimously since 2006 on a bet to cut the funding of Pyongyang's ballistic and nuclear missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri outside the UN General Assembly and then reported that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go very well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, but within a few hours North Korea accused him of making “own demands of a gangster.”
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile centre and a nuclear complex if the United States took “consonance measures”.
He said that Kim had told him that the "consonance measures" he was looking for were the security measures Trump had promised in Singapore, in addition to actions towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on rest habits
This year, a new course at Harvard University has allowed its students to sleep more, in an attempt to fight the growing culture of studying all night, stimulated by caffeine.
One scholar observed that students at number one university in the world are often dismissed from basics about how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of Sound Medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of his species in the United States.
He was inspired to create the course after giving a talk about the impact sleep deprivation had on learning.
"At the end of the talk, a girl approached me and said, "Why are you telling me now, all this, in my last year?"
He said no one had ever talked to him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he reported to the newspaper The Telegraph.
In the course, implemented for the first time this year, the students are told the basic concepts about how good sound habits improve academic and sports performance in addition to general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the University, said that the University decided to introduce the course after learning that some students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The course, one hour long, includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a dorm, where students have to click on cups of coffee, curtains, bamboos and books to receive information about the effects of caffeine and light, about how sports performance affects sleeplessness, and about the importance of keeping a routine to go to sleep.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
Below is a map of the campus with interactive icons that encourages participants to think about its daily route.
“ We know that students’ conduct will not change immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know, as one has the right to know the health effects of smoking cigarettes," said Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride of staying awake all night still exists, he said, and added that modern technology and increasing pressure from students make sleep deprivation an increasing problem.
Making sure to enjoy a good-quality sleep for long enough should be a "secret weapon" of students to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, added, even to avoid gaining weight, as the deprivation of sleep puts the brain in mode of inanition and makes students always hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student of Physical Chemistry and Biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after attending one of his classes in the last year of his first year at Harvard.
Raymond commented that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to promote the course throughout the campus.
The next step, he expects, is to ask postgraduate students to conduct a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students take into account the fact that they are alarmed when they go to sleep and when they wake up, and that they are aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can alter the harmony of the circaday rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal ends with Gerard's men
Dolly Menga's goal condemns Steven Gerrard's disarrayed team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston's house, which means another hit outside.
Hemox's team was trying to add their first home victory from last February win for 4 to 1 in St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted the second defeat on Gerard in 18 matches as a coach to leave his team on the drift, 8 points from the Hearts, unstoppable leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored the goal seven minutes before the half part, and it never seemed that Rangers, lacking inspiration, were about to equal the marker.
While Rangers now fall into sixth square, Livingston goes up to third position, behind the Hibernian by difference of goals.
And Rangers could face further difficulties later, as the Calum Spence line judge needed medical attention for a head injury caused by an object apparently launched from the mercy.
Gerard made eight changes to the alignment that the Ayr swept into the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went out with the same eleven headlines that he pulled a point against the Hearts last week; surely he was satisfied with the way his well-organized team suffocated their rivals at all times.
While Rangers dominated possession, Livingston created more danger when they had the ball.
In fact, they should have marked the two-minute party, when Menga's first intervention left Scot Pittman alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder threw away and squandered the great occasion.
A sudden launch of Keaghan Jacobs encountered Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive companion Alan Lithgow only made a detour to the rear pole.
The Rangers took control, but they seemed to have more hope than they had in their third game.
Alfredo Morelos really believed he should have had a 15-minute sentence, since he and Steven Lawless met, but referee Steven Thomson ignored Colombian claims.
The Rangers only led two shots to bear the first part, but Ibrox's first porter, Liam Kelly, had no problem with Lassana Coulibaly's head and Ovie Ejaria's docile front.
While the first act of the Livi in the minute 34 might have been against the race, no one can deny that they deserved it only because of their efforts.
Again, the Rangers couldn't deal with Jacobs' working play.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm to choose Menga for a simple final.
Gerard acted at the pause by changing Coulibaly to Ryan Kent, and the change had an impact almost immediately, since the extreme had a pass on to Morelos, although the imposing Kelly ran into the blockade.
However, the Livingstons continued to capture visitors' attention by playing exactly as they like, with Lithgow and Halkett making long passes, one after the other.
Holt's gang could have surrendered the direction to the final stages, but McGregor stood firm in rejecting Jacobs before Lithgow made a detour from the choir.
The Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton still demanded a final penalty for a dispute with Jacobs, but again Thomson turned his eyes wide.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and counting... the day the physicist of the future, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that finally gave rise to the device we know as the Geiger counter.
The counter Geiger, which is a pillar of science since then, has also become a pile of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, apparently failed cowboy physicists:
Man: "What's the matter with that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, which is used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put those headphones on, you can hear the effects of atoms emanating from radioactivity on minerals."
Evans: "Surely it's popping up now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention bearing his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" and eliminate malignant cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory.
You can "see" a protein common to many cancers and then reinject them
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
One woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize the malignant cells, saw ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory to "see" a protein present in many types of cancer (HER2) and then injecting them again.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute of Bethesda, Maryland (USA): "The results we have obtained suggest that we have a promising vaccine."
Her2 protein " favors the growth of various types of cancer," including breast, ovary, lung, and colorectal, said Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach is to extract immune cells from patients and to "show" these cells how to treat cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West became part of a pro-Trump diatribe with a MAGA cap after his performance in the SNL program.
It didn't end well.
Kanye West was called to the studio during the Saturday Night Live program after a chaotic performance in which he congratulated US President Donald Trump, and said he would present himself at the 2020 election.
After his third song of the night, entitled Ghost Town, in which he wore a Make America Great Again hat, began to criticize the Democrats and reiterate their support for Trump.
"Whenever I talk to white people they say to me, "How can you like Trump if he's racist?
Well, if I cared about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago," he said.
The SNL program began with a parody of Matt Damon, in which Hollywood's star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's witness in front of the Senate Judicial Committee for complaints of sexual assault filed by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't issued, comedian Chris Rock uploaded the recording of West's disapproval on social media.
It wasn't clear if Rock intended to ridicule West with the publication.
However, West complained to the audience that he was not well treated in the backseat because of his hat.
"They threatened me in the background.
I was told not to go out with that hat on.
I was harassed.
And then they say I'm in a lower position," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the bottom position?" as he said he'd put on Superman's coat because they couldn't tell him what to do. "Do you want the world to move forward?
Try to love."
His comments provoked the audience's shouts at least twice and the program team seemed embarrassed, according to Variety, that he had a reporter who explained to the publication: "The entire study was completely silent."
West acted as a replacement for the last hour of Ariana Grande, the former of which, rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West left much of the audience perplexed by the interpretation of song and Love it, disguised as Perrier's bottle.
West got support from the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted, "To one of the bravest spirits: Thanks for unravelling the crowd."
But the host of the debate program, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was just "being who it is and that it's absolutely wonderful."
"But I have chosen not to reward someone (buying his music or clothes or supporting his "art") who I believe adopts and spread an ideology that harms my community.
He's free.
And so do we," he added.
Before the program, raper announced on Twitter that the name had been changed and that it was now "the former being known as Kanye West."
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow the steps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper colleague, Snoop Dogg, was previously called Snoop Lion and Prince's missing music legend changed its name to a symbol and later to the artist known as Prince.
Prosecution of attempted murder for stabbing in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed on Friday in eastern Belfast.
According to the police, the incident took place in Ballyhacklove.
The defendant is expected to appear before the court of first instance of Belfast on Monday.
The D.A. will review the charges.
The star of the throne game, Kit Harington, denounces a toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known to represent the role of swordsman Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series throne game.
However, the 31-year-old actor has denounced the stereotype of virile hero, stating that these roles imply that young boys often think they must be strong to be respected.
In an interview with Culture magazine in The Sunday Times, Kit said that he believed that "something had gone wrong" and that he questioned how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married the co-protagonist of the throne game, Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, has admitted that being quite determined to face this problem.
"Personally, now I wonder where we've been wrong about masculinity," he says.
"What have we taught men during their development in relation to the problem we now experience?"
According to Kit, television may be responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its virile characters.
He added, "What is born and what is acquired?
What does it show on TV and on the streets that makes young boys feel like they have to have this facet of manhood?
I think it's one of the big questions of our time: how do we change it?
Because something's definitely wrong with young boys."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not make any prequel or sequel to the Game of Thrones when the end of the series is scheduled for the next summer, saying he is full of battles and horses.
Starting in November, Kit will feature a replacement for Sam Shepard's True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that knowing his partner Rose is the best that has provided him with Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in the series, so she gave me my future family and my life ahead," she said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the love of the character who represents Kit, Jon Snow, in the winning fantasy series of an Emmy.
The couple got married in June 2018 at Leslie’s family farm in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase in our cases of 14%
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected in the country, according to health workers.
Only the second quarter of 2018 declared 40,000 new cases.
The vast majority of new cases are sexually transmitted, unlike what happened in the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some regions of China because of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who are contracting HIV for this cause has been reduced to almost zero, according to statements by Chinese health workers at a conference in Yunnan Province.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is a serious problem for China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT collective is common.
Considering the country's conservative values, studies estimate that between 70 and 90 percent of men who have homosexual relations will end up marrying a woman.
Many of the transmissions of disease are due to a lack of appropriate precautions for sexual relations.
Since 2003, the government of China has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee has leaked data from Republican Party senators and dismantles "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
The U.S. representative Maxine Waters reported on Saturday allegations that a member of her staff had published personal information from three Republican senators in the Wikipedia pages of the legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the demands were critical and far-right websites.
"False lies, lies and more contemptible lies," Waters said in a Twitter statement.
Supposedly, the published information contained the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday and was published by someone unknown in the Capitol during a session of the Senate commission on complaints of sexual abuse against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was leaked after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publications was related to the Waters Office and revealing information from a Waters staff member, denounced the Capitol.
"This unfounded denunciation is completely false and a mere lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff, the identity, the personal data and the security of which have been compromised by these false and fraudulent allegations, was not responsible in any way for this information leak.
This unsubstantiated complaint is completely false and a pure invention."
Waters' statement quickly generated criticism, including that of White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is full of indignation," wrote Fleischer.
"That makes you think you don't have the temper to be a member of Congress.
When someone's accused of something he hasn't done, he doesn't have to be angry.
You don't have to be challenging.
You don't have to question the prosecutor's motives.
You have to keep calm and quiet."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to Judge Kavanaugh's criticism of Democrats, whom critics accused of being too angry during the Thursday session.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who presented himself to overthrow Waters in the elections of half-legislature, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Importing if it's true," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted the relevant authorities and security forces of these fraudulent statements.
"We'll make sure the criminals reveal themselves," he continued, "and they'll be legally held responsible for all the actions they've taken and that they've hurt each and every member of my staff."
Criticism of Johnny English Strikes Again: limited spy parody of Rowan Atkinson
It is already a tradition to look for references to Brexit in any new film with a British focus, and this reposition of Johnny English's franchise of action-media parody, which was born in 2003 with Johnny English and reappeared in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn, not an exception.
Is this humorous self-satisty about how despicable we are going to be a new export opportunity from the country?
In any case, the incompetent out-eyed and rubber-faced Johnny English has been able to renew for a second time his license to twist everything, his name indicates more than anything else that is a comical creation designed for non-English-speaking territories with a tradition of going to cinema.
Of course, it's the stupid secret agent who, despite his rare claims of liquid glamur, has a bit of Clouseau, a point of Mr. Bean and a touch of this guy who brings a single note to the theme of Firecars at the 2012 London Olympics inaugural ceremony.
Originally, it was based on the mysterious international traveler Atkinson who represented the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, where he was sowing chaos everywhere.
There's one or two good times on this last trip of JE.
I loved the Johnny English who was approaching a helicopter dressed in medieval armor and helical leaves were repeating it to his helmet.
You see the gift Atkinson has for physical comedy, but humor seems quite smooth and strangely superfluous, especially because "serious" cinematographic marks like 007 and the Impossible Mission now include comedy as an ingredient.
Humor seems intended for children rather than adults and, to me, Johnny English's absurd adventures are not as resourceful or focused as the dumb gags of Mr. Bean's character representing Atkinson.
The repeatedly topical premise now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
An IT pirate has infiltrated the British supersecret web spy network and has revealed the identities of all British agents on the ground, which causes the dismay of the service agent, a unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last resort for a prime minister who is a pretentious and harassed figure, who has already suffered a total collapse of lack of political popularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of herself with this character pressed by Teresa-May, but the script does not come any further.
Your intelligence advisors inform you that, as each active spy is in danger, he will have to recover one from retirement.
And this includes Mock Johnny English, now employed as a professor at some luxury institution, but teaching off-the-line classes about how to become a covert agent, with some good gags, such as when English offers a spying academy that looks like a rock school.
English is returned quickly to Whitehall for an emergency meeting with his dry skater Bough, a role once again represented by Ben Miller.
Now Bough is a married man, bound to the commander of a submarine, an enthusiastic role, in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So Batman and Robin from when things get very ugly in His Majesty's secret service come into action once again and find Olga Kurylenko the spectacular "fatal woman" Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister falls dangerously under the spell of the technological charismatic billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, represented by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous madness: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French fast-eating restaurant, they seem chaos by smuggling on board the luxury yacht of Volta and English causes great confusion in trying to use a virtual reality helmet to familiarize themselves with the interior of Volta's house.
All the stops have certainly been drawn from this last sequence, but with all the simplicity and the noise it presents, it all seems like a child program.
Pretty normal stuff.
As with Johnny English films, it has not been helpful to think whether the film industry has given Rowan Atkinson a role that does justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is designing a plan for the British to have a four-day workweek and cover five days.
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn will have to consider a radical plan whereby the British will work four days a week and charge five.
Supposedly, the party wants the bosses of the companies to pass the savings obtained with the artificial intelligence revolution (IA) to the workers giving them a more festive day.
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but they would get the same pay.
According to sources, the idea would fit the party's economic agenda and plans to tilt the country for the workers.
The shift to a week's work for four days has the support of Trades Union Congress trade union confederation as a method for workers to benefit from economic change.
An experienced Labour Party source stated in The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
It won't be overnight, but a four-day workweek is an aspiration that fits the party's perspective of balancing the economy for the worker and the party's general industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, since the Green Party promised a four-day workweek during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party does not support this aspiration in a joint manner at present.
According to a Labour Party spokesman, "A four-day workweek is not party politics and the party is not considering it."
The shadow minister John McDonnell used last week's party conference to detail his view of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell expressed his determination to restore the power of anonymous directors and speculators to public service companies.
The Minister's shady plans also imply that water business shareholders may not recover the entire investment, as the Labour government could apply "deducts" for the crimes it perceives.
It has also confirmed plans to place employees in business boards and create inclusive property funds to deliver 10% of the shares of private sector firms to employees, who expect to collect annual dividends worth up to 500 GBP.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tells "60 Minutes" if the FBI Kavanaugh investigation could change their mind.
The FBI investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote of his appointment to the Supreme Court at least one week, and raised the question as to whether the Agency's findings could influence any Republican senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview to be published on Sunday, the 60-minute correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could shed light on anything that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I'm serious," said Kennedy.
"At the session I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when it happened and the accusations were made public, and I asked him if he had.
He was firm, determined and sure."
But Graham's vote seems to be on fire.
"I have my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and would present an explosive accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett flatly denied it," said Graham referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of the people I appoint will be able to verify.
He's 36.
I don't see anything changing again."
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Have you done anything to reduce poverty?
New York will host this Saturday the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event, which presents a program of absolutely impressive stars, carrying out an equally impressive mission: to eradicate poverty in the world.
In the seventh edition this year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people meeting in the Great Lawn area of Central Park not only to enjoy performances such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to awaken awareness of the global objective of the event of ending extreme poverty in the world before 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international defense group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who help fight it actively.
To receive a free entry for the event (whether someone wants to pay a VIP ticket), the attendees had to do a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call or any other activity to awaken awareness about the goal of ending poverty.
What success has Global Citizen achieved now that she has 12 years left to reach her goal?
The idea of awarding people with a free concert is a good way to persuade them to demand a call for action or just one more case than we call "clictivism" (do you think it makes a difference to sign an online petition or send a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have registered more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters, which have helped to achieve various goals.
It states that these actions have helped to stimulate global leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion, which will have affected the lives of more than 2.250 million people before 2030.
In early 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, of which at least USD 10 billion has already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that at present the protected funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments include the The Power of Nutrition Foundation, an investor and director association in the United Kingdom, which undertakes to "help children grow up as much as possible" and promises to send $35 million to Rwanda to help combat malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 Global Citizens tweets.
"Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and members of Global Citizens, like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into one page of history," the Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also explained that after more than 5,000 actions called for in the United Kingdom to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced the financing of a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the P+Fs on their website, he asked, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied, "It will be a long and hard road, sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements we're going to win, because we're stronger together."
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who will be performing at the New York New York event, who will present Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy as a "block" to hinder Russian energy exports (Secretaria d'Interior)
Washington can, "if necessary" use the Navy to prevent Russian energy from hitting markets, including those in the Middle East, has revealed US Secretary of Interior Ryan Zinke, according to Washington Examiner.
Zinke has claimed that Russia's intervention in Syria, mainly where it operates with the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think the reason they are in the Middle East is their will to negotiate with energy, as they already do in Eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe," he said.
According to the officer, there are ways and means to deal with this issue.
"The United States has the capacity, along with the Navy, to ensure that the sea lanes are open and, if necessary, for blocking, to prevent its energy from entering the market," he said.
Zinke was addressing the participants at the event hosted by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that self-defined itself as the "power consumer voice" in the United States.
He compared Washington's strategies to negotiate with Russia and Iran, and pointed out that they are actually the same.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia is about to take advantage of and replace fuels," he said, indicating that Russia has only one resource, as its economy depends on fossil fuels.
Statements arrive while Trump administration has been on a mission to boost the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, instead of Russia, the most economical option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to exit the North Stream 2 "indecent" gas pipeline project, which, according to Trump, turned Berlin into Moscow's "captive".
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the North Stream 2 pipeline project, which cost $11 billion and will double the capacity of the existing pipeline at 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is simply due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to pressure and that consumers must be able to choose suppliers, declared Russia's Minister of Energy Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with US Department of Energy Secretary Rick Perry, held in Moscow in September.
The US stance has provoked a negative response from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main organisation of the German sector, IDF (Federation of German Industries), has called on the United States to withdraw EU energy policy from bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes in our energy supply," declared Dieter Kempf, director of BDI after a recent meeting between German chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren has stated that she will "think of" her candidacy for the presidency in 2020.
Senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren stated on Saturday that she would "think of" her candidacy for the presidency after the elections of half-legislature.
During a municipal meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidacy.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington and fix the government's fracture, for women to hold high office," said The Hill.
"After November 6, I will take my candidacy seriously."
Warren intervened on President Donald Trump during the municipal meeting and said that "he was taking the country in the wrong direction."
"I'm frankly concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren has been frank in his criticisms at Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the election."
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own voters believed that it should not be submitted by 2020.
Some fifty-eight percent of the "probable" Massachusetts voters said that the senator should not be presented, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe survey.
Some thirty-two percent would support the candidacy.
The survey revealed a broader support for the candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favour of a possible candidacy and 48 percent against it.
Other high profile names among Democrats who took into account a possible candidacy by 2020 include Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially disclose his decision in January, according to Associated Press.
Sarah Palin quotes TEPT Track Palin's affection for Donald Trump's rally
Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq after enlisting on September 11, 2007
On Monday night he was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident
"With what is happening to my own son since he came back, I can understand other families suffering from TEPT ramifications and some of the emotional wounds our soldiers return with," he told the audience at a meeting of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "the elephant in the room" and said the following about his son and other veterans of war: "They turn a little bit different, they get rough again, they wonder if there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots, as well as any other member of the army, have given the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, with a statement of domestic violence and armed restraint under the effects of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, spokesperson for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and DC support the challenge of a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence
18 state representatives and the district presented a friendly curiae on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged politics, according to NBC News.
The full name of the Grace vs Sessions case demand that the American Union for Civil Liberties presented in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
He said his partner "and the children of the violent gang member" assaulted her, but American officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, where a large number of asylum seekers are generated in the United States, as countries facing widespread gang problems and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy revoked a 2014 decision of the Immigration Appeals Board, which allowed undocumented immigrants to flee domestic violence to seek asylum.
The Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, declared on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation".
Federal laws require asylum applications to be awarded according to particular facts and circumstances of demand, and this prohibition infringes this principle, according to amicus curiae.
Lawyers also argued in the report that the policy that denies immigrants' entry harms the US economy, as it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and "provide necessary jobs".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gangs.
" Asylum is available to those who leave their country for persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion," said Sessions in their announcement on June 11 of this policy.
Asylum has never meant to alleviate all the problems, not even the most serious, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as human losses multiply in a spirit to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is getting more and more desperate.
"The atmosphere is very tense," said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma while reassuring her son with fever in an evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
"Every minute, an ambulance carries bodies.
Missing drinking water."
Residents have been seen to return to their destroyed homes to take flooded belongings and try to save what they can.
There are hundreds of injuries, and hospitals, damaged by the magnitude of 7.5 earthquake, are saturated.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who fractured his shoulder, are outside Palu's military hospital, as the patients are treated outside because of the loud shaking that is repeated.
Tears were denying her eyes as she explained how the violent earthquake shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel where she was with her wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save us.
He was trapped in the ruins of the wall, I think," explained Haris to Associated Press, adding that his family had attended a town wedding.
"I heard my wife ask for help crying and then I didn't hear her anymore.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're okay."
The U.S. ambassador accuses China of harassing with "advertising ads."
A week after an official Chinese publication published a four-page ad in an American newspaper promoting the mutual advantages of trade between the United States and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
President Donald Trump addressed China Daily's payment supplement on Wednesday to The Des Moines Register, Iowa's state's best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of getting involved in the 6 November U.S. Congress elections, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to get involved in the U.S. elections marked what American officials told Reuters that it was a new phase of the Washington campaign to intensify pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to insert ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a trade war that is intensifying and has seen oranges boosting on mutual imports.
China's vengeful oranges at the beginning of the commercial war were intended to punish state exporters, such as Iowa, who supported Trump's Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former Governor of Iowa for a long time, a major exporter of agricultural products in China, said Beijing had harmed US workers, farmers and companies.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion paper at The Des Moines Register of The Sunday: "It's redoubled harassment by posting propaganda advertisements to our free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the beloved American tradition of freedom of expression and free press to insert a payment announcement to The Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the other hand, at the kiosk down here in Beijing, you'll find few dissenting voices and you won't see any real reflection of the disparate opinions Chinese citizens can have on China's worrying economic path, as the media are dominated by the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers avoided the offer to publish" his article, but did not say the name of the publication.
Republicans turn women's voters away before the election of half-legislature with the Kavanaugh disaster, the analysts warn
As many of the leading Republicans support and defend the candidate for Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, who faces various sexual assault requests, analysts have warned that they will see a negative response, especially among women, to the upcoming elections of half-legislature.
The emotions surrounding this case are extremely high and most Republicans are already officially showing that they want to take a step forward with a vote.
These things cannot be undone," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School at Syracuse University, in The Hill for an article that was published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute pressure (R-Arizona) to conduct an FBI investigation will be sufficient to calm the angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, neither tomorrow nor November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, chief advisor and national spokesperson of the progressive group MoveOn, Friday, according to Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, Protestants shouted "November is coming!" (November comes) while protesting in the Senate lobby while Republicans controlling the Judicial Committee decided to continue Kavanaugh's appointment despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, according to Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will remain out of the picture," said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst at the news site.
"People say they've already been tall; it's true.
But it could have been more, especially among the voters of women from suburbs and younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who often don't vote while they don't like the president."
Even before Ford's public witness, where he detailed his applications for sexual assault against the High Court candidate, analysts suggested that a negative response could be given if Republicans pressed with confirmation.
"This has become a GOP mess," said Michael Steele, President of the Republican National Committee, earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the board vote or the final vote, nor about Kavanaugh sitting in the defendant's bank. It's also about how Republicans have handled this issue and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of U.S. Priorities, a group that helps to elect Democrats, on the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be divided between those who believe in Ford's star and Kavanaugh's witnesses, with the balance that is slightly tilted towards the last.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of the polls believe in Ford's testimony, while about 35 percent claim to believe in Kavanaugh in an uncertain or probable manner.
In addition, about 38 percent said that he believed that Kavanaugh had probably lied or had no doubt during his witness, while about 30 percent claimed the same from Ford.
After Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the applications filed by Ford and at least another complainant, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judicial Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh had assaulted him under the effects of alcohol when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the High Court candidate taught him genitals at a party while studying in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the web inventor is launching a new company that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee's Solid Open Source Platform.
The Solid platform allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people can access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's hidden intention was to "dominate the world."
"We have to do it now," said the emerging company.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid platform technology to allow users to create their own "personal online data storage" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify. They're all available in one browser at a time.
What is excluded from the personal online data store is that the user decides who can access certain information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data."
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company's CEO John Bruce, is that the company integrates resources, processes and skills that are suitable for the Solid platform to be available to everyone.
The company is currently formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, some developers in templates hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer encoders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications through the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that none of his team is talking to "Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a radical change where all business models are completely empty during the night.
"We're not asking for permission."
In a Saturday publication at the Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that "the Inrupt mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new integrated web on the Solid platform."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the Clergy of the I GM Victory Cross · Global Voices
The only cleric in the Church of England who won a Victory Cross during World War I as a fighter was honoured in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann obtained the guard on September 29, 1918 for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was shot down by a sniper four days later and never knew he had won the most important British military honor.
His two grandsons uncovered a memorial tombstone on a Saturday parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "magnificently symbolic" that the tombstone appeared exactly 100 years after his grandfather's voracious prowess.
According to The London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion on the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a very thick fog and under intense fire of cannons and machine guns."
Later he ran into the line of fire and, with the "maximum courage" made the row advance before throwing himself over a cannon with one hand and leaving three members of the detachment astonished.
Lieutenant Colonel was shot by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann (72) said that his grandfather's actions were a feat that could never equal, which gives you a sense of humility.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also left a crown after the parade, directed by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt very honored to be part of the parade and added that the value of a real hero is shown by the support he will receive from many people.
The MMA fans who went to sleep all night to see Bellator 206, saw Peppa Pig instead.
Imagine you're up all night to see Bellator 206 and you're denied the most important event.
The San José poster contained 13 fights, including six of the main card, and they had to see each other live all night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the match, the spectators of the United Kingdom were amazed when the programming changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were upset because they had spent the night awake until the morning to see the fight.
One follower on Twitter described the change in cartoons as "a kind of vomiting joke."
"Government regulations say that at 6:00 this content is inappropriate, so they changed to child programming," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's Vice President of Marketing and Communication, when asked about retransmission.
"Peppa the piggy, yes."
Bellator's president, Scott Coker, said they'd work on programming to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think when I think of repetition, I think it can work," said Coker.
"But there's six o'clock in the morning on a Sunday and we won't be able to resolve it until Sunday at our time, Monday at yours.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when I switched channels, there were a lot of messages coming and going, and they weren't all nice.
We were trying to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen again.
We'll leave it in five fights, instead of six as we normally do, we tried to show it again for the followers, but it's over.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "low" about sexuality
The Olympic jumper Tom Daley claims to have grown up feeling inferior to the rest of the people because of their sexuality, but that gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old sportsman said he didn't notice until he went to high school that not everyone was like him.
In the program Desert Island Discs of Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give "hope" to other people.
He also said that being a father had little interest in winning the Olympics.
The usual presenter of the long-term program, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off for illness.
Daley, who appeared as a shipwreck at Laverne's first program, said he felt "less than" the others because "he was not socially acceptable like children."
He said, "Today those feelings of inferiority and difference have been real things that have given me power and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, not to disappoint anyone when he ended up discovering his sexuality.
The two-time winner of the Olympic bronze medal has become a high profile promoter of the LGBT movement and has used its image the Commonwealth Games of this year in Australia to ask other countries to describe homosexuality.
He said he had spoken because he felt fortunate to be able to live openly without ramifications and that he wanted to give "hope" to others.
The world trichamp explained that he had fallen in love with a man, American director Dustin Lance Black, who met him in 2013, "took me by surprise."
Last year, Daley married the winner of an Oscar, 20 bigger than him, but says the age difference was never a problem.
According to him, when you pass by when you're young (he participated in his first Olympic Games when he was 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find someone of the same age who has experienced similar heights and lows.
The couple were parents in June of a child named Robert Ray Black-Daley, according to Daley, "her whole outlook" has changed.
"If you'd asked me last year, all I needed was to win an Olympic gold," he said.
"There are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
Her son calls himself his father, Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40 because of brain cancer.
According to Daley, his father did not accept his death and one of the last things he asked for was whether they already had tickets to London 2012 because he wanted to be in the front line.
"I couldn't tell her 'pare, you won't be there to occupy the first row," he said.
"As I held her hand, she stopped breathing and wasn't until then, she was already dead, which I finally accepted was not invincible," she said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew that was what I had dreamed my whole life: jumping in front of a crowd at home in an Olympics. There was no better feeling," he declared.
He also inspired the choice of his first song (Proud of Heather Small), which he had listened to during the preparation for the Olympics and which he still wore his hen skin.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Worse Mickelson showed up at Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will beat a record on Sunday in playing his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he'll have to change his physical state if he doesn't want to turn into an unhappy tape.
Mickelson, who will take part in the biennial event to record a 12th time, was introduced by Captain Jim Furyk for the "fourballs" and "foursomes" modalities of Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of action, as has usually been the case in the United States, the winner of five main tournaments spends his time between cheering and working on his game in the field, hoping to rectify what hurts him.
He never made the drivers more direct, not even at the moment of his career, but the 48-year-old player is not the ideal option for the difficult Le Golf National trajectory, where the long rush usually punishes the deflected blows.
And if his own career is not discouraging enough, Mickelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, will face the precise British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined Rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win the four matches this week.
If Americans, four points down at the beginning of the 12 individual games, start strong, Mickelson's party could become absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in this man, without being able to say much more.
"He perfectly understood his role for that day, he slapped me in the back and turned me around with his arm as he told me he would be ready the next day," Furyk said.
"I have a lot of confidence in myself.
It's a hall of fame and has contributed a lot to these teams earlier and this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing two games.
I imagined it more, but that's how I trained, and that's how we thought we should advance.
He wants to be there, like any other."
Sunday, Mickelson will be outnumbering Nick Faldo's record of the maximum number of Ryder Cup games played.
It can mean the end of a race at the Ryder Cup that hasn't matched its individual record.
Mickelson has won 18 victories, 20 defeats and 7 draws, although Furyk has claimed that his presence has contributed intangibles to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, joking, he likes to make fun of people and he's a great teammate," he said.
"I think younger players also had fun getting in with him this week, which was fun to see.
He adds much more besides his game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the advantage can quickly fade away
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that starting with a considerable advantage the individual duels of Ryder Cup's last day can easily become a hard day.
The Danish debuted in 1997 in Valderrama, when the team captained by Seven Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the American team, but eventually won the victory for the minimum of 14.5-13.5.
"You keep remembering that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but little by little," said Bjorn, on the picture, after seeing the 2018 team win for 5-3 Friday as much as yesterday, leaving the score on 10-6 in Le Golf National.
The story has taught me and all the team members that are not yet finished.
You have to go to every machine tomorrow.
You have to get out and do everything right.
This doesn't end until the dots aren't up on the marker.
We have a goal, try to win the trophy, and we have to keep the concentration to do it.
I said, I focus on the 12 players we have on the team, but I also remember who our rivals are: the best players in the world."
Delighted at the performance of their players in a demanding golf course, Bjorn added: "I will never rush with this.
Tomorrow will be different.
Tomorrow the individual performance will make a difference and change everything.
It's great to be with a partner when it's all right, but individual duels test your ability to play golf as much as possible.
This is the message you have to convey to the players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Right now, you leave your partner and he has to get out and get the best of himself as well."
In opposition to Bjorn, rival captain Jim Furyk, hopes his players will make it better individually than on the team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points of four.
Furyk knows both sides of the coin about the last day's ride, as he was part of Brookline's winning team before he ended up losing in the "Miracle of Medina" that won Europe.
"I remember exactly all the words," answered the question about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, motivated his players before the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important games, but we want to start with good feet, as was seen in Brookline and Medina.
When there's a team that's inspired, there's a lot of pressure in these central duels.
We have prepared alignment according to the circumstances and the best way to try to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas has the challenge of trying to start the rally against Rory McIllroy in the main duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Pollter as the rest of Europeans in the first half of the order.
"I've chosen this order because I think it covers all possibilities," Bjorn says about his selection for individual confrontations.
Germany's new warship, postponed again
The German army's new frigate should have ended in 2014 to replace the old warships of the Cold War era, but it won't, at least, until next year due to defective systems and an increase in cost, according to local media.
The completion of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the new Baden-Württemberg frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper, which quotes a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the Army in 2014, but the problems after construction have marked the terms of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg class ships entrusted by the Army in 2007 will replace the old frigates of the Bremen class.
It is believed that it will include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-ships missiles, as well as technology against theft, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other outstanding features include longer periods of maintenance: it should be possible to use fresh frigates up to two years without going through national ports.
However, these continuous delays imply that state-of-the-art ships, which were expected to be able to design Germany as a powerful foreign force, will already be obsolete when they get into operation, according to Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate was already known last year when the German Army rejected the ship and returned it to Drassass Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Army returned a ship to the builder once delivered.
Few details are known of the reasons why he returned, but the German media have cited several "material and technical defects" of the ship that made him unusable if used in combat missions.
Technical problems are important, since approximately 120 sailors, half of the crew needed for old Bremen-class frigates, operate on Baden-Württemberg-class ships.
In addition, it has also been known that the weight of the ship is excessive, which reduces its performance and limits the army's ability to add future improvements to it.
It is believed that the 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" will weigh twice as much as similar class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
Apart from defective materials, the cost of the project, which includes crew training, also begins to pose a problem.
It is believed that it has reached some amazing 3,100 million euros (3,600 million dollars) from an initial budget of 2,2 billion euros.
The problems of the new frigates have become a matter of special importance, taking into account recent warnings indicating that Germany's maritime military power is weakening.
This year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament Defence Committee, has acknowledged that the Army "is running out of ships that can be used."
The officer has claimed that the situation has worsened over time because old ships were no longer used, but none was provided as a replacement.
He regretted that none of the frigates in the Baden-Württemberg class could join the Army.
National Foundation spies on the secret life of bats
A new research carried out on a farm in the Highlands of Scotland aims to discover how bats use the landscape to feed themselves.
Discoveries are expected to provide new data on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help in future conservation activities.
The study of scientists from the National Foundation of Scotland will continue with soprano and common bats, in addition to Northern Ears and Water bats in the Botanical Garden of Inverewe, located in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations of the property to track the activities of bats during the station.
Volunteers and staff of the United Kingdom National Health Service will also carry out mobile surveys with portable detectors.
An analysis of the sound of recordings by experts will determine the sound frequency of bats and what each species does.
With this information, a report and a map of habitat will be created to create a detailed picture on the scale of the landscape of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, Natural Conservation Advisor to the National Foundation of Scotland, expects results to show which areas of habitat are more important to bats and how they are used by every species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of grasslands, and how to improve the maintenance of forests for bats and other associated species.
The bat population in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom has declined considerably in the last century.
Building construction and restoration tasks threaten bats, as they affect nests and can cause loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and light turbines also pose a risk, as do matamos paper and chemical treatments used in building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Actually, bats are not blind.
However, because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when they have to catch a prey.
They use a sophisticated echo tracking technique to place insects and obstacles in their flight.
The National Foundation of Scotland, responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes bats very seriously.
He's got ten experts with proper training, doing surveys, nest inspections, and sometimes regular rescues.
Even the organization has created the first and only reserve of Scotland dedicated to bats on the Three Estate farm, located in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species of bats in Scotland.
Farm administrator David Thompson says it's the ideal territory for the species.
"Here, in Three, we have a big bat area," he says.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and quite a good habitat.
But we still do not know many aspects of bats, so the work we do here and other properties will help us better understand what they need to grow."
It stresses the importance of checking whether there are bats before carrying out property maintenance tasks, since the possible involuntary destruction of a single mother nest kills more than 400 females and young people, which could result in the disappearance of a whole local population.
Rats are protected and it's illegal to kill them, attack them, disturb them and destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an official of the Scottish Rat Conservation Foundation, has encouraged people to take a step forward to help.
He said, "We still need to learn a lot about bats and, in the case of some of our species, we don't have enough data about their population."
Ronaldo denies the charges of rape while his lawyers prepare a lawsuit against a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has indicated that the accusations of rape against him are "false news" and has stated that people "want to become famous" thanks to his name.
His lawyers will sue the German weekly magazine Der Spiegel, responsible for publishing the charges.
Portugal's front and youth have been accused of violating an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Presumably, he paid $375,000 in time for the incident not to be made public, according to information published Friday by Der Spiegel.
In a video of Instagram Live which addressed its 142 million followers hours after the accusations were made public, Ronaldo, aged 33, claimed that they were "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news," says the Gold Pilot's five-time winner in the camera.
"They want to become famous thanks to my name.
It's normal.
They want to take advantage of my name to become famous, but it's part of my job.
I'm a happy man and everything's in order," the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are already preparing the lawsuit against Der Spiegel for the charges, which have been described as "inadmissible information of suspicions about privacy", according to Reuters.
Advocate Christian Schertz has stated that the player will seek compensation for "moral damages for an amount corresponding to the gravity of the offence, which is probably one of the most flagrant violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a hotel suite and casino Palms in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga returned to the player's room, where they allegedly raped her anally, according to reports filed at Clark County County Court, Nevada.
Major says Ronaldo got on his knees after the alleged incident and told him he was a "99% good boy," except a "1%".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that both of them had sexual intercourse, but they were consented.
Major also claims that he went to the police and took photographs of the injuries in the hospital, but later he accepted an agreement outside the courts because he was "fear of reprisals" and worried "to be publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old woman says she's trying to cancel the agreement, as she's still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to see the Royal Madrid coming from Manchester United at the time of the alleged incident and this summer he was looking for Juve, the Italian giant, in an operation of EUR 100 million.
Brexit: The United Kingdom "would always regret losing car manufacturers"
The United Kingdom would "always regret it," if you lost the state of world leader in manufacturing after Brexit, according to Greg Clark, Secretary of Economic Affairs.
He added that it was "concerning" that the Toyota base in the United Kingdom had told the BBC that if the United Kingdom left the European Union without any agreement, it would temporarily stop production at Burnaston factory near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer has indicated that the impact of delays on borders in the event of an uncoordinated Brexit could cause job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures the Auris and Avensis models in Toyota, produced 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if the United Kingdom leaves the EU without agreement at the end of March, production will stop at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Leaving the EU without any agreement on how trade with other EU countries will work has aroused the fears of other UK car manufacturers, such as Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close the Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what manufacturers consider risks in the production chain in the case of Brexit without agreement.
Toyota's production line takes place on a "just in time" basis, with pieces reaching every 37 minutes of suppliers from the United Kingdom and the European Union for the manufacture of automobiles.
If the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without agreement on 29 March, there may be disturbances at the border, which the sector believes could generate delays and shortages of fish.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep inventory for more than a day on the Derbyshire plant, according to the company, and production should be stopped as a consequence.
Clark claims that Theresa May's chequer plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid these border controls."
"We need to reach an agreement, we want to get the best agreement that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The tests not only of Toyota, but also of other manufacturers, indicate that we need to be able to continue with a successful set of production chains."
Toyota has not been able to confirm how long production would stop, but in the long run, he has warned that the added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and could cause the loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvalaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the coordinator of the United Union on the plant, has said that members are beginning to be very concerned about the situation: "By experience, when these jobs are lost, they never return."
A government spokesman said: "We have designed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
According to the White House, the meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be delayed again.
Donald Trump's expected meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could "pose a week" while continuing the struggle over the Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, in statements by the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in elections, links between Russia and aid to Trump and a possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump fired the deputy Attorney General and put Mueller's independence at risk, he's been feeding rumors in Washington for months.
This month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of carrying a microphone to record talks with Trump and also the possibility of filing the president with the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last Monday he went to the White House in rumors he was about to resign.
On Thursday, however, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he'd rather not say goodbye to Rosenstein, but postponed the meeting to avoid a confrontation with the Senate's judicial committee to which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate-wide vote.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he replied: "You haven't set a date yet, it could be this week, although it may be one more week for all matters with the supreme court.
But we'll see, I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists might refute this statement: Sanders has not held a White House briefing since September 10.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the lack of information sessions was not because he didn't like the bragging of television journalists, although he said, "I won't deny they're bragging."
Then he suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased.
"The president does more questions and answers than any previous president," he said, before adding the following without quoting any sources: "We have consulted this data."
Sanders has stated that the briefings will continue to take place, but "if the press has the possibility to ask the President of the United States directly, it's infinitely better than talking to me.
We try to do this often, you've seen us do a lot in the past few weeks and they'll replace the briefings when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press wheels with dignitaries on official visit.
Individual press wheels are uncommon.
This week, in New York, the president may have demonstrated why, after an informal appearance and, at some point, strange to the journalists gathered.
The Health Secretary writes to the EU workers of the Scottish National Health Service on the basis of fears for Brexit
The Health Secretary has written to EU staff working in the Scottish National Health Service to express the country's gratitude and wishes them to continue after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months after leaving the United Kingdom.
The Scottish government has already pledged to cover the cost of state of residence applications for EU citizens working in delegated public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on exit have continued, and everything seems to be directed towards the decisions expected this fall.
But the UK government has also begun preparations for a possible stage without agreement.
I know it's convulsive times for all of you.
So I would like to reiterate now that I greatly appreciate the contribution of all staff, regardless of their nationality.
EU partners, and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, while benefiting the patients and communities we deal with.
Of course, Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes an emergency operation after having suffered a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, re-reliance of the Tennessee State Tigers, has undergone an emergency surgery after having suffered a head injury on Saturday in the defeat of 31-27 against the Vanderbilt Commodores, according to information from Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed reported to the press that the injury occurred shortly before half.
"He came to the sideline and collapsed there," said Reed.
Coaches and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen to the band before placing him in a bunker and taking him to do more testing.
A Tennessee State officer reported to Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had left surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there's still no information about the type or extent of the injury" and Tennessee State is investigating when the injury occurred.
It's the first season in Abercrombie, second year, with Tennessee State after it came from Illinois.
I had completed five plaques on Saturday before leaving the game, making a total of 18 this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp tax when buying a property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp tax when buying a property in the United Kingdom with the additional money used to help homeless people according to the new Conservative Party's plans.
This action will neutralize Corbyn's success in attracting young voters.
The increase in the stamp tax will be recorded in those people who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
The facility expects to earn up to 120 million pounds annually to help homeless people.
Foreign buyers are expected to have a higher stamp tax on buying a property in the United Kingdom and this money will be used to help homeless people, a measure that Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's movement to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing that would affect higher incomes.
The increase in the stamp tax will be recorded in those people and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom; this money will be used for government action to combat the numbers of homeless people.
The overload, which will be added to the current stamp tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago in second residences and real estate speculation, could be up to 3%.
The estate expects to get up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13% of London's new construction properties are non-British residents, which increase prices and make it difficult for new buyers to open up on the property scale.
Many wealthy areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "phantom cities" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new measure comes weeks after Boris Johnson has requested a reduction in the stamp tax to help young people get their first home.
He accused the large buildings of keeping the property prices high by buying land quickly and not using it, and urged May to cancel the quotas on affordable homes to correct Britain's real estate disaster.
Corbyn has announced a series of attractive proposed real estate reforms, such as controls on rent and termination of "no blame" evictions.
He also wants to give more power to the assemblies to build new homes.
May said: "Last year I said I would devote my mandate to restoring the British dream: life must improve for every new generation.
And that means correcting our broken real estate market.
Britain will always be open to everyone who wants to live, work, and create a life here.
However, it can't be right that it's as easy for people who don't live in the United Kingdom as it is for foreign companies to buy housing compared to British people who work hard.
For too many people, the dream of having a home on property is too distant and the indignation of the homeless makes it all more real."
Jack Ross: "My greatest ambition is to train Scotland."
Sunderland coach Jack Ross has claimed that his "maximum ambition" is to be Scottish coach at some point.
The 42-year-old Scottish accepted the challenge of reviving the North-East Club, which currently occupies the third position in the League One, at three points of the leader.
He arrived at Stadium of Light this summer after returning St Mirren to Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
I was summoned once as a supporter and that's all," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound program.
"But I grew up seeing much playing Scotland in Hampden with my father when I was little and always is something that makes me fall back in time.
This opportunity will only come to me if I succeed in training clubs, but."
Ross' predecessors in Sunderland coaching include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Alloa Athletic's coach claims that he doesn't feel the pressure to be next on a list of names consecrated on such a large team, after having previously rejected Barnsley and Ipswich Town offers.
"For now, my criteria for measuring my success will be if I can get this team back to the Premier League.
With the club's structure and facilities, it's obvious its place is the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd only consider that I've been successful here if I can get the club back."
Ross only has three years of experience as a coach, after a period as a second coach in Dumbarton and 15 months in the technical body of Hearts.
He helped Alloa avoid falling into the third category and turned St. Mirren into fighting for salvation into Champions of the Championship the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than during his stage as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"Probably it was a turning point," he recalled about accepting Alloa's position.
"I had always believed that training was what I was given best, rather than playing.
It sounds strange because I did it well, I got out reasonably and enjoyed quite a few moments.
But playing can be very hard.
There's a lot you have to overcome every week.
I'm still doing it in aspects like stress and pressure at work, but I feel good as a coach.
I've always wanted to train and now I'm doing it, it's the time that I've felt the most comfortable since I was an adult."

The perfect time for a look is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday, according to a study.
The summer heat wave has fired consumption at Britain's tough bars, but has added more pressure to restaurant chains.
Bars and bar chains have increased by 2.7% in sales in July, but consumption in restaurants has declined by 4.8%, according to statistics.
Peter Martin, from CGA's financial advice, the company that collected the data, says: "The continuous hours of sunshine and the participation of England in the World, which has expanded more than expected, have led to a similar pattern in July, with the increase of 2.8 percent in bars, except in the case of restaurants, which have suffered even more.
The decline of 1.8 percent in consumption in June restaurants has worsened in July.
The bars and taverns, led by drinking, have achieved the best results, while the consumption in restaurants has gone down.
The bars that offer food have also suffered with the sun, although it has not been as dramatic as in the case of restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and drink.
In the bars and taverns we consulted, drinking sales increased by 6.6% during the month, while food sales decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman, from the U.S. analysts and hotel stores, said: "These results continue the trend we see since the end of April.
The time and impact of major social or sporting events continue to be the main factors related to sales of the external market.
It is no surprise that restaurants continue to have problems, but a decrease in sales by 4.8% annually would be particularly detrimental, more than continuing pressure on costs.
This long and warm summer could not have come at a worse time for the food-service trades and time will tell if the most moderate temperatures we had in August will provide this much needed breath."
The total increase in bar and restaurant sales, including those recently opened, has been 2.7% in July, as it indicates the slowdown in the presentation of brands.
The sales indicator of The Coffer Peach Tracker for UK restaurants, bars and taverns collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined loss of more than 9 million pounds and is the established reference point for the sector.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that hide their parents
One in five children, some in 11 years, have secret social media accounts that hide parents and teachers, according to data from a survey.
A survey of 20,000 high school students indicated an increase in the "false Insta" pages.
News has raised fears about sexual content publication
20% of students say they have a "principal" account that shows parents
One in five children, some 11 years old, believe social media accounts that hide adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students indicated a rapid increase in "false Insta" accounts, a reference to Instagram, the place to share photos.
The news has raised fears about sexual content.
About 20% of students say they have a clean "principal" account that they show their parents, while they also have a private account.
A mother who discovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret account saw a message from a teenager in which she urged others to "violate me."
The research, carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the Committee of Directors of Independent Schools (HMC), has revealed that 40% of adolescents between 11 and 18 years of age have two profiles, half of which have admitted that they have private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: “It’s disturbing that many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be "the voices of athletes" in the directive of the Scottish athletic federation
Eilidh Doyle has been appointed non-executive director of the directive of the Scottish athletic federation at the annual general meeting of the organization.
Doyle is the field and track athlete with more Scottish medals, and President Ian Beattie described the movement as a great opportunity for those who guide the sport to benefit from their extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Eilyhidh has respect for Scotland's athletic community, the United Kingdom and all over the world, and we are confident that Scottish athletics will benefit from its incorporation into the directive," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I look forward to acting as an athlete's voice, and I hope I can make sport grow and contribute to Scotland."
The American, who won gold in the 200s and 400s at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, between a total of four Olympic bears and is currently the usual BBC commentator, was prevented from walking after a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors told me that only time will tell me if I can recover or how much.
It's been exhausting, but I've recovered completely, I've learned to walk again and today it's about doing agility exercises!
Thank you for the cheers!"
An ad of tiralets comparing mothers with cows divides opinion on the Internet
A retail company has divided their opinion on the Internet with an announcement that compares nursing mothers with cows who are riding.
To mark the launch of what is considered the "first silent shooter that can be brought from the world", the consumer technology company Elvie has issued an announcement inspired by a musical video of joke to show the freedom that the new shooter gives to mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a granary full of farts and cows at the rhythm of a song that includes letters like, "Yes, I'm punching myself, but you won't see any tails" and, "If you hadn't noticed, they're not brats, but my breasts."
The tour continues: "Bomb, fire, feed babies, pump, fire, punch girls."
However, the announcement, published on the company's Facebook page, has caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received a mix of reactions from the one who saw it, many of whom say it shows the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
"Very bad decision to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to milk, with the difference that they are separated from their babies a few days after they are born," wrote one person.
Elvie is discreetly hiding in a lactation bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another person commented: "Comprehensibly traumatic for mother and baby.
But why not use them to announce a shrapnel for mothers who will keep their babies?"
Another user added, "It's an out of place ad."
Other people defended the ad; one woman admitted that finding the song "fun."
"I think it's a great idea.
I'd buy one if I still had to breastfeed.
Blowing for the gun made me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad is a bit crazy, but it has to be taken as what it is.
It's a great product," wrote a user.
Another person commented: "It's a fun ad for mothers who fire with guns (usually at their place of work or in the washbasin and feel like cows.
It's not an ad that praises or judges the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, women show that they've all danced with the shrapnel quietly on the bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the perception that many women say they feel like cows when they use the shrapnel.
However, Elvie's shrapnel is completely silent, has no cable or tube and fits discreetly into a lactation bra, which gives women more freedom to move, hold babies and even go out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, mother's first-born partner and developer, said: "Elvie's t-shirt is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a daring and provocative campaign.
When we drew parallelism between women and cows, we wanted to show the public how a shrapnel is used and the challenges that it entails, while at the same time demonstrating, in an entertaining and didactic way, the incredible feeling of freedom offered by the new shrapnel.
It's not the first time that Elvie's cartoon is on the news.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children appeared on the gateway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of children emigrated quietly to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of children detained emigrants has increased even though monthly entries across the border have remained virtually stable, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump administration have made it difficult to sponsor children.
Traditionally, most fathers were undocumented immigrants, who have been afraid to put their chance to stay in the country if they decide to take a child.
The risk has increased in June, when federal authorities announced that the possible patrons and other adults living in their homes will have to send fingerprints, which will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs officer, testified in front of Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no previous criminal record.
"About 80% of the people who have received or live in the home of a person who has received them are illegally in the country, and a large majority of them are criminal foreigners.
So we're going to keep chasing these people," Albence declared.
To prosecute the children more quickly, officers have introduced new rules that require some to file for trial within a month after being held, instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to refugee workers.
Many of them will appear by videoconferencing, rather than by presence, to defend their case in order to obtain legal status before an immigration judge.
All those who are not considered fit for help will be deported immediately.
The longer children spend time in custody, the more likely they will be to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can generate violent ramps or attempts to escape, according to the workers and reports they have given to the system in recent months.
Lawyers claim that these concerns can intensify in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where it is more likely that, due to their size, signs indicating that a child is suffering will be overlooked.
They added that moving children to the camp without having time to prepare them emotionally or say goodbye to friends can cause them a trauma that they already suffer.
Syria urges the "occupational forces" of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem asked Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country has been going on for eight years.
Muallem, who also acts as Deputy Prime Minister, has stated that foreign forces were illegally on Syrian territory, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and "the matter will be dealt with accordingly."
"You must retreat immediately and unconditionally," he said to the assembly.
Muallem has insisted that the "war of terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and the conflict has caused millions of displaced persons.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we have purged the entire Syrian territory" of both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2000 troops in Syria, mainly to train and advise the Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the land of a war-affected country.
On the issue of refugees, Muallem has stated that the conditions were good for their return and has blamed "a few Western countries" for spreading "irrational causes" that make refugees want to stay away from them.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They're politicizing a matter that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid to reconstruction for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
United Nations diplomats have stated that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a neutral zone on the last major rebel stronghold, Idlib, has favored the opportunity to continue with political encounters.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has avoided a large-scale attack by Syrian forces with the help of Russia in the province, where three million people live.
However, Muallem has noted that the agreement has "clear terms" and has expressed the hope that military action will confront the jihadists, including Al-Nusra Front fighters, linked to Al-Qaeda, who "will be eradicated."
Staffan de Mistura, sent from the UN, expects soon to convene the first meetings of a new committee formed by members of the government and the opposition to begin profiling a post-war constitution and preparing the way for the elections.
Muallem exposed the conditions of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, whose task should be restricted to "revising the articles of the current constitution" and warned of possible interference.
Why Trump will win for the second time
According to this logic, Trump would win the election again in 2020 except that, as many liberal spectators probably expect, scandals and the removal process end with his presidency prematurely.
What would undoubtedly be "the end of a more dramatic presidency in history."
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue in the spectators.
Since 2014, the number of viewers in peak time has more than doubled to 1.05 million at the CNN and practically tripled to 1.6 million at the NBCMS.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in peak time, from 1.7 million years ago, according to Nielsen, and The Rachel Maddow Show, from the MNSBC, has led the cable television audiences with up to 3.5 million viewers on the main news nights.
"People have been exposed to it because they don't understand it," says Neal Baer, executive producer of the ABC series "Designed Survival," about a cabinet decree that becomes president when an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a former comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
Remember a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 election.
The cabman told him he'd vote Trump.
"Why?" he asked.
"He answered me that because he made him laugh," said Scovell.
There's a point of entertainment in chaos.
Of course, unlike television programs, the script coming out of Washington could determine Roe v. Wade's future if immigrant families could meet and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, being an informed citizen is going further when you're at six o'clock to see a group of experts discuss the use that Bob Woodward has made of sources "for private use" for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich jacket ("a thick piece of clothing like his pride," headlined the Washington Post) and the consequences of the horrifying descriptions that Stormy Daniels made of, say, Trump's anatomy.
In my case, I won't see Super Mario again.
"Part of what makes it seem to be part of a telereality program is that every night it gives you something new," says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars" about the changes of characters and cartoons of Trump's program (playing with NFL, commending Kim Jong-Un).
You can't afford to miss any episodes because you stay behind.
When I saw Fleiss this week, there was a temperature of about 25 degrees and she was alone outside the house on the north coast of Kauai, but she was locked up looking at the MSNBC while recording the CNN.
You couldn't get rid of it, not with Brett Kavanaugh about to face the Senate judicial committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging from a thread.
"I remember when we did those crazy shows then and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it would be kind of a joke, but they seemed right."

Foreign money floods the elections of half-legislature elections in the House of Adjusted Representatives
It is no surprise that there is a flood of cash in the 17th District of Pennsylvania, thanks to the realignment of the Congressional Districts that has led two current members to compete in the same square.
This recent reassignment from Pittsburg's suburban district involves Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who obtained the square in another district after a special election last spring.
Lamb faces another current representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which conflicts with the new 17th district.
The maps were redesigned after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decreed in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally divided in favour of the Republicans.
The race for the new 17th district has triggered a financial war between the main financial organizations of the parties, the Democratic Congress Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb made a name for Pennsylvania after a victory adjusted in a very followed special election held in March to represent the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
Republicans have been in charge for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district for 20 different points.
Political experts give Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States impose sanctions on Salvador for its support in China, but withdraw them
Diplomats observed that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Trump held a tense meeting with the president of Panama, Juan Carlos Valera, in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his partners expelled the Trump Organization management team.
State Department officials decided to withdraw the heads of the US diplomatic missions to Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama for the "recent decisions on the failure to recognize Taiwan," declared Heather Nauert, spokesman for the department this month.
However, only the possibility of sanctioning El Salvador, which received aid from the United States in 2017 from 140 million dollars, according to estimates, for drug trafficking control, development and economic improvements, was contemplated.
The proposed sanctions, which include cuts in financial aid and restrictions on visas issued, would be detrimental to the Central American country and the high numbers of deaths due to murder and unemployment.
With the passage of internal meetings, officials from both countries postponed a high-level meeting focused on security and economic prosperity to continue with a similar meeting held last year and which was seen as a step forward to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior government officials clarified that they wanted the meeting to take place, which effectively ended up with any likelihood of sanctions for the Salvadoran.
Vice President Mike Pence has been chosen for the meeting, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to it, according to diplomats.
The three U.S. envoys discreetly returned to their posts in Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
A spokesman for the Bolton White House refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three officers, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal deliberations since the anonymous.
An outside analyst, close to the administration and also since the anonymous, has corroborated their statements.
Study history
The next event to occur could be the report of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller on Trump's possible obstruction of justice, of which there is numerous evidence in public records.
From what is known, Mueller also investigates whether Trump's campaign collaborated with Russia in its election attack.
If Congress changes hands, Trump could find himself accountable to the organization, just when he's prepared to do so in front of voters, and even before a jury of party members.
There are many circumstantial conditions, and I do not want to suggest that the fall of Trump, nor any of its European counterparts, is inevitable.
There are decisions to be made on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the situation will last.
In 1938, German officials were prepared to take a coup against Hitler only if the Western bloc had resisted him and supported the Checoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid all the years of terror that followed.
The course of history fluctuates over points of inflection like this and accelerates or weakens the inexorable progress of democracy.
The United States is currently facing a number of inflection points.
What if Trump fired Rod Rosenstein, Deputy Attorney General, the man who controls the fate of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been with water in his neck since this newspaper reported that last year he suggested secretly recording the president and speculated that he was inappropriate for the position.
Rosenstein claims the Times information isn't accurate.
"How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the FBI about Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if it is confirmed for the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and false witnesses?
And, especially, are we going to vote in half the legislature for a Congress that will hold Trump responsible for this?
If we do not overcome these trials, democracy will begin to be in danger.
But I think we're not going to fail, because I've already learned the lesson in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that occupied the ambassador's house.
He survived, emigrated to the United States, and 60 years later, he sent me to light Saturday candles at that table with swastika.
With this baggage, how can I not be optimistic about the future?"

Graham Dorrans, from Rangers, party-optimist against the Vienna Rapid
The Rangers receives the Vienna Rapid Thursday, aware that a victory against the Austrians, after an impressive four in the real Vila-Real field this month, would leave him in a good position to qualify for the G Group of the League Europe.
A knee injury prevented half-fielder Graham Dorrans from playing the first minutes of the season up to square 2-2 against the Real Village, but he believes Rangers can use this as a trampoline for great results.
"It was a positive point for us, because the Real Village is a good team," said the 31-year-old player.
"We played the party believing that we could get a valuable result and we got out with a point.
Maybe we could have pulled something else at the end, but in general, the empathy was probably a fair result.
They were better in the first part, but we were better than them in the second.
On Thursday, it's another great European night.
We hope we can stay with the three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they made a good result in the last game, but I'm sure we'll do everything and we'll get a good result with the support of the hobby.
Last year it was really rough, with the injuries I suffered and the changes in the club, but now it's a good place to be.
The team is fine and the boys enjoy it, the training is good.
I hope we can give it all up, leave behind last season and succeed."
Women lose sleep out of fear of retirement savings
Although the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people talked about it with the family.
Approximately half of national surveys state that they have talked to their partner about the long-term cost of attention.
Only 10% of the respondents say they talked to their children.
"People want some family members to look after them, but they don't dare think about it," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the nationwide life insurance company.
We need to start here.
Talk to your mate and children about how you can make sure that your family does not communicate your wishes in advance.
He works with your advisor and your family to decide where and how to get attention, as these decisions can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
It includes your financial advisor in the conversation: it can also help you determine how to pay these expenses.
Your funding options for your long-term care may include a long-term long-term health insurance policy, an effective hybrid life insurance policy that helps you cover your own expenses or insurance with your own resources, if you have the money you need to do it.
Prepare your legal papers: cut the passage into legal battles.
He's looking for a representative so he can appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical attention and make sure professionals meet your wishes in case you can't communicate.
Consider also the possibility of hiring a notary takeover for your finances.
It is appropriate to select a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and to ensure that your bills are paid in case of incapacity.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that your old relative has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Specify these details in a written plan to be prepared.
Finance is not the only factor that must be determined, but also which doctors to deal with," Martin said.
"What are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Have this plan ready."
Man shot several times with a compressed air rifle in Ilfracombe
One man received several shots from a compressed air gun while he was returning home after leaving at night.
The victim, about 40 years old, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
The officers described the shooting, which took place around 2.30 a.m. (in the British summer hours) as a random act.
The victim hasn't seen his attacker.
His life is not in danger from injuries, and the police have called for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died because of a severe earthquake and tsunami that shook the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to the authorities, it is hoped that the number of deaths will increase.
Since the communications are cut off, the relief units have not been able to obtain information from the Donggala regency, an area north of Palu nearest to the 7.5 magnitude earthquake epicenter.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Below are some important data on Palu and Donggala, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Celebes, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Celebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when an earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency that stretches along more than 300 km of coast to the northwest of the island of Celebes.
The regency, an administrative region below a province, had a population of approximately 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of the province of Central Celebes, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
The exploitation of nickel mines is also important in the province, but it focuses mainly on Morowali on the coast of the other extreme of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have suffered several tsunamis in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian disaster mitigation agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996 there was also a tsunami in the west of Donggala that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific's firebelt, and there are often earthquakes there.
The main earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years are listed below:
2004: On December 26, a major earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Ace, north of Sumatra, caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Thousands died on Nias Island on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck southern Java, the most populated island in Indonesia, and caused a tsunami that devastated the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake measuring 7.6 magnitude shook a pop area of the city of Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake measuring 7.5 struck one of the islands of Mentawai on the coast of Sumatra, resulting in a tsunami of up to 30 feet [10 m] that devastated dozens of villages and killed some 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya regime in Aceh and caused destruction and panic, as the population recalled the devastation of the earthquake and the 2004 tsunami.
This time, there were no tsunamis, but more than 100 died as a result of falling buildings.
2018: A series of major earthquakes took place on the touristic island of Lombok, which killed more than 500 people, mainly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily trapped.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of aggression.
Palin, aged 29, wasilla's natural, Alaska, was arrested as a suspect of domestic violence, interference with a report of domestic violence and arrest resistance, according to a report published on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a known person tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he pulled his phone.
Palin is under arrest at the Mat-Su interim detention centre, where he is held under a bond with no guarantee of USD 500, according to KTU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, when he declared himself "not guilty, surely" when he was asked how he declared himself, according to this chain.
Palin faces three Class A failures, which means he could go to prison for up to a year and have to pay a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also accused of a lack of class B, which can be punished with one day in prison and $2,000 in fines.
This is not the first time that criminal charges against Palin have been filed.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to notify the alleged attack.
The case is currently in the hands of the Alaskan Veterinary Court.
In January 2016 he was accused of domestic aggression, interference with the report of a domestic violence crime and possession of a weapon in a state of drunkenness in connection with the incident.
Her partner said that she had punched him in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans to associate her son's violent behavior with a post-traumatic stress disorder derived from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after an earthquake shook the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The 7.5 - magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and devastated thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks don't work and the number of deaths is expected to increase over the next few days.
The earthquake occurred just off the coast of Central Celebes, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
On social media, videos are circulating at the time of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami arrived on the coast.
Federal Prosecutors are calling for an exceptional death penalty for a New York terrorist attack suspect
New York federal prosecutors are calling for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the New York terrorist attack who killed eight people: an extraordinary penalty that has not been applied to the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30-year-old, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike lane on the West Side Highway, on Lower Manhattan and ride roaders and cyclists during his trip in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must demonstrate that Saipov killed the eight victims "intentionally" and that "intentionally" caused serious personal injury, according to the notice of intent to apply for the death penalty presented in the Southern District of New York.
Both crimes could be a death penalty, according to the court's document.
Weeks after the attack, a large federal juror attacked Saipov with a 22 missing indictment that included eight charges of murder for organized crime, which federal prosecutors usually use in cases of mafia, in addition to a crime of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The prosecutors claimed that the attack required a "significant planning and premeditation" and described Saipov's way of acting as "inhuman, cruel and depraved."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused wounds, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," according to the notice of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last time the Southern District of New York brought a death penalty case to trial.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug traffickers, but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was executed in a federal case in New York was 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted of conspiracy to carry out spying actions for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs died in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, native to Uzbekistan, did not show repentance in the days and months after the attack.
The police said that he told the researchers that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
According to the police, he also asked for the ISIS flag to be displayed in his hospital room.
He was found not guilty of the 22 missing charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, claimed that they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We consider that the decision to apply for the death penalty, instead of accepting a conviction and a life sentence without the possibility of freedom, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all the people involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to apply for the death penalty.
Member of parliament of the Conservative Party states that NIGEL FARAGE should be placed in charge of the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize popular troops" today during a protest at the Conservative party conference.
UKIP's previous leader has stated that politicians must "feel pressure from Eurosceptics" when one of the own members of Theresa May's parliament has suggested that it should lead negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MEP Peter Bone told Birmingham that the United Kingdom would already be outside the EU if Mr Farage was the Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge faced by Mrs. May in reconciling her deeply divided ranks has been highlighted when conservatives in favour of union have presented themselves in another protest against Brexit in La City.
The Prime Minister is struggling to maintain his Chequers commitment plan between the attacks of Brexit supporters, Union supporters and the EU.
Allies insist that it will reach an agreement with Brussels despite negative responses and pressure Eurosceptics and the conservative party to choose between their package and chaos.
Mr. Bone told the Leave Means Leave meeting in Solihull that he wanted to undo the Czechers' engagement.
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been appointed as a member of the House of Lords and that he should have been given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
'If he'd been in charge, we'd be out by now,' he said.
Parliament member Wellingborough added: "I will defend Brexit, but we have to break the Czechers compromise."
To clarify his opposition to the EU, he added: "We did not fight world wars for service.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone rejected the suggestion that public opinion had changed since the vote in 2016: "The idea that the British population has changed their minds and wants to stay there is totally false."
Brexit Conservative Partywoman Andrea Jenkyns also attended the march and said to reporters, "I'm just telling you, Prime Minister, to listen to people."
"Chequers' commitment is unpopular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular within our party and our activists, who are the people who go out and get us to win an election.
Quit the Chequers engagement and start listening."
In a message addressed to Mrs. May, she added: "The prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage said the rally politicians must feel pressure if they want to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"That, now, is a matter of trust between us (people) and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and today we're here to tell them we won't allow it."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added, "I want you to make the political class, about to betray Brexit, feel the pressure."
"We are mobilizing the popular troops in this country that gave us victory with Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, supporters of the union marched to Birmingham before holding a two - hour rally in the city center.
A small number of activists waved banners over conservatives against Brexit after the group's launch this weekend.
The Conservative member of the House of Lords Lord Adonis was ridiculed by conservatives for the security issues they faced with an application of the party at the beginning of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have the necessary IT systems and all the technology for the Canada Agreement plus, for the border without friction, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a complete farce.
There is no option for a good Brexit," he added.
Warren intends to examine the possibility of becoming a presidential candidate
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she's going to look at the possibility of becoming a presidential candidate after the November election.
Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at an open meeting in the western part of Massachusetts.
Warren, President Donald Trump's usual criticism, is presented for his re-election in November against GOP state representative Geoff Diehl, who was deputy president of the Trump Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
It's been the centre of speculation about the possibility of taking over Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with constituents in the open assembly format since Trump took over.
An assistant asked him if he planned to run as a presidential candidate.
Warren said it's time for "women to go to Washington to repair our government that doesn't work, and that includes a woman in the dome."
A person arrested for the death of Sims, LSU
Baton Rouge police, La., announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested for the death of the basketball player at LSU Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge police department announced the 20-year-old arrest of Dyteon Simpson at the ET press conference at 11:00.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for collaboration to identify the man on the subway.
Sims, aged 20, was shot and died near the Southern University campus in the morning of Friday.
"Wayde Sims got shot in the head that finally killed him," said police officer Murphy J. Paul on Saturday in the media for 247sports.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and got shot from Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being on the scene, holding a gun, and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to custody in the East Baton district police department.
Sims, a 2 m junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 parts with 10 beginnings during the last season and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton gets the title of the world after the team's orders give him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas stood in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the orders of the Mercedes team would play an important role in the race.
From the pole position, Bottas had a good start and almost ran out of Hamilton while defending his position on the first two occasions and inviting Vettel to attack his partner.
Vettel went into boxes before and let Hamilton run with the traffic at the back of the package, which should have been decisive.
Later, Mercedes had to stop in boxes and went out behind Vettel, but Hamilton advanced after some wheeled action that caused the Ferrari pilot to abandon the free interior with the risk of staying out after a double movement to defend the third corridor.
Max Verstappen started in the last row of the grid and at the end of the first round he was in the seventh position on the day of his 21st birthday.
Then he continued in a good position most of the race, keeping his wheels to save time, moving on to Kimi Raikkonen and moving on to the fourth position.
He finally got into the boxes at round number 44, but couldn't raise his pace the next eight times and Raikkonen was placed in fourth position.
It's a difficult day, because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and he was a real lord who was told to let me pass.
The team did a great job of having an u-do," Hamilton said.
His body language was terrible.
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Dianne Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday to insist that she did not leak Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
At a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly of Ford's witness before the Senate Judicial Committee, but commented that what was going on in the Senate proved that people are "sick, cruel and lying."
"One thing that could happen and the most beautiful of what's going on in the last days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see angry, bad, cruel and lying people," he said.
"When you look at the communications and the leaks and say "No, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember his answer... did you leak the document? "Hey, what?
No, no.
I didn't leak it."
Hey, wait a minute.
We leaked... no, we didn't filter it," he added while imitating the senator.
Feinstein received the letter detailing the statements against Kavanaugh from Ford in July and leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's statements, I didn't leak her story," Feinstein told the Committee, according to The Hill.
"He asked me to be confidential and I kept it confidential, just as he asked me."
But his denial did not please the President, who commented at the meeting on Saturday night: "You know what, his body language was terrible.
Maybe he didn't, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing his defense of the High Court candidate, accused of improper sexual conduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the statements for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power by the necessary means.
You see evil, cruelty, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to strike for power and control," said the President, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars repaired the defeat of Friday in the elite against the Belfast Giants, as they won the game back 5 to 3 in Dundee Saturday.
The Giants quickly gained a two goal advantage thanks to the completions of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie went up the level of their team, but then Dwyer restored the Giants' advantage.
Francois Bouchard equaled the Dundee, then two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen ensured their victory.
It was the third defeat of the season at the Elite League for Adam Keefe's men, who had just won the Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday.
It was the fourth season meeting between the two teams and the Giants had won the previous three matches.
The first goal came from Dwyer's hand in the fourth minute, at 3:35, from Kendall McFaull's assistance. Four minutes later, with David Rutherford's assistance, Beauvillier would double his advantage.
During this troubled initial period, Sullivan repositioned the home team to the game in the minute 13:10 before Matt Marquardt facilitated the equalizer in the minute 15:16.
Dwyer guaranteed the advantage of the Giants in the first pause when he achieved the second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The local team regrouped and, again, Bouchard contributed to its level with a powerful goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the first lead during the match at the end of the second part and guaranteed the victory of his team with the fifth goal near the end of the game.
The Giants, who have already lost four of the last five games, are at home in Milton Keynes and have their next game on Friday.
An air controller dies to save hundreds of passengers from an earthquake plane
An air controller from Indonesia has become a hero after dying to make sure a plane with hundreds of passengers landed safely.
More than 800 people have died and many have disappeared after a major earthquake struck the island of Celebes on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
There are many replicas in the area and there are many people trapped between the ruins in the city of Palu.
But, despite their fellows escaping to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan grande refused to leave his place at the tremendous airport control tower at Palu Mutiaara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
She stayed in her place to make sure that flight Batik 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could safely take the flight.
Then he left the air traffic control tower when he thought he was sinking.
He died later in the hospital.
A representative of Air Navigation, Indonesia, Yohannes Siriat, said that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reports Australia's ABC News.
We set up a Balikpapan helicopter in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"That broke our hearts," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands, while the disaster relief agency has reported that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number of deaths is expected to increase because there are still many bodies under the rubble and there are still many that have not been accessed," said the representative of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The waves, with a height of up to six meters, devastated Palu, who will celebrate a common funeral on Sunday.
Armed forces and some commercial planes are carrying help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute, an ambulance carries corpses.
Drinking water is scarce.
All the minimercats have been looted."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross works against clocks to help survivors, but we don't know what they'll find.
This is already a tragedy, but it could still get worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the armed forces: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready?", CNN told.
Indonesia suffered another earthquake this year in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Aviation Accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says a man has disappeared after the accident in the lagoon
The airline operating a flight that is going to crash into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says a man has disappeared, although previously said that the 47 passengers and the crew had safely evacuated the plane that was sinking.
Air Niugini said in a statement that they had not found a passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The airline claimed to be working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to try to find him.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional details on the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and the crew when the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at the Chuuk Islands airport.
The authorities announced on Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said Saturday there were still six passengers in the hospital and they were all in good condition.
The reason for the accident and the exact sequence of events is still unknown.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy claimed that the plane docked at the lake because the runway was short.
Some witnesses think the plane missed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes explained that the plane was very low.
"That was extremely positive," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers managed to walk with water through the waist to the emergency exits of the plane, which was sinking.
He said that the flight attendants panicked and began shouting, and that he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that the sailors who had been working nearby to improve a dock also helped in the rescue with an inflatable boat to transport the affected people to the ground before the plane sank about 30 meters into the water.
Aviation Safety Network data indicate that 111 people died in aircraft accidents registered in PNG, but Air Niugini was not involved in any of these accidents.
An analyst composes a chronology of the night that was burned alive by a woman
The prosecution concluded the case on Saturday in the revision of the trial of a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness to the intelligence field.
He described to the jury how he used mobile phone records to build the movements of the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, the night he died.
Rowlett said he received location data from different mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night he died, which contradicted his earlier statements, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he claimed he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford denied it and testified that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in the Sanford van that night, Sanford said he had lied, since his truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
The phone records indicated they had only known each other for one week.
Rowlett said that, some time after Chambers died, Tellis deleted text messages, phone calls, and contact information from Chambers from his phone.
"He wiped it out of his life," said Hale.
The defense plans to initiate its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he was waiting for the jury to pass the trial on the same day.
The High Breed: What is the conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio fills his music with positive messages to challenge the negative view of the genre.
The High Breed, from Bristol, ensures that hip-hop has turned away from its origins with political messages and social problems.
They want to go back to their roots and put the conscious hip-hop back in fashion.
Some artists, such as The Fugees and Common, have experienced a recent resurgence in the United Kingdom by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
NY Mainadera demands a couple for farewell after a "racist" message
A New York nurse reported a couple for a discriminatory dismissal after receiving a text message from the mother who protested because she was "another black person."
The couple denies that they're racist and compare the demand to a "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed dismay that the new nurse, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work on the first day of 2016.
"Nooooooooooo one other black person," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending him to her husband, she sent him to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After realizing her pifia, a "uncomfortable" Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, claiming that the nurse who had fired, who was African-American, had done wrong her work and that she expected a Filipino person, according to the New York Post.
Maurice received the corresponding payment on her working day and was later sent home to work with a Uber.
Now, Maurice claims the couple's compensation for the dismissal and asks for compensation of approximately $350 a day for the six-month-old job for which she had been hired, although there was no contract.
"I want to show you that you can't do things like that," he explained in the Post Friday, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple responded to statements that they were racist by claiming that Maurice's dismissal was the most reasonable one, as they were afraid that they would not be able to trust her after they offended her.
"My wife sent him something I didn't mean.
He's not racist.
We're not racist people," said the husband, Joel Plasco, at the Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you've been rude to, even if it was by mistake?
A baby?
Come on."
Plasco, who compared the demand to a "extortion," said that his wife had two months left to have a baby and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Are you going to pursue something like this?
It's not a very kind attitude," added the investor banker.
The legal case is still unresolved and the public opinion court has rushed to denounce the couple on social media and condemn their behaviour and logic.
Paddington's editors feared readers wouldn't identify themselves with a talking bone, according to a new letter.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said in connection with the letter: "It's hard to put herself in someone's place who first reads it before his publication.
It's very funny, now that we know what we know about the great success of Paddington."
He explained that his father, who had worked as a BBC camera before having the inspiration to write the children's book on a small teddy bear, was optimistic about the rejection of the book, and said that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "aggressive," after his death last year.
Describes Paddington as a very important member of his family and fears that his father was very proud of the success he had finally achieved.
"He was a discreet man; he wasn't a presumptuous man," he said.
"But since Paddington was as real to him, it was practically as when your son gets something: you pride yourself, even if it's none of your business.
I think he thought that way about Paddington's success.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he used to recognize Paddington's own merit."
My daughter was dying and I had to say good-bye on the phone
When they landed, they took their daughter in a hurry to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors worked on it to save her life.
"No one often called to say it was very serious and they didn't expect it to get over it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperuse.
"Then I rang a call from Nad and told me that he would die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to him.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so, pretty.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll go with you.
The drugs they had given him so that his body would continue beating were being consumed and they were getting out of his system.
He had died before he was planned and everything was gone.
I just had to sit and wait, because I knew what was going on.
I could not cry or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by relatives and more people.
I had to keep up the good manners."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperuse, now grieving over the loss of her daughter, embarked on the plane with the rest of the passengers, distracted from the experience that was going on.
"No one knew," he said.
"He had his head and tears kept falling.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I felt a feeling of sympathy for the overwhelming Nad.
The feeling I needed my love and understanding.
I know I wanted her a lot."
Women of grief hang cards to prevent suicide on a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide are working to prevent others from doing so.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been hanging cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and telephone numbers that citizens can call for assistance.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and at the age of 18, he was killed.
"I don't want any father or mother to feel what I should feel every day," he said.
Mrs. Davis, aged 45, residing in Lydney, said her son was a promising chief with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said their smile could light up any room."
However, he left his job before he died because he was in a "very dark spot."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found him after he took his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I am constantly concerned that there is a side effect."
Mrs. Davis created the cards "because people know that there are people to whom you can turn, who can listen, even if it's a friend.
Don't be silent: you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after Mark's mother died.
"Never said he wasn't well, nor was he depressed or anything like that," he said.
"A couple of days before Christmas we observed a change of attitude.
He touched the bottom of Christmas, when the children opened their gifts and he didn't look them in the eyes or anything."
He said his death would be a great trauma to them, but they would have to work it out, "Open a hole in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we must continue and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh endures through a thread while the FBI initiates an investigation
"I thought that if we could get something like what he asked for (an investigation with a limited scope and time), we could get a certain unit," said Mr. Flake on Saturday.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Its reticence has to do with the moment.
It's only five weeks away for the November 6 half-term election, if, as expected, Republicans don't get good results, they'll see weaknesses in getting the man who wants to be elected to the country's main court.
George W. Bush has been taking the phone to call the senators and pressuring them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who has worked at the White House for Mr. Bush, and also met his wife Ashley through Mr. Bush, as he was his personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI believes their report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where currently there are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's still unclear if Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the Vice President, to untie the tie and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean deserters "cauca" with Kim
The number of deserters from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean legislator.
Park Byung-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Southern unification, said there had been 1,127 desertions last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the strict border controls between North Korea and China and the rise in human traffickers' prices had been the main factors.
Pyongyang hasn't made any public comments.
Usually, most deserters in the North are offered citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul sources claim that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most escape through China, which has a longer border with North Korea and is easier to create than the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers illegal migrant deserters, instead of refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.
The relationship between the North and the South, which is technically still at war, has improved considerably in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, leaders from both countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks focused on ongoing negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This happened after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in general terms to work to achieve a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will not disarm ourselves unilaterally," Mr. Ri said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is a "historical" and is not fit to work in the High Court.
The leader of the Nancy Pelosi House minority said that the candidate for the Brett Kavanaugh High Court is a "historical" and that his temperament makes him unable to work in the High Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival held in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if a woman had acted this way, they would have told her it's an "historical," Pelosi said regarding her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee Thursday.
Kavanaugh, excited, denied the charges of sexually abusing Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes screaming and being speechless as he talked about his family and his years in high school.
He also explicitly condemned the Committee's Democrats and said that the charges against him were "a grotesque and coordinated murder of a character" organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that Kavanaugh’s witness showed that he could not work in the High Court because he showed prejudice against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with these statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats," he said.
Pelossi showed reluctance when he was asked if he would try to challenge Kavanaugh's election, if it's confirmed, and if the Democrats get the majority in the House of Representatives.
"That's what I can say: if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not only not able to be in the High Court, but also in the court where he is now," Pelosi remarked.
Kavanaugh is currently serving as a judge at the Columbia District Circuit Appeal Court.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about the decisions that Kavanaugh could make against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe case against Wade, since he is considered a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearings, he shirked questions as to whether he would set aside certain decisions of the High Court.
"It's no time for a hysterical and prejudiced person to enter the court and hope it looks wonderful to us," Pelosi said.
Women must exercise their power.
It's a justified diaphragm: months and years of plenty of anger and can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual.
He continued... "I was very helped by a woman who was an executive somewhere who told me she was also crying when she was angry, but who developed a tactic that consisted of, when she was angry and started crying, to tell the person she was talking to, "You may think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then he went on.
I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are allowed as a way out for anger in part because, basically, they misunderstand.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs in an office with most men, where I once ended up crying with an unspeakable rage, is that of a bigger woman (a cold directive that had always frightened me a little bit) who grabbed me from my neck and dragged me to the eye of the ladder.
"Never let them see you crying," he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy, because they'll have you."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democratic Member of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart as a presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was discovered in an extramarital adventure on a boat called Monkey Business and retired from the career, Mrs. Schroeder, very frustrated, thought there was no reason not to explore the idea of herself as a presidential candidate.
"It wasn't a well-meditated decision," he said as he laughed 30 years later.
"There were already seven other career candidates and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone said, "White and the seven dwarfs."
Because he was late for the campaign, he was late for his fundraising, so he promised he would not enter the race if he did not raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
He discovered that some of his supporters, who gave $1,000 to men, were only willing to give 250 to her.
"Do you think I have a discount?" she wondered.
When he gave his speech and announced that he would not start a formal campaign, he was so overwhelmed by the emotions (freedom from the people who had helped him, frustration with the system for the difficulty of raising money and to direct himself to voters, rather than to delegates, and anger, and sexism) that he became speechless.
"You might have thought you had a nervous breakdown," Mrs. Schroeder recalled about the reaction of the press.
"You might have thought my corporate sponsor was Kleinex.
I remember thinking, what will they put in my grave?
"Will she cry?"
How the US-China Trade War Can Benefit Beijing
The initial rescues of the US-China trade war were shocking and, although the war does not seem to have to end soon, a distance countries can benefit Beijing in the long run, according to experts.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, issued his first warning early this year, when he imposed taxes on China's major exports, such as solar plates, steel and aluminum.
The most significant climb occurred this week, with new oranges that affect products worth $200 billion, these oranges impose taxes on half of all goods arriving in the United States from China.
Beijing has counter-attacked every time in the same way and has recently raised oranges from five to ten percent for $60 billion of American goods.
China has committed itself to replicating the United States and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will soon be back.
Making Washington back involves giving in to some demands, but leaning publicly in front of the United States would be too shameful for Xi Jinping, the President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of trade war with the United States could benefit China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of both economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that started a fall in any of these countries is far more dangerous than the witnesses had anticipated," says Abigail Grace, an Asian-centered researcher associate at the Center for New American Security, an expert committee.
Syria is "prepared" to return refugees, according to the Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria says it is prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild the country, devastated by a war of more than seven years.
In front of the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country are improving.
"Currently, the situation on the street is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas that terrorists destroyed to restore normality.
All the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that had to be abandoned due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and maintenance are met.
The EU estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
There are also six million people in the country who need help.
Al-Moualem affirmed that the Syrian regime is grateful for any help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that financed the insurgency.
Europe's selection wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European selection has achieved the 2018 Ryder Cup to defeat the US selection with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The United States has already lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European selection won the crown once again when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who fought during most of the tournament, threw the rush out of the water into the hole by 3 16, which gave the victory to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shined in all his series and became one of the four players who achieved 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was set aside with 5&4 by the less qualified player of the European Thorbjorn Olesen selection from Denmark.
The world's most qualified player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 with Ian Poulter from England, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran with eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the biggest winner the tournament ever had, with 25.5 points of career.
"I don't need to cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
Thank you, Thomas, for choosing me and believing me.
I'm so happy, so glad I got the drink back.
The team is the most important... and I'm glad I was able to help," said Garcia excitedly after the European victory.
Passes the relay to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in an individual competition on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to have won Tiger Woods, I grew up following him," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches he had in France and now has a career record at the Ryder Cup of 13-21-3.
A strange statistic for one of the best players that ever existed, with 14 big titles won and just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. selection fought all weekend to search the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-class golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's frustrating performance: "I'm proud of these players, they fought.
There was a moment this morning when we pressed the European selection.
We fought.
I'm taking my hat off for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
His 12 players played very well.
We'll regroup, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and make progress.
I love these 12 players and I'm proud to have been their captain.
There's something to take off your hat.
They have defeated us."
