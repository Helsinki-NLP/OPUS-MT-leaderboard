How long have these symptoms been going on?
And all chest pains have to be handled in this way especially in your age
And together with fever
and blood pressure and cholesterol you also need to check
And are you fevering now?
And do you feel this chest pain right now?
And are you also having trouble breathing?
And can you tell me another symptom that you're having along with this symptom?
And ever get to how high your fever?
and I also coughed
And I'm a little pellet and cough
And I feel heavy chest pain today
And it's a rhinitis allergic season.
and pain in the chest
And I think I'm also a little fever
And I want you to explain where your chest hurts
And they also have fever.
And with your diabetes history
And you know, my chest feels like it's gonna crumble
And do you know, people always cough towards me
And you feel chest pain
And you say that there's pressure in your chest
anyone in the family who has heart problems, heart disease, heart attack, high cholesterol, high blood pressure
Is there any symptoms or other problems that you're looking at along with muscle pain?
Is anyone else sick like you at home with the same symptoms?
Do you feel any other symptoms?
Have you ever felt such a waste of breath?
Do you still feel chest pain?
'Cause it's the flu season.
But we must not aside the pain of the chest that comes from the heart.
But the most important problem now is this chest pain.
And I'm having trouble breathing.
but I know a lot of coughing towards me
But we need to deal with every chest pain very seriously.
but now you can breathe well?
I really forgot the cause of this chest pain.
Does it feel like there's a person who squeezes your chest?
It still feels like a waste of breath.
Do they complain about the same symptoms?
Do you have a chronic problem like high blood pressure or something?
Do you have any medical problems or other chronic diseases like diabetes?
Do you feel as bad as that chest pain?
Are you suffering from high blood pressure?
Do you feel the need to breathe along with that symptom?
Do you know what symptoms he experienced?
Did you see the picture?
Drink a lot of fluid today
But I had a diabetes test.
But he has a somewhat similar symptom to me.
How high are your fevers?
How's your blood pressure?
if your fever continues
if your fever is one hundred and two or higher
If you think symptoms or problems you need better checking
I had a fever yesterday.
I also had a little fever.
I had a fever yesterday.

I'm also having trouble breathing.
I'll send an image to you.
I feel chest pain today
I just feel a little headache and fever today
According to my opinion, it's a flu
According to my opinion, it's a little flu
Does it feel like there's a very heavy person sitting in your chest?
All start off with headaches and fever at a time almost at the same time
It hurts in the middle of my chest
pressure like chest pain
in my chest
in the middle of my chest
in the middle of the chest
I'm in pain in my chest.

like high blood pressure or diabetes
like right in the middle of the chest
for the fever, you can drink tachypirin sweet
Mary, how many days have you had these symptoms?
You said that you felt chest pain
sometimes I feel chest pain
All right, if there's any other symptoms with these symptoms other than pain
Or someone sitting in your chest?
nearly the same as fever, cough, headache, and muscle pain
Right in the middle of my chest
Show me in this picture where you feel sick
'Cause you got a fever.
So, do you think some of these symptoms might be related to pregnancy?

A cumulative outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) that increased rapidly in the European Union/European Economic Area and Britain Raya, January 1 to March 15, 2020
The cumulative case of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows a similar trend in the European Union/European Economic Area and the UK that confirmed that, despite its different stages depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic developed very rapidly throughout the country.
Based on the experience of Italy, the country, the hospital, and the intensive care unit should improve its requirements for the expansion of COVID-19 patients who will need health care, especially intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, the classer case of pneumonia with unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, Tiongkok.
On January 9, 2020, the Tiongkok Disease Control and Prevention Center reported that this disease is a new coronavirus that is now called coronavirus acute breathing syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus (COVID-19).
Evidence to date shows that about 80% of COVID-19 sufferers have a mild disease, that is, respiratory infection with or without pneumonia, with most of these patients being cured.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 develops into a more severe disease and requires hospital care, while 6% of other cases suffer from critical illness requiring intensive care.
Mortality of patients treated in the hospital because of COVID-19 about 4%.
In this study, we studied the cumulative COVID-19 European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and British Raya (UK) and compared it to the incident in Hubei Province, Tiongkok.
We also compare the number of COVID-19 cases currently in the EU/EEA and the UK with the number of cases in Italy during 31 January–15 March 2020.
COVID-19 case in EU/EEA country and UK
After Tiongkok, COVID-19 experienced a more distant and dynamic geographical spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in other parts of the world, currently following the dynamics of the pandemic in Tiongkok.
On March 11, 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In Eurosurveillance 2020 of March 5, Spiteri et al. reported the first Europeans with the COVID-19 case confirmed based on the definition of the WHO case.
In the EU/EEA, three confirmed first cases were reported by France on January 24, 2020 to those returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, Tiongkok.
On March 15, 2020, COVID-19 cases have been detected throughout 30 EU/EEA countries and Ingris Raya (UK), between December 31, 2019 and March 15, 2020, including 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths from Italy alone.
Acquiring cumulative numbers and cumulative incidents of COVID-19 cases
At the European Disease Prevention and Control Center (ECDC), the number of COVID-19 cases reported to every country around the world is updated daily at 8:00 a.m.; this amount is obtained only from official sources such as the State Health Ministry, the national and regional health authority, and WHO.
This data is used to assess the COVID-19 train in the EU/EEA and the UK, and compare it to the train in Italy.
As a proxy for the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated a 14-day cumulative incident, so we calculated the natural journey of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA country and the UK, in the period 1 January–15 March 2020.
We also presented a cumulative number of cases reported by each country until March 15, 2020 at 8:00 compared with Italy during the period January 31–15March 2020.
COVID-19 train in the EU/EEA country in the UK
The 14-day COVID-19 incident in the EU/EEA and the UK generally follow the Hubei Province (Tiongkok) train (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the COVID-19 cumulative incident began to rise about February 21, and then sharpened about February 28, 2020.
This train is mainly driven by the rapid increase in the number of cases reported from Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK show the similar COVID-19 cumulative increase trend.
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK compared with the cumulative number in Italy during the period 31 January–15 March 2020.
The data points out that, by March 15, at 8:00, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK have reported a total number of cases comparing the total number of Italian cases three weeks earlier or less.
Our findings indicate that the number of COVID-19 cases reported increased rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Trains observed at the COVID-19 cumulative incident require that pandemics increase at comparable speeds across all countries.
It's regardless of the degree of difference that countries face, the diversity of public health responses, and the possible difference between the country and the protocol to choose the patients to be tested for COVID-19 confirmation, which includes the final test.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors in the affected region of Italy explained the situation about 10% of COVID-19 patients need intensive care and media sources report that hospitals and intensive care units in this region have reached their maximum capacity.
Currently, COVID-19 data received at the hospital and/or intensive care units at EU/EAA level are available only for each 6% and 1% (data not shown).
However, data should be collected in a systematic way to complete current surveillance data that focuses on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
The study carried out in 2010-2011 showed a wide variation in the availability of intensive care and Mady care in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 per 100,000 in Portugal.
This means that countries can have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds intensive care and Mady care per 100,000 population in 2010-2011).
The modeling scenario related to the capacity of health care, with an estimate of the prevalence of COVID-19 inap for each EU/EEA and UK countries related to risk >90% exceeded the capacity of intensive care beds, provided in the update of the six rapid risk assessment ECDC on COVID-19.
Since so far the case has been classified in a particular region in the EU/EEA and the UK, and the hospital and intensive care units usually serve the population of certain regional services, information on cases and beds intensive care should be provided at the level of the Regional Unit for Statistics 2 (NUTS-2).
Experience from Italy and the current train in other countries shows that the COVID-19 pandemic developed very rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Therefore, countries, hospitals, and intensive care units should prepare themselves for the SARS-CoV-2 community transmission scenario and increase the number of COVID-19 patients requiring health care, especially intensive care, as is the case in the affected region of Italy.
As shown in recent ECDC rapid risk assessments, rapid, proactive, and comprehensive approaches are very important to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a shift from the approach of shelter to the approach of mitigation, because an increase in the number of rapid cases, as anticipated, may not give sufficient time to decision makers and hospitals to understand, accept, and adapt the correct response if it does not previously apply.
Those rapid risk assessments also set out the social health steps to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short window of opportunity when the country has the possibility to further improve its control efforts in slowing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reducing the pressure on health care.
If fail, other EU/EEA health care systems may face a patient’s surge that requires intensive care in a few days or weeks to come.
The disease of the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19), caused by chronic acute breathing syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in Tiongkok and elsewhere in the world, causing disaster to humans.
Similar to the homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from bats and caused similar symptoms through similar mechanisms.
Even so, COVID-19 has a lower level of severity and mortality than SARS, but it is more contagious and more about age than young people, as well as more in men than women.
As a response to the rapidly increasing number of publications about this new disease, this article tries to provide timely and comprehensive reviews of the subject of rapid research.
We'll discuss the basics of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and disease prevention.
Although there are still many unanswered questions, we hope that this review will help to understand and eradicate this threatening disease.
The Semi Summer Festival on January 25, 2020 has become an unforgettable and unforgettable memory for all the Tionghoa people who are told to stay at home during the holiday and a few weeks later due to a new virus epidemic.
This virus is very homologous with coronavirus (CoV) which caused severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and the disease caused by it is called CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
Early epidemics in Wuhan, Thungkok, and rapidly spread across the country and to almost 50 other countries around the world.
By March 2, 2020, this virus has led to 80,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, with more than 40,000 patients returned and 3,000 patients died worldwide.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is "enemy of number 1" and potentially destroys more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), within less than two months since the first report on 7 January 2020 establishing a sequence of viruses isolated from some patients, more than 200 papers have been published on COVID-19, which includes virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment.
This review seeks to build on research in this rapidly expanding new subject.
As possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other coV-related diseases, which are central eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS, disease in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far about disease prevention and prognosis and some other unanswered but urgent questions.
According to tradition, CoV is considered a nonletal pathogen for humans, mainly causing about 15% pills 4.
Even so, in this century, we have found a highly pathogenic CoV for humans twice, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, each causing the outbreak that began in Tibet in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012 and soon spread to many other countries with horrible morbidity and mortality.
Therefore, COVID-19 is now the third CoV epidemic in human history recorded.
As shown in Gbr. 1.1, an unknown class of pneumonia was first reported from Wuhan on December 31, 2019 to the National Commission of the People's Republic of China.
Seven days later, the CoV was launched.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatal case of Wuhan was reported.
Meanwhile, epidemics spread rapidly to cities, provinces, and neighboring countries.
On January 20, the health care provider infection was reported, which implies that human-to-human transmission may occur.
On January 23, quarantine areas were treated in Wuhan and all public transportation was stopped.
On January 24, the first clinical study of this disease reported that, out of 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 patients were directly exposed to the Wuhan marine food market that was considered to be the initial location of infection from unknown animal sources.
On January 30, WHO declared this plague a global health emergency.
By the time this report is written, this disease has spread throughout the country and nearly 50 other countries around the world (Gbr. 2).
Because the situation developed very rapidly, the final extent and severity of the plague still had to be established.
On 11 February 2020, a multi-center study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, presented the following more up-to-date epidemics (https://mp.weixin.qqq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infects people at all ages, but especially at 30-65.
Nearly half (47.7%) of infected people are over 50 years old, only a few under 20 years old, and only 14 people under 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 more infect men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 spreads into the cluster, especially inside and around Hubei.
COVID-19 takes an average time of 5 (2-9) days from awitian to diagnosis.
The average incubation period is 4.8 (2.0-7.2) days.
The average time from the awitan to the death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
Base reproduction (R0) is 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and R0 corresponds to 2.23-4.82.
The number of people infected increased exponentially before 23 Jan. 2020, according to the time of mass transportation prior to the Semi Festival in Tyeongkok.
Mortality of patients with confirmed cases of 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and similar mortality for all patients of 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
Three major risk factors for COVID-19 are type of male, age (≥60 years), and heavy pneumonia.
CoV is a large clustered subfamily virus containing a single RNA sine.
CoV can be divided into four genes: alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, with alpha- and beta-CoV known to infect humans.
Glycoprotein bud or spike (S) cap binds to its cell receptor, angiotensin 2 (ACE 2) enzyme and peptide peptide 4 (DPP4) each for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, then membrane fusion occurs.
The RNA gene was released into the siteplasma; after replication of the virus genome, the genomic RNA was accompanied by the glycoprotein cover and the nucleopaksid protein formed a virion-containing vesicle, which then had fusion with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genetic sequence SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 is a new type beta-CoV with a genetic similarity of more than 99.98% of the 10 consecutive samples; the sample is taken from the site of the outbreak, the John Seafood Market in Wuhan.
Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Through electron transmittal microscopes, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in the epithelium section of the very thin human breath channels.
ACE2 humans were found to be receptors for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
Nevertheless, the S SARS-CoV-2 protein binds to ACE2 humans weaker than its binding to the S SARS-CoV protein, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes infections that are not distinctly SARS-CoV infection in patients.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein signed with orf3b and protein secreted with orf8 password.
Orf3b SARS-CoV-2 protein may play a role in virus pathogenicity and inhibition of IFNβ expression; however, orf8 has no functional domain or motive known.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al. reported complete human cryo-EM structure ACE2 in resolution 2,9 and in complex with transporting B0AT1 amino acid.
They found that the complex, which has open and closed conformations, is assembled into dimers and ACE2-B0AT1 complexes can bind two S proteins, which is evidence for CoV recognition and infection.
B0AT1 can be a therapeutic target in medicine coating to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The original and the midwaywayway
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to come from bats and each is transmitted to humans through muzzles and camels.
By comparing the phylogenetic SARS-CoV-2 with the other CoV, bats are considered as the original SARS-CoV-2 inang because this new virus is 96% identical with the two similar CoV-SARS of bats called bats-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intercessors that help the virus cross the species’ barrier to infect humans are still unknown, and the transmission route remains to be explained.
Ji, et al. proposed snakes as carriers of bats to humans involving homologous recombination within S protein.
According to one study, researchers in Guangzhou, Tiongkok, suggest that dating, mammalian long eating ants often used in traditional Tionghoa drugs, has potential as a swim between SARS-CoV-2 based on 99% genetic homologies on CoV found in the snack and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% difference throughout the genome is still a great difference; hence, conclusive results as concrete evidence have not yet been obtained (Gbr. 3).
The physical chemistry of SARS-CoV-2 is largely unknown.
In vitro, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can last for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at 20 °C and moisture 40%-50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar traits.
It is reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet and hot rays at 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol 75%, disinfection containing chlorine, acid perectate, chloroform, and other fat growers, but not chlorhexidin, effective to disable the virus.
Generally speaking, the entire human population does not have immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and because it is vulnerable to this new virus.
Currently, there is no detailed study reporting on the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to another CoV research before, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Gbr. 4).
Generally speaking, after invading the inang, the virus is known by the underlying immune system through the pattern identifier (PRR), which includes C-type lectin-like receiver, Toll-like receiver (TLR), NOD-like receiver (NLR), and RIG-I-like receiver (RLR).
Through different pathways, viruses induce inflammatory factor expression, dendritic cell maturation, and type I interferon synthesis (IFN) that restricts the spread of viruses and accelerates antigen virus phagositesis by macrophages.
However, N protein in SARS-CoV can help the virus avoid immune responses.
Soon, adaptive immune response joined in combating this virus.
T lymphocytes, which include CD4+ and CD8+ cells, play an important role in this defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce antibodies specific to viruses, and CD8+ T cells kill cells directly infected with viruses.
The T-cell helper produces a pro-inflammatory sitekin to help protect the cell.
Even so, CoV can hinder T cell function by inducing T cell apoptosis.
Humoral immunity, which includes complexities, such as C3a and C5a, and antibodies are also important in combating virus infections.
For example, antibodies isolated from patients who have recovered have neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, excessive immune response produces a large number of free radicals locally, which can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and, on the worst scenario, failure of male organs and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is marked with the awitan cluster, is more about age with an early-onset disease and a pregnant woman.
In general, people who are exposed to viruses in large numbers or whose immune function is disturbed have opportunities for infection higher than others.
Estimated the average incubation period SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, most of them 3-7 days based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases shows that the average incubation period is 3 days and ranges from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as explained above, shows that the period of incubation 4.8 (3.0-7.2) day based on demographics 8,866 cases.
It is important that health authorities adjust effective quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period so as to prevent infected people, but without symptoms, transmit viruses to others.
As a general practice, people who are exposed to viruses or infected are usually required to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should quarantine be extended for up to 24 days?
Fever is often the primary and early COVID-19 symptoms, with or without other symptoms such as dry cough, wheezing, muscle pain, limbo, headache, throat pain, rhinorea, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients experience dyspnoea and/or hypoxemia one week after a disease.
In severe cases, the development of a patient’s disease is rapidly becoming acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients suffering from fever and/or respiratory symptoms and acute fever, even if without lung imaging, must be infected against the virus for early diagnosis.
Demographic studies at the end of December 2019 show that 98% of the symptoms for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnea, and 3% for diarrhea; 8% patients require ventilatory support.
Similar findings have been reported in two recent studies, that is, studies in family groups and clusters due to the transmission of asymptomatics.
In comparison, demographic studies in 2012 showed that patients with MERS-CoV also experienced fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and dyspnoea (55%) as their main symptoms.
However, 80% of patients require ventilating support, much more than COVID-19 patients and are consistent with higher MERS mortality than COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and throat disease (21%) are also observed in patients with MERS.
In SARS patients, fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnoea (40%-42%), diarrhoea (20-25%), and throat disease (13-25%) were indicated as major symptoms and ventilation support required for approximately 14%-20% patients.
By February 14, COVID-19 mortality was 2% with confirmed cases reaching 66,576 worldwide.
By contrast, SARS mortality in November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on a demographic study in June 2012, mortality was 37% of 2,494 confirmed cases.
Previous study reported that R0 SARS-CoV-2 reaches 6.47 with confidence interval (CI) 95% of 5.71-7.23, while R0 SARS-CoV is only 2-4.
Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality, and R0 given in Table 1.
Those numbers indicate that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher ability to spread than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but not as deadly as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Therefore, the challenge of controlling the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is greater than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV pandemic.
Clastrian novels are often found in one family or from a group or a vehicle like a cruise ship.
Patients often have travel stories or live in Wuhan or other affected areas or contact with infected people or patients in the last two weeks before the awitence.
However, it is reported that people can carry viruses without showing symptoms more than two weeks and patients returned from the hospital can bring viruses again, which leads to caution to increase quarantine time.
In the early stages, the patient has a normal or decreased count of periferous white blood cells (especially lymphocytes).
For example, lymphopenia with the count of white blood cells < 4×109/L, which includes the count of lymphocytes < 1×109/L, and the level of aminotransferase aspartate and increased viremia found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
Heart and muscle enzymes and myoglobin increased in the blood of a number of patients, as well as C-reactive proteins and blood flow rates increased in most patients.
In patients with heavy cases, D-dimer levels increase, that is, the fibrin count in the blood, and the count of lymphocytes decreases progressively.
Chest photo deficiency was found in a large COVID-19 patient and marked with a bilateral magical shadow or ground-glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients often experience atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory failure syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation, and progressive fibrosis greatly worsen the interference of gas exchange.
Pneumocyte dysfunction type I and type II lowers surface levels and increases surface pressure and lowers lung capacity to develop and increase lung colapsible risk.
As a result, the worst finding of the thoracic photos is often paralleled with the worst level of disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed pneumositis dislocation, hialin membrane formation, and interstisial lymphocyte infiltration, as well as seminal cells that had a lot in patients' lungs who died of this disease, according to the pathology of virus and ARDS infections and similar to the pathological analysis of SARS and MERS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection by reaction to a back transcriptase polymerase chain (RT-PCR) used as the primary criterion for COVID-19 diagnosis.
However, because of its false negative levels, which can accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which no longer depends on RT-PCR) in Thailand on 13 February 2020.
Similar situations also occur in SARS diagnosis.
Thus, the combination of medical history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and radiological findings is vital and a necessity to make effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, group Feng Zhang explained the technical use protocol SHERLOCK based on CRISPR to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detected the synthetic RNA fragment SARS-CoV-2 at 20 × 10-18 mol/L up to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter input) using a valve within less than one hour without requiring complicated instrumentation.
Hopefully, these new techniques can greatly enhance sensitivity and ease when verified in clinical samples.
Due to the lack of experience with the new CoV, the doctor mainly offers supportive care to COVID-19 patients, while attempting various therapies that have been used or previously proposed for other CoV care, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other viral disease (Table 2).
This therapy includes current therapy and potential therapy with antivirus drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from patients who have been cured, traditional Tionghoa drugs, and psychological support.
Even the plasma of patients who have recovered is recommended for use in therapy.
The pharmaceutical company competes to develop antibodies and vaccines against this virus.
In the early stages, SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacked the lungs and may also attack other organs that express ACE2 at a lower level, such as gastrointestinal and renal systems.
However, the dysfunction and failure of breathing are a major threat to patients and the main cause of death.
Therefore, support for breathing is vital for easing symptoms and saving lives, which include general oxygen therapy, high flow oxygen, noninvasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the level of disease severity.
Patients with heavy breathing symptoms should be supported by extracorporum membrane oxygenation (ECMO), which is a short thermodified cardiopulmoner technique used to treat heart failure or breathing that threatens the soul.
Furthermore, maintenance of electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shocks, and protection of vital organ function are also important for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
Excessive immune response to the known immune system results in a sitekin storm in SARS and MERS patients.
The sitekin storm is a systemic inflammatory response that is marked by the release of the sitekin series, which includes TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNę, and MCP-1.
These sitokins induced immune cells to release a large number of free radicals that were the main cause of ARDS and failed the male organs.
Immunosuppression is very important in managing the siteokine storm, especially in severe patients.
Kortikosteroid and Tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, has been used to handle siteokin storms.
Other immunosuppression handling for siteok storms include modulation of immune response directed to T cells; transfer of IFN-ς, IL-1, and TNF; inhibition of JAK; blinatumomab; signaling sitekin 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroid, as an immunosuppressant, is widely used in SARS treatment to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high - dose steroids are useless for severe lung injuries in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, steroids can result in heavy side effects, especially osteonecrosis, which greatly affect prognosis.
Nevertheless, short-term short-dose corticoid giving until it is recommended to be given carefully to critically ill COVID-19 patients.
At the time of this review, no effective anti-virus therapy has been confirmed.
However, intravenous redesivir, an analogue nucleotide, was found to be active in a COVID-19 patient from America.
Remdesivir is a new antivirus drug developed by Gilead, returning to the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marlburg.
Later, remdesivir also showed inhibitions against another single flock RNA virus, including MERS and SARS.
Based on this, Gilead has provided this compound for Tyeongkok to do a series of tests on people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are highly anticipated.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as potential therapy for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, heart damage, and other side reactions may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of this therapy with other drugs that patients use should be monitored closely.
Plasma of patients who have recovered and made antibodies
There is a long history of the collection of healthy patients from infectious diseases to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to prevent healthy people from suffering from it.
True, patients who have been cured often have a relatively high antibody level in their blood.
Antibodies are immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by lymphocyte B to fight the pathogen and other foreign objects, recognize the unique molecule on the pathogen, and directly neutralize it.
Based on this, plasma is collected from the blood of a group of patients who have recovered from COVID-19 and injected into 10 patients who are seriously ill.
Their symptoms improve in 24 hours, along with decreased inflammation and viral load and increased oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification needs to be done to submit the method for large scale use before specific therapy is developed.
In addition, in addition to its therapeutic effects, some plasma - related deficiencies should be considered accurately.
For example, antibodies can overstimulate immune responses and cause sitekin release syndrome, which is potentially threatening toxicity.
Antibodies concentration in blood is usually low and plasma is required in large numbers to treat critically ill patients.
The development and production of specific antibodies quickly enough to combat global epidemics is difficult to do.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from patients who have recovered and identify genetic codes that signal effective antibodies or perform effective antibodies to proteins that are important to viruses.
In this way, we can easily increase the scale of antibody production.
TCM has been used to treat various diseases in Tiongkok for thousands of years.
However, most of the effects depend on the combination of different components in the formula. This formula depends on the diagnosis of disease based on the TCM theory.
Most effective components are still unknown or not clear because they are difficult to extract or verify the component or its optimal combination.
Currently, because effective and specific therapy for COVID-19 is not yet available, TCM becomes one of the main alternative therapies for patients with mild symptoms to date or for people recovering from heavy illness.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsule and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsule were found to be useful for COVID-19 therapy.
The highest rate of recovery in COVID-19 patients is observed in some provinces of TCM using TCM in 87% of its patients, which includes Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while Hubei provinces, which use TCM in only about 30% of COVID-19 patients, have a low level of healing (13%).
However, this comparison is still very harsh because many other factors, such as the number and severity of patients, have to be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and his friends released a study comparing western drug therapy (WM) only with the combined therapy of WM and TCM.
They found that the time required for the recovery of body temperature, the loss of symptoms, and the treatment of inap is much shorter for the WM+TCM group than for the WM group alone.
What is more impressive, the level of symptom poisoning (from light to heavy) is much lower for the WM+TCM group than for the WM group alone (7.4% compared to 46.2%) and lower mortality in the WM+TCM group compared to the WM group (8.8% compared to 39%).
Nevertheless, the effectiveness and security of the TCM still await better controlled trials on a larger scale and in more research centers.
Another interesting thing is to identify the working mechanism and clarify the effective component in TCM therapy or its combination, if possible.
Most patients suspected or confirmed COVID-19 are very afraid of a very contagious and even deadly disease, and those who are quarantined also feel boredom, loneliness, and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infections such as fever, hypoxia, and cough and side effects therapy such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can cause greater anxiety and mental pressure.
In the early stage of SARS, a series of psychiatric morbidity, including depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor symptoms, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicides have been reported.
Finding a history of contact and mandatory quarantine, as part of the public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak, can make people more anxious and feel guilty about the effects of transmission, quarantine, and stigma of relatives and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided for COVID-19, expected patients, and those in contact with them, as well as the public community in need.
Psychological support should include the establishment of multidiscipline mental health teams, clear communication with routine and accurate updates on SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, and plans for therapy and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are vital to break the transmission chain from the animal and human reservoirs infected with vulnerable swims and are often equipped with anti-virus therapy in controlling epidemics caused by virus outbreaks.
Efforts have been made to develop a protein-based S vaccine, which is long-term and effective in making antibodies penetrate and/or immunity that protects against SARS-CoV.
For SARS, live-weak vaccines have been evaluated on experimental animals.
Nevertheless, the in vivo effectiveness of this vaccine candidate in age and model lethal challenges and its protection against zoonotic virus infections should still be determined before clinical studies begin.
This may be because SARS dropped 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since then.
On the other hand, the sporadic case and the MERS cluster continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions because there are still zoonotic sources in the endemic region.
Vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS by using disabled viruses, DNA plasmids, virus vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles, and recombinant protein subunits and some have been evaluated in experimental animals.
The development of vaccines against safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 for non-imune people is a very urgent and important task of controlling the ongoing epidemic.
However, this difficulty is not easy to overcome because it is a long time to develop vaccines (normally 18 months) and dynamic CoV variations.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to show clinical travel to thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover without symptoms.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, the development of disease prognosis models is vital for health care bodies to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on the clinical study reported so far, the following factors can influence or be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table 3):
Age: Age is the most important factor for SARS prognosis, which also applies to COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly occurred at 30-65 years of age with 47.7% patients over 50 years of age in studies containing 8,866 cases as explained above.
Patients in need of intensive care tend to have involvement and complications and significantly older age than patients who do not require intensive care (aged 66 years over 51 years), which refers to age as a prognostic factor for the outcome of COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infects men more than women (0.31/100,000 than 0.27/100,000), as explained above.
Comorbidities and complications: COVID-19 patients who require intensive care are more likely to experience acute heart injuries and arrhythmia.
The events of the heart also cost the primary cause of death to SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 reported can also bind to colangiosis with ACE2-positive, which can lead to heart dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It should be noted that age and underlying disease are highly correlated and can influence each other.
Abnormal laboratory findings: C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects inflammation or tissue damage and is suggested as a potential prognostic factor for disease, response to therapy, and final recovery.
The correlation between the CRP and the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 has also been proposed.
In addition, increased dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) can also help predict final results.
These enzymes are expressed very high in various organs, especially in the heart and heart, and released during tissue damage.
Therefore, these enzymes are a traditional marker for heart and heart dysfunction.
Major clinical symptoms: Photo thoraks and development of temporal clinical symptoms should be considered together with other things to predict the end results and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As explained above, steroids are widely used as supportive therapy for infection to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Because high - dose corticosteroids are widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors of this disease eventually suffer from avascular osteonecrosis with disability throughout life and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used in low doses and short-term doses in COVID-19 patients.
Mental pressure: As explained above, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients suffer from extraordinary stress because they have to undergo long - term quarantine and extreme uncertainty and witness the death of close family members and fellow patients.
Psychological counseling and long-term support must be given to help this patient recover from stress and return to normal life.
Based on demographic studies so far, COVID-19 seems to have an epidemiological image different from SARS.
In addition to replication in the lower breathing channels, SARS-CoV-2 can efficiently replicate in the upper breathing channels and cause mild or no symptoms in the early stage of infection, similar to other CoVs that cause pills.
Therefore, in the early stages or incubation period, infected patients can produce viruses in large numbers during their daily activities, which cause great difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, SARS-CoV transmission is believed to occur when patients are seriously ill and most do not occur at an early stage.
Thus, the current COVID-19 outbreak is much more severe and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
At present, great efforts are being made in Tyeongkok, which includes quarantine of the Wuhan and surrounding cities and quarantine continue almost the entire population with the hope that the SARS-CoV-2 transmission will be terminated.
Even though this action has severe economic and other sectors in the country, the number of new patients has declined, which indicates the slowdown of the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate that the plague will end in March and the decline phase lasts for 3-4 months.
Some other experts, however, were not as optimistic.
Paul Hunter et al. estimates that COVID-19, which seems to be much more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al. made a model to predict the end result of the epidemic and stated that SARS-CoV-2 can infect two thirds of the global population.
The Canadian research group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the mid-conka usp and the patient's throat that had been cured and returned from the hospital two weeks earlier.
Even so, the signs of the promise take place in Tyeongkok, if seen on the basis of the decrease in the number of new cases, which shows that the current strategy might work.
Ebola repredicted will cause one million cases with half as well as death.
However, with quarantine and strict isolation, this disease can eventually be controlled.
Maybe also, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 weakened its ability to infect and eventually disappeared or became not too pathogenic that could be adjacent to humans.
Comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS epidemics given below (Gbr. 5).
SARS-CoV-2 is very easy to transmit through cough or sneezing, and perhaps also through direct contact with materials contaminated by the virus.
This virus was also found in the fecesses so that it revealed the possibility of a new transmission, that is, the transmission of fesses-to-mouth.
Recent studies in 138 cases reported that 41% of cases may be caused by nosopomyal infections, which include 17 patients with previous diseases and 40 health care providers.
Therefore, careful preventive action must be taken to protect humans, especially those providing health care, social workers, family members, workmates, and even those who are incidental to patients or those who are infected.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is through the use of facial masks, both surgical masks and respiratory masks N95 (the 1860s) help control the spread of viruses.
The surgeon’s masks ensure that the spitting of the infected potential is not in the air or attached to the surface of the material, where the spitting can be passed on to others.
However, only the N95 mask (the 1860s) can protect against virion inhalation with a size of 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% virion can completely retract; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size, both of which are about 85 nm.
Because particles can retract even five surgical masks that are stacked into one, health care providers who have direct contact with patients should wear N95 (the 1860s) and not a surgical mask.
In addition to masks, health care providers should wear adequate insulation to reduce contact with the virus.
A virus can also infect a person through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor infected with SARS-CoV-2 even though he wore an N95 mask; the virus might enter his body through eye vision.
Therefore, health - care providers should also wear eye - open shields or glasses while working with patients.
For public communities in affected or potentially affected areas, it is highly recommended that everyone wash his hands with soap disinfected more often than usual, try to stay at home for independent quarantine, and avoid contact with potential infected people.
Three-foot distance is believed to be appropriate to keep the distance from the patient.
These actions are an effective method of reducing the risk of infection and preventing the spread of viruses.
While SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus for the human world, its high homology with SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, should be a major warning for Tyeongkok that has strong memories of SARS disease in 2003.
However, on January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Disease Control Center calmed the population by saying that this new virus has a low spread quality and limited reproductive capacity from humans to humans and prevention and the spread of this disease is not an issue.
This message greatly soothes the public's fears, especially as the whole country is preparing for the Semi Festival, so that this critical time has passed to stem the disease that is still small in Wuhan.
The disease - control body in Tyeongkok should learn from this and make great improvements in the future.
For example, this body should (1) be more careful when making public announcements because every word is observed by the people and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) more sensitive and responsive to unusual information than clinics than waiting for official reports from a physician or authorized officer; (3) more restricting the use of epidemic potential at the early stage, rather than trying to calm the public; and (4) more often providing targeted and effective training to improve public awareness of the epidemics of disease and periodic testing and improving community response systems.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus that began to fire at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, the plague has spread to the whole of Beijing and over 50 countries in the world at the time of this review.
Because this virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and COVID-19 symptoms and SARS are similar, the COVID-19 outbreaks give an impact like a repeat SARS outbreak.
However, there are some clear differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are very important for protecting the epidemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 is more about age than young people and more about men than women, and the death rate is also higher in age than young people.
SARS mortality is higher than COVID-19 mortality (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
A COVID-19 patient transmits viruses even when they're without symptoms, while a SARS patient usually transmits viruses when they're seriously ill, which makes it more difficult to protect the COVID-19 spread than a SARS.
This explains some of the reasons that SARS-CoV-2 spread faster and wider than SARS-CoV.
The routine RNA assay to examine SARS-CoV-2 can deliver negative results to some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, patients who have been cured can also have a positive effect on virus testing.
This finding greatly increases the risk of virus spread.
With the rapid progress of COVID-19 research, some important issues still need to be resolved, namely:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although genetic homology was found 96% between SARS-CoV-2 and two coV-like bat SARS, we still can't conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is from bats.
What animal is the intermediate species to feed the virus from the original water, say bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answer number 1 and 2, we can't break out the transmission effectively and the plague can fire back at all times.
Although molecular and biochemistry modelling shows that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter the respiratory cell and lead to further pathological changes?
Does this virus also bind to cells that express ACE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot achieve rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will this epidemic last?
How does a virus develop genetically during transmission between humans?
Will this pandemic become world-wide pandemic, end up like SARS, or repeat periodically like flu?
Answers to the above questions and many other statements are very important, but it may take time to find them.
Still, whatever the price, we have no choice but to stop this epidemic as soon as possible in order to return to normal life.
Zoonotic origin of human corona virus
For thousands of years, mutations and adaptations have moved the co-evolution of the co-evolution of the co-evolvions of the coronal virus (CoV) and its inhalation, including humans.
Prior to 2003, two human CoVs (HCOVs) were known to cause mild disease, such as selemma.
A severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) reverses the situation and reveals how much HCOV infection can be very damaging and threatening the soul.
The appearance of SARS-CoV-2 in the center of Tyeongkok at the end of 2019 has brought CoV back into the background and shocked us with a high transmission, but with lower pathogenicity than his brother, SARS-CoV.
HCOV infection is zoonosis, so the understanding of the origin of HCOV will benefit us.
Most HCOV comes from bats, and in this animal, the virus is not pathogenic.
The inang reservoir between some HCOVs is also known.
The identification of the animals has a direct involvement in the prevention of human disease.
An investigation of CoV-inang interactions on animals can also give important insights about CoV pathogenesis in humans.
In this review, we present our current general overview of seven HCOVs, focusing on its history of discovery and zoonotic origin and transmission of its interspecies.
What's important is that we compare and compare the HCOV from the perspective of evolution and genome recombination.
The 2019 CoV disease epidemic (COVID-19) is currently discussed in this context.
In addition, the requirements of the successful diversion of the sea and the implications of the evolution of the virus in the severity of the disease are also highlighted.
The Coronaviridae virus (CoV) is part of the Coronaviridae family, which consists of a group of secretive RNA viruses, positive indra, and single-breasted.
This virus has the largest genome in the size of 26 to 32 kilobases among RNA viruses called "CoV", because its morphology looks like a crown under electron microscope.
According to its structure, CoV has an unsegmented genome that has a similar mapping.
About two thirds of the genomes consist of two large open readings (ORF1a and ORF1b) that are intertwined, and both are translated into polyprotein replicas pp1a and pp1ab.
Polyprotein undergo further processing to form 16 nonstructural proteins, called nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome consists of an open reading (ORF) for structural protein, which includes stems or spikes (S), lining or envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleoprotein (N).
A number of specific completion proteins for a given line of descent are also endorsed by various CoV line of descent.
Based on differences in the protein sequence, CoV is classified as four genes (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV); among the four genes, the beta-CoV gene has the most HCOV and is further divided into four lineages (A, B, C, and D).
The phylogenetic evidence shows that bats and predators are the sources of most alpha-CoV and beta-CoV genes, while the nails are the main gamma-CoV and delta-CoV reservoirs.
For thousands of years, CoV has continued to cross the species barrier and some CoV has become an important pathogen in humans.
So far, there are seven known human CoVs.
Among the seven viruses, HCOV-229E and HCOV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
Five other beta-CoVs cover HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, chronic acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), central eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, and HCOV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as pills and/or diarrhea.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing the infection of the underweight respiratory tract in relatively more patients and has a higher chance of developing into acute respiratory disorder syndrome (ARDS) and manifestations outside the lungs.
Strain HCOV-229E first, B814, isolated from the patient's ingest that ended in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more and more knowledge has been gathered through in-depth study of HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43, both of which have caused symptoms to heal themselves.
In fact, this concept has been widely accepted that HCOV infections are generally harmless, until SARS outbreaks occur.
The SARS outbreak that occurred in 2003 was one of the most devastating epidemics in history today, which infected more than 8,000 people with a severe death rate of about 10%.
Ten years later, the outbreak of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) caused a continuing epidemic in the Arab Peninsula with sporadic spread to other parts of the world.
The new 2019 HCOV (2019-nCoV), later called SARS-CoV-2, is a kaustative agent of the 2019 virus epidemic (COVID-19), which has taken over 3,120 people's lives and infected more than 91,000 people until March 3, 2020.
The alarm has gone off and the world has to prepare for the coming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
The seven HCOVs all have zoonotic origins of bats, rats, or pets.
A lot of evidence supports the evolution of all HCOVs from bats. In bats, CoV adapts well and is nonpathogenic, but shows a great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has created an extraordinary medical, scientific, social, and moral challenge for the rest of the world.
Zoonotic HCOV tracking provides a working framework for understanding natural history, driving power, and the limiting factor of inter-species displacement.
This study can also drive or facilitate the search for reservoir animals, intermediaries, and SARS-CoV-2 amplifiers, which have an important involvement in future prevention of spread.
In this review, we provide a general picture of zoonotic origin, interspecies transmission, and HCOV pathogenesis.
We specifically highlight and discuss the general subject that HCOV parent viruses are usually nonpathogenic in its natural reservoirs, but become pathogenic after transmission of interspecies to the new water.
We also describe the HCOV evolution trend that increased transmission capacity is often accompanied by reduced pathogenicity.
The end result of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is also discussed in this context.
The animal coV has been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to HCOV-229E strain B814 first of the patient's ingust insolations, various CoVs have been isolated from infected animals, including turkeys, rats, cows, pigs, cats, and dogs.
In the last few days, seven HCOVs have been identified.
A brief overview of the history of HCOV in the chronological order (Table 1) is an informative guide.
Strain HCOV-229E was first isolated from a patient's airway that had upper respiratory infection in 1966, which was then adapted to develop in the WI-38 lung line.
Infected HCOV-229E patients show symptoms of soreness, which include headaches, sneezing, fatigue, and sore throat, with fever and cough that are seen in 10~20% cases.
Next in 1967, HCOV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and serial pathways in tiny brains that are still feeding.
The clinical image of HCOV-OC43 infection appears to be similar to the infection caused by HCOV-229E, which can not be symptomatically distinguished by the pathogen infection of other breathing channels such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43 spread worldwide and tend to be most transmitted during the winter in the surrounding climate.
Usually, the time of incubation of these two viruses is less than a week and followed by a period of pain for about two weeks.
Based on a human volunteer study, healthy HCOV-229E suffer mildly.
Only a few patients with a weak body immune system showed an infection of the lower respiratory tract.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", is a pandemic due to the first HCOV documented well in human history and its etiologic agents are SARS-CoV, which is the third HCOV found.
The first SARS case can be traced back to the end of 2002 in Guangdong Province, Tiongkok.
SARS epidemic caused 8,096 cases reported with 774 deaths, which spread across many countries and continents.
Despite the superterrestrial, each case is expected to cause about two secondary cases, with incubation periods of 4 to 7 days and the peak of the virus's load seen on the 10th day of the disease.
The patients infected with SARS-CoV first experienced myalgia, headache, fever, nausea, and shivering, followed by dyspnea, cough, and breathing disorders as further symptoms.
Lymphopenia, abnormal heart function testing, and kinase in creatinine enhancement are the common laboratory abnormalities in SARS.
Damage to alveolar diffusion, epithel cell proliferation, and macrophageal enhancement are also observed in SARS patients.
Next, about 20-30% of patients require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, some organs that include the gastrointestinal, heart, and kidneys can also be infected in heavy cases, usually accompanied by a sitokin storm, which can kill, especially in patients with weak immune symptoms.
The virus was first isolated from the open lung biopsy of zero-patient relatives traveling to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, great efforts have been devoted to HCOV research.
HCOV-NL63 is isolated from the seven-month-old from the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
The virus was initially very common in small children, old age, and patients who were weakly immune from respiratory disease.
Corice, conjunctivitis, fever, and common bronchiolitis are found in diseases caused by HCOV-NL63.
Another independent study explains the same virus isolation from eight-month-old nasal specimens that suffer from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although identified in the Netherlands, the virus is actually spreading worldwide.
It is estimated that HCOV-NL63 represents about 4.7% common respiratory disease and the peak of the event occurs at the beginning of summer, spring, and winter.
HCOV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, which is also called krup.
In the same year, HCOV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been treated for pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to pneumonia and community bronchiolitis, HCOV-HKU1 was reported to be related to acute asthma exaserbation.
Similar to HCOV-NL63, HCOV-229E, and HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 found worldwide, causing mild respiratory disease.
The four HCOV communities have been adapted to humans and are generally small-scale in the form of highly pathogenic diseases, although this is a case of extraordinary occurrence for unknown reasons, as in the case of the newly reported subtype HCOV-NL63 more virulent caused by heavy lower respiratory infection in Tyeongkok.
Generally, when it gets the ability to move efficiently and continue to maintain itself within humans, this HCOV virulence and pathogenicity are also diminished.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from a 60-year-old patient's lung with acute pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most confirmed laboratory cases come from the Middle East, the case of import is sometimes secondary to close contact has been reported in various European and Tunisian countries.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The MERS clinical manifestation is similar to the SARS clinical manifestation, which refers to progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients also experience acute kidney failure, which so far only happens to MERS among HCOV-related diseases.
More than 30% of patients show gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
By 14 February 2020, more than 2500 confirmed laboratory cases were reported with the death of a high case, 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most frightening viruses known to humans.
In mid-to late December 2019, the cluster of patients with retrospective pneumonia was associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, Tiongkok.
The World Health Organization (WHO) states that the underlying respiratory infection epidemic is ongoing and caused by SARS-CoV-2 as a Global Health Emergency and calls it COVID-19.
By March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a fatal death rate of 3.4 per cent.
It needs to be noted, the death of a case in Hubei, Tiongkok, 4.2%, while the death of a case outside Hubei is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 caused a heavy respiratory infection like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV with a picture of fever, cough, and wheezing.
Diare is also found in a number of patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can rapidly develop into acute respiratory disorder.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar because of the high nucleotide sequence homology, 82%, both clustering into different phylogenetic branches.
SARS-CoV-2 pathogonism is much lower, but more contagious than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
The infected subject SARS-CoV-2 without symptoms has been reported and may play a role in the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 throughout the world.
Comparing and distinguishing SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCOVs shows very interesting similarities and differences.
First, incubation times and duration of HCOV disease travel are very similar.
In this case, SARS-CoV-2 followed another six HCOV general train.
Second, the COVID-19 devastation lies between SARS-CoV and four other HCOV communities (yakni HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, and HCOV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection showed a more common picture of HCOV infections in the Community, which included a picture of nonspecific symptoms that were mild or even without symptoms.
On the other hand, a small number of severe COVID-19 cases can look like SARS-CoV infections even though with a slightly lower ratio.
Third, the SARS-CoV-2 transmission also shows an interesting pattern characteristic, having a similarity with both HCOV community and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the ability to transmit SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as the community HCOV.
On the other hand, there is a decrease in SARS-CoV-2 transmission capacity after some human pathways still need to be verified, as is the case with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Last, just like the other HCOVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected from the faeces sample.
"Is the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 faecal-oral important, such as in the case of SARS-CoV transmission, at least in certain situations, that still needs to be clarified by the next study."
What's also important to know is whether SARS-CoV-2 is seasonal as in the HCOV case community.
However, the image of SARS-CoV-2, which includes the transmission capacity, pathogenesis, and continuous spread in some pathways on humans, would have a profound impact on the fate of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
Four HCOV communities that cause mild symptoms have all been adapted to humans.
From another point of view, it can be said that humans have adapted to these four HCOVs.
In other words, both HCOV and humans may be ancient HCOV pandemic survivors.
HCOVs that cause severe diseases in humans and humans who have severe HCOV diseases have disappeared.
In order for this to happen, HCOV must replicate within humans in sufficient numbers to allow adaptive mutation accumulations to be used against the factors of swimming restriction.
Thus, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 disease survives and the more people are infected, the greater the likelihood that this virus will be fully adapted to humans.
If the virus is properly adapted, the transmission to humans will be difficult to stop with quarantine or other infection control steps.
Over the years, four community CoVs have flown into the human population and triggered a sequencing on the immunocompetent.
This virus doesn't need an animal reservoir.
On the contrary, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are highly pathogenicly unadapted with humans and their transmission in humans cannot be maintained.
Both have to defend themselves and breed in zoonotic reservoirs and look for opportunities to spread to vulnerable human targets, possibly through one or more interships and amplifications.
SARS-CoV-2 has an image similar to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four HCOV communities.
SARS-CoV-2 is very easy to transmit as HCOV community, at least now.
However, SARS-CoV-2 is more pathogenic than HCOV communities and is not septicogenic SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
Still have to be observed whether SARS-CoV-2 will adapt fully with humans and circulate in humans without a reservoir animal or a interplay.
Before we discuss the origin of HCOV animals, we need to discuss the definition and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate, and HCOV amplifiers.
Animals act as an evolutionary HCOV wave if they have close relatives and share high homology at the secondary level of nucleotide.
The ancestor virus usually adapts well and is nonpathogenic in this swim.
Similarly, the reservoirs carry HCOV continuously and in a long period of time.
In these two cases, the swim is naturally infected and is a natural swim for HCOV or parent virus.
On the other hand, if HCOV has just entered the midlife wave just before or about the time the virus enters the human, the virus has not been adapted to the new and often pathogenic.
It can function as a zoonotic source of human infection and act as an amplifying vessel by allowing the virus to replicate temporarily, then transmitting it to humans to enhance the scale of human infection.
HCOV can experience a dead end infection if it can't maintain its transmission in the mid-range.
On the other hand, HCOV can also adapt to the midships and even cause long - term endemicity.
In this case, the midwives become natural reservoirs.
Epidemiological data reveals retrospectively that zero SARS cases have a history of contact with predators.
Next seroprevalence studies indicate that the animal seller has a higher IgG anti-SARS-CoV prevalence than the general population.
The moon musang (Paguma larvata) and larvata dog in the live animal market is the first time identified with the almost identical SARS-CoV-like virus.
In short, this is supported by the fact that no more SARS cases have been reported since all the muzzles in the market were killed.
However, it is reported that the moon mounds of the wild or the unexploded farm in the living animal market are mostly the result of negative testing for SARS-CoV, which means that the moon mounds may only act as the interstellar amplifier, but not the natural resorvoir of SARS-CoV.
It needs to be noted, because 80% of the various animals in the Guangzhou market have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, it cannot be ruled out that many small mammal species may also function as an amplifier vessel between SARS-CoV.
All these waters seem to be the final ones of SARS-CoV.
The search for a natural animal for the next SARS-CoV reveals a close-breasted bat CoV, called the Rhinolopus bat-sars HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is found in the bat of the Tionkok horse mat.
This bat provides positive test results for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and a sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genomes.
This CoV and the other bat CoV share the nucleotide-sequent homology 88-92% with SARS-CoV.
This study became the foundation for a new concept that bats are the water for new human pathogens.
Some similar CoV-SARS (SL-CoV) are also identified by bats, but only one, named WIV1, can be isolated as a live virus.
Angiotensin 2 (ACE2) enzyme known as SARS-CoV receptor.
WIV1 from bat faeces samples is shown to be using bats, muslims, and humans as receptors to enter the cell.
Interestingly, the serum saRS convalsen can neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the closest-neighbour ancestors with SARS-CoV in bats, with 95 percent nucleotide-sequent homology.
Despite the homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the direct parent virus SARS-CoV and bats are not the direct SARS-CoV reservoir.
The phylogenetic analysis grouped MERS-CoV into the same group as the bat's CoV-HKU4 and the bat's CoV-HKU5.
CoV-HKU4 bats and MERS-CoVs use the same ring receptor, namely peptide peptide 4 (DPP4), as a virus entry.
The polymerase RNA sequence depends on the MERS-CoV RNA phylogenetically closer to the beta-CoV bat that is identified from Europe and Africa.
Until now, there's no living MERS-CoV found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and his closest relative CoV-HKU25 bats share only 87% of the nucleotide sequence homologies.
That's why bats may not be the direct container of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East show that Arab camels give seropositive results for specific antibodies that neutralize MERS-CoV, just like Middle Eastern camels in some African countries.
MERS-CoV is an identical life with the virus that was found in humans isolated from the root of Arab camels, which further indicates that camels are the actual reservoirs for MERS-CoV.
It is also important to note that the entire massive virus with symptoms that are usually mildly observed on experimental camels infected with MERS-CoV.
It needs to be noted, the infected camel not only through the respiratory route, but also through the fecal-oral route, which is also the main route of the entire virus from the bat.
However, questions remain unanswered because many confirmed MERS cases have no history of contact with camels prior to the symptoms, possibly due to human-to-human transmission or unknown transmission routes involving unknown animal species that carry MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% of nucleotide homologies with RATG13 bat CoV isolated from the Rhinolophus finis bat.
As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 is too large to establish parent relationships.
In other words, bats may not be a SARS-CoV-2 direct reservoir, unless almost identical bat coVs were found in later days.
It is possible that the animal between SARS-CoV-2 is one of the species of wild animals that were sold and killed at the John Seafood Wholesale Market, and many early COVID-19 cases have to do with this market, which indicates the possibility of transmitting animals to humans.
Some recent studies based on the metagenomic sequence show that a small group of endangered mammals, known as trengiling (Manis javanica), may also bring beta-CoV ancestors related to SARS-CoV-2.
This new twin CoV gene shares 85-92% of the nucleotide sequence homologies with SARS-CoV-2.
However, the CoV is closely related to RaTG13 with the equivalent of 90% at the secondary level of nucleotide.
Both are grouped into two by-products of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in phylogenetic trees, one of which shares receptor bonding domains that are more similar to SARS-CoV-2, with a sequence of 97.4% amino acid.
What's remarkable, RBD SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 are even more different, although the same level of homology as the whole genome is higher.
Previous study of a diseased trench also reported contiguous detection of a lung sample, which was also closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted a different method of insertion and manual curation to produce a sequence of partial genomes consisting of about 86.3% of complete virus genomes.
We can't rule out the possibility of tringling as one of the animals between SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support SARS-CoV-2 is directly from the callage because the secondary difference between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV relatives-SARS-CoV-2 is being dated.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 is closer than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV relatives-SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutionary route SARS-CoV-2 in bats, twitching, and other mammals still have to be set.
Although the highest secondary homology in RBD was found between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV relatives-SARS-CoV-2 trengiling, SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 share the highest homology in the sequence of the entire genome.
It's too speculating if it's said that the level of similarity between the RBD beta-CoV relatives-SARS-CoV-2 trending and SARS-CoV-2 is driven by the selective convergence evolution in the mediation.
Opposite hypothesis supports recombination between beta-CoV relatives-SARS-CoV-2 trenchling and RatG13 in the third species of wild animals.
As a factor of evolution, recombination occurs between beta-CoV.
Researchers still can't decide on the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCOV, zoonotic sources HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-NL63, and HCOV-HKU1 have also been investigated.
Phylogenetic evidence indicates that HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-229E may originate from bat CoV, while HCOV-OC43 and HCOV-HKU1 parent viruses have been found in predatory animals.
It is reported that the bat CoV called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) detected in the three-coloured North American bat shows close friendliness with HCOV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCOV-229E is genetically related to other bat CoV, named Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, detected in Ghana, with Camelidae expected to be the midwife.
To make it more clear, current knowledge of the origin of HCOV animals is provided in Figure 1 and Table 2.
The phylogenetic analysis has proven the occurrence of the interspecies transmission of HCOV in history.
In about 1890, when HCOV-OC43 crossed the species of livestock to infect humans, it was reported that there was a respiratory infection pandemic.
History of HCOV-229E interspecies transmission is unclear.
The bat's alpha-CoV that's related to HCOV-229E has been found.
Between them, there's alpha-CoV alpaka.
Some evidence supports the direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First of all, humans, not apricots, may be exposed to bats in the interrelationship of ecology.
Instead, humans have close contact with the alpace.
Second, bat alpha-CoVs that are related to HCOV-229E have various types and nonpathogenic in bats, while alpaca alpha-CoV causes respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpha-CoV alpaka was not found in feral animals.
That's why the alpaca's possibility of getting alpha-CoV relatives-HCOV-229E from humans can't be sidetracked.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogens, which include rabies viruses, Ebola viruses, Nipah viruses, and Hendra viruses.
Therefore, it is not too surprising that bats may directly transmit HCOV-229E to humans.
Another possibility, while bat alpha-CoV functions as a HCOV-229E gene extender, alpaca and Arab camel may function as an intercom that transmits virus to humans, exactly like the MERS-CoV case.
MERS-CoV is a very good example of transmitting interspecies from bats to Arab camels and from Arab camels to humans.
The evolutionary source of MERS-CoV from bats is known on early identification of viruses and is also reinforced by subsequent findings.
Clearly, bats are rich species of viruses for the exchange of interspecies genetic fragments and interspecies transmissions.
Long ages, colonies set up meetings, close social interactions, and strong flying skills, all are conditions that support bats to be ideal 'virus spreads'.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been entering the Arab camel for decades.
This virus has been adapted to the camel that has changed from the midwives to the stable and natural reservoirs.
MERS-CoV caused a very mild disease and maintained a relatively low mutation rate in this animal.
The sporadic transmission to humans happened by chance and humans remained the final wave for the MERS-CoV because the transmission could not continue.
Unlike the role of the camel in the MERS-CoV transmission, the role of the call, if any, in the transmission of the different SARS-CoV-2.
Especially, the beta-CoV is very pathogenic in the call.
Calling may be the final ring for beta-CoV relatives SARS-CoV-2, similar to the musang in SARS-CoV case.
In future studies, some possible transmission of SARS-CoV-2 interspecies from animals to humans should be calculated or side-by-side.
First, bats could be a reservoir pool for SARS-CoV-2 relatives virus that is almost identical with SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share an ecologically long line with bats through the slaughter or coal mining.
Second, trestilling could be one of the intermittent amplifiers for the newly entered SARS-CoV-2 friendly virus.
Humans have viruses through slaughter and consumption of meat.
Maybe, a lot of mammals, including pets, are vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2.
Antibodies surveillance of pets and wild animals need to be done.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may occur in a third species that is well-connected with bats and trenching.
The search for SARS-CoV-2 animal is still ongoing.
Despite various types of animals, three main factors on the virus side are also important to make it easier for CoV to cross the species barrier.
First, the relatively high rate of mutation in RNA replication.
Compared to another single-breasted RNA virus, the rate of CoV mutation can be considered "current" to "high" with an average replacement rate of ~10-4 per year per stop, depending on the CoV adaptation phase to the new wave.
CoV has exoribonuklease correction, elimination that results in very high mutability, attenuation, or even impermissibility.
Interestingly, the Remdesivir analogue nucleotide is known to press CoV replication by inhibiting this exoribunuklease and dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents to be tested in clinical trials.
Even so, the rate of CoV mutations is about a million times higher than the rate of the inhalation.
In addition, the rate of mutation is often high when CoV is not adapted to the water.
Compared to the SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate, the rate of SARS-CoV-2 mutation is actually lower, requiring a higher level of adaptation with humans.
Probably, SARS-CoV-2 has adapted to another vessel close to humans.
Besides SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV that has been adapted to the Arab camel.
Theoretically, the small possibility that genetic hyphen would quickly make vaccines and anti-virus agents against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective.
Second, the large RNA genome in CoV gives extra flexibility in genome modification, for mutations and recombination, so it increases the probability of interspecies co-evolution, which is beneficial for the emergence of new CoV at the appropriate time.
This is supported by many unique open reading patterns and protein functions that are signaled towards the end of the 3′ genome.
Third, CoVs often change templates randomly during RNA replications through a unique "chosen-salin" mechanism.
In a wave that functions as a mixing vessel, the rotation of the camel often occurs during the CoV RNA transcription.
Complete RNA and highly homologous subgenomics can be recombined to form new CoVs.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-OC43, as well as in animal coV such as bat SL-CoV and bat CoV-HKU9.
Virus interactions in relation to transmission
In addition to the three factors mentioned above, the interaction of the virus with the inang receptor is another major factor that affects interspecies transmission.
Here, the recombination of SARS-CoV is considered a special example, which also shows positive selection during the interspecies transmission event.
Based on the comparative analysis between human SARS-CoV isolates and musang, SARS-CoV is expected to undergo rapid adaptation in various waves, especially with mutations in RBD protein S.
Generally, RBD protein S CoV interacts with the cell receptor and intensively becomes the target response of the inhaled antibody.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is 318 amino acid to 510 in S1 fragments, which binds to human ACE2 and its correspondents as a virus entry.
The RBD SARS-CoV has the ability to recognize receptors of various animals, including bats, musks, rats, and rakan dogs, which allow transmission of interspecies viruses.
In fact, only six amino acid residues observed differ between human and musang virus isolates in RBD and 4 of them are located on the receptor binding motive for interaction with ACE2 receptors.
SARS-CoV musang has K479N mutation and S487T mutations in its RBD, which may increase the affinity of the tone protein interaction with the human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, two substitutions of amino acid may be very important for adapting viruses to humans.
It needs to be noted that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S1 protein S units involves protein binding affinity S with ACE2 humans are likely to have changed.
In fact, a cryo-EM study showed human ACE2 bonding affinity and S proteins SARS-CoV-2 10 to 20 times higher than human ACE2 affinity and S proteins SARS-CoV.
What's also important to know is whether there's another corridor that might be needed to transmit SARS-CoV-2.
Interesting thing, HCOV-NL63 also binds to ACE2, but with different parts on S.
There are many other HCOV receptors, like an aminopeptidease N for HCOV-229E and 9-O-teracetylase acid for HCOV-OC43.
These receptors may also play a role in the success of this CoV adaptation in humans after transmission of interspecies from the animal's water.
In addition to the cell receptor, the final results of the interspecies HCOV transmission are also arranged by other factors of dependence and restriction of the water.
The difference between these water proteins between humans and natural reservoirs, such as bats, Arab camels, and rodents can be a barrier to interspecies transmission.
HCOV must take over the water dependency factor and break down the water limitation factor in order to succeed in interspecies transmission.
In this case, molecular determinants of the interaction of these important viruses still need to be identified and identified.
The entire genome is inexhaustible to see the factor of the dependence and restriction of the SARS-CoV-2 by using the most advanced CRISPR technology may be beneficial.
There's a new HCOV: back to the beginning of the plague.
CoV's behavior gave the bat a great chance to show up the new HCOV.
In this case, the bat coV functions as a HCOV gene extender.
In addition, rapid mutations and genetic recombination also move HCOV evolution and function as two important steps in this process.
For example, the destruction or loss of new potential protein receptors dramatically modifying virus phenotypes.
Among the SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 is expected to play an important role in adaptation to humans because the isolated SARS-CoV bat virus is found with a variety of ORF8 proteins.
SARS-CoV with a characteristic feature of the elimination of 29 nucleotide found on the strain that was isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This deletion separates ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is expected to be an adaptive mutation that supports water diversion.
In addition, SARS-CoV may have a history of recombination with the alpha-CoV and gamma-CoV line, with a large number of smaller recombinant areas identified in the RNA polymerase that depends on RNA.
The recombination location is also identified in nsp9, mostly nsp10, and some nsp14.
Similarly, the recombination of the various lines of descent occurred in the MERS-CoV epidemic, which occurred in the Arab camel in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other HCOVs where HCOV has been recombined with other CoV animals in its nonstructural genes.
It should also be noted that artificial selection can play a role in accidental changes to the viral genome, most likely due to the release of viruses from the selection pressure, such as by the immune system of the swim.
This example of effect is the complete orf4 disappearance of HCOV-229E prototype strain due to the elimination of two nucleotides.
While full ORF4 can be observed in bat and camel viruses closely related to HCOV-229E, alpha-CoV alpaca shows the single nucleotide lining that results in the movement of order.
Last but not least, HCOV evolution was also moved by the selection pressure in its reservoir.
A mild or no symptoms are detected when a bat is infected with CoV, which shows an adaptation between CoV and bats.
Looks like bats adapt well with CoV in anatomy and physiology.
For example, failure in the activation of the proinflammation response on bats will effectively lower the coV triggered pathology.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells on bats is stressed because of the increased regulation of the receptors of the natural killer cells of NKG2/CD94 and the low level of molecular expression complex histocompatibilities of the main class I.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) of high bat metabolic activity can pressure CoV replication and influence correction by exoribonuklease to give the selection pressure for the creation of highly pathogenic virus strains when entering the new wave.
More pathogenic CoV strains may also develop through recombination, which results in new protein formations or new protein features for the adaptation of the water.
Therefore, it is not a coincidence that three new HCOVs have emerged in the last two days.
CoV is nonpathogenic or causes mild symptoms in the reservoir, such as bats and camels.
CoV replicates strongly without triggering strong immune response.
This is where the secret of having a carrier without symptoms and causing heavy cases of human infection lies.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to excessive immune response and siteokine storms, with worsening lung damage if immune response increases.
On the other hand, on the carrier without symptoms, the immune response has been removed from the CoV replication.
The same strategy to decide the immune response bond may benefit in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon response is especially strong on bats.
Therefore, the gift of type I interferon, at least in the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection on humans, should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of NLRP3 inflammation in bats is defective.
For this reason, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammation with MCC950 may benefit in COVID-19 handling.
SARS-CoV-2's onset follows the general flow of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While bat beta-CoV shares 95% nucleotide homologies with SARS-CoV have been found, bat coV shares 96% nucleotide homologies with SARS-CoV-2.
Although the weed and other animals in the market were found to carry an identical virus with SARS-CoV, the direct interweave for SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been found.
The trendy beta-CoV that is very homologous with SARS-CoV-2 has been found, which shows that the trending may play a role as one of the mid-range or beta-CoV trecalling may contribute gene fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Though still questioned, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was created by both humans on purpose and unintentionally.
CoV's back into focus because of SARS-CoV-2's recent outbreak.
CoV studies in bats and other animals have greatly altered our perception of the importance of zoonotic origin and animal reservoirs for HCOV in human transmission.
So much evidence shows that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are from bats and are transmitted to humans through the midwayer.
Considering that SARS-CoV infection stems from contact between humans and muslims in the wet market, perhaps the closure of the wet market and the murder of all the wets in it that effectively ends the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, trestilling should be transferred from the wet market to prevent zoonotic transmission, considering the discovery of some of the twin-coV lines that are closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
Nevertheless, truth and mechanism SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through trenching and other mammals still need to be clarified in future research.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in Arab camels for a long time.
This camel acts as an important transport tool and as a major source for meat, milk, skin, and wool products for local society.
Arab camels spread across the Middle East and Africa.
That's why we can't kill all the camels to control MERS, just like we did at the wildlife market in Tiongkok to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop the MERS outbreak, a comprehensive approach must be made to develop vaccines for effective camels against MERS-CoV and combined with other infection control steps.
Before we get rid of this virus, new genotypes can appear and cause the plague.
Some zoonotic coVs travel in the wild.
Especially, the bat coV with zoonotic potential is very varied.
There are many possibilities for this zoonotic CoV to evolve and experience recombination, resulting in a new CoV that is easier to transmit and/or more deadly to humans in the future.
Cultures eat wild animals in some places in Tyeongkok must be left to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 experiences, better preparation and contingency plans must be applied.
In fact, many viruses have been on this planet since ancient times.
These viruses are in the natural reservoir until there's a chance to spread.
Although bats have many traits that support the spread of viruses, humans’ chances of contacting bats and other wild species can be minimized if people are educated to avoid wild animals.
Continuing surveillance of mammals needs to be done to better understand the ecology of CoV and its natural swimming, which will prove beneficial in preventing the transmission of animals and future epidemics.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent the zoonoses of the virus is to protect the distance from the ecological reservoirs of the zoonotic virus.
Some parts of the SARS-CoV-2 zoonotic puzzle have not been found.
First, if bats transmit SARS-CoV-2's ancestor virus to trenching, the condition when bats and trenchs share ecological long is an important thing to know.
Second, if bats have a more direct role in human transmission, the way humans react to bats must be determined.
Third, if there is a third mammal that plays the role of the intercessor, the way the mammal interacts with other species, which include humans, bats, and tangles, should be clarified.
Finally, because many mammals, including pets that may be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, both experimental infections and surveillance must be done.
Whether bats, trenillas, or other mammals, are expected to be identified in the future by SARS-CoV-2 or his almost identical parent virus.
The ongoing investigation in this field will outline the evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with an important involvement in the prevention and control of COVID-19 on humans.
The diagnostic criteria for "expected case" and "confirmed case" COVID-19 need to be updated
On February 6, 2020, our team published the rapid guidance for diagnosis and treatment of new 2019 coronary infection (2019-nCoV), which was based on our experience and became a good reference to combating pandemics worldwide.
Nevertheless, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are increasing based on current research and clinical practical experience; hence, the diagnosis and management strategy continues to be updated.
In this letter, we answered one of the comments in our guide and provided the latest diagnostic criteria for the "expected case" and "confirmed case" based on the Guide Diagnosis and Management for COVID-19 (Seventh Version) issued by the National Health Commission of the Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has caused the outbreak, which is now formally referred to as the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the virus is named the coronavirus acute breathing syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, WHO explained COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed rapid guidance and guidance has been published online at Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
That guide has attracted much attention since it was published.
However, it should be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, our consciousness and knowledge are increasing based on current research and clinical practical experience; hence, diagnosis and management strategies continue to be updated.
For example, the Guidelines for Diagnostics and Handling of COVID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of the Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) between January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020, this commission has issued a total of seven editions with some contexts have changed quite widely.
Our guide received comments from Zhou et al., they introduced a proposal for a simple score based on their clinical experience.
Their work adds new evidence for our guidance and becomes valuable references to this pandemic around the world.
We support their meaningful work and express our gratitude.
Nevertheless, their findings also require updates based on the Guide to Diagnosis and Handling for the latest COVID-19 (the seventh trial version) and the latest study.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm the suspected case it is necessary to combine one of the epidemiological narratives with two clinical manifestations to create comprehensive analysis, or to establish three clinical manifestations if there is no clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) history of travel or stay in Wuhan and its surrounding area, or other community where the COVID-19 case has been reported in the last 14 days before the warning; (2) history of contact with the contagious case SARS-CoV-2 (with positive acid test); (3) history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan and its surrounding area, or other community where the COVID-19 case has been reported within the last 14 days before the warning; (4) history of contact with confirmed case cluster (≥ 2 cases with fever and/or respiratory symptoms occurring within 2 weeks in the small area, such as home, office, school class, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or breathing symptoms; (2) feature of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell count shows normal lymphocyte count, decreases, or decreases in the early awit stage.
Confirmed case diagnosis should be based on the expected case with one of the pathogenic or serological evidence as follows: (1) real-time PCR test positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) whole sequence of viruses show high homogenity for known new coronary artery; (3) positive for specific IgM antibodies and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in serum test; or antibody change specific IgG-SARS-CoV-2 from negative to positive, or titer increases ≥4 fold at the recovery phase above the level at the acute phase.
We can see that CRP test real-time nuclear acid in a sample of the respiratory or blood lines added in the second edition (18 January 2020) and the third (22 January 2020).
Pathogenic detection of blood samples added to the fourth (January 27, 2020) and fifth (February 8, 2020); then serological evidence added to the seventh edition.
This modification is based on ongoing research by researchers to search for optimal nuclear acid detection kits for rapid diagnosis, as well as samples from the airway including blood intake, which enhances the availability of various specimens, and supports the inclusion of certain positive antibody results into confirmed criteria.
In addition, there is more evidence that reminds us to guard the patient with an atypical and unrecognizable symptoms.
Therefore, Zhou et al.'s ring has to be updated because they classify people without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The score system also needs to be verified in future clinical practice and studies.
As a closing, we hope that more direct evidence will appear and ask the reader to comment.
For the "foreign case" and "confirmed case" diagnosis, we recommend following and obeying the latest guidance in each country.
Our team will also update our guidance on a number of occasions as a help.
Bangladesh reported five new deaths from COVID-19, the highest daily death count
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19 that day.
This is the highest death rate in one day because of the virus.
Until yesterday, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) Bangladesh reported the number of cases of infections reported including 114 active cases and 33 home-based cases.
Totally 17 deaths.
In a tacit online news, IEDCR director, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said death involves four men and a woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases over 60 years old, two cases between 51 and 60 years old, and one case between 41 and 50 years old.
He also said two victims were from Dhaka.
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news office, that one of the people who died was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, who was treated at the Maitree Hospital Kuwaiti Hospital.
On Saturday, in a online video announcement, Minister of Road Transport and Bridges, the Obaidu Quader said that public transportation would be stopped longer than originally planned, until next Saturday.
This public transport stop has started since March 26th and is scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transport of basic necessities -- medical, fuel, and food -- is still allowed.
The first COVID-19 infection incident in Bangladesh was on March 8, in two people who had just returned from Italy and also the wife of one of them.
On March 19, the three men recovered from illness.
SARS-CoV-2 infection exceeds one million worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronary infection exceeded one million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
At least 52,000 deaths are associated with COVID-19, a disease caused by the coronary virus.
The peak occurred on the same day when Malawi confirmed its first coronary virus infection and Zambia experienced its first death related to the crown virus.
North Korea claims, on Thursday, that the country is one of the few countries that remain free of the infection of the virus.
Until yesterday, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in twenty-four hours since 10 a.m. Central European Time (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases are reported, resulting in at least 5,900 deaths.
The CBS News Office reports, which quotes Johns Hopkins University data, there are more than 1,000 deaths in the U.S. caused by coronary infection.
Around the world, countries announce stronger actions to hinder the spread of disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, Moscow’s mayor, extended quarantine until May 1.
Nationalally, President Vladimir Putin stated that Russians would remain paid without having to go to work until April 30.
The Portuguese parliament took a vote to extend the national emergency status for 15 days; the vote passed with 215 votes supporting, ten abstaining, and one voice refused.
Saudi Arabia extended the hours of night in the holy city of Mecca and Madinah until all day long; before, it was only between 3:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m.
Thailand plans to apply nighttime between 10 a.m. and 4 a.m.
Governor Ohio, Mike DeWine, announced that the state had extended the house order until May 1st.
Shops in Australia lower the purchase of toilet tissue per transaction
On Sunday and Saturday afternoon, the Australian Woolworth and Coles stores each lowered the cost of buying toilet tissue to two and one pack per transaction at all national level.
ALDI also applied the one-sir limit, on Monday.
This restriction was announced as a message on the casino and on the Facebook page of its network.
The buyers were reported to collect supplies due to fear of COVID-19 if the public had to do solitary isolation.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also restricts the purchase of toilet tissue for home delivery to one pack per order.
This change followed the four-steel restriction per previous transaction applied to Woolworths and Coles each on March 4 and 5.
In his statement on March 8th, Coles reported that with the restriction of the four packs, "many stores are still running out within an hour since delivery," and said the request "never happened before", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it "unforeseen".
The sale "higher" last week, according to one of Woolworths' speakers.
Costco store in Canberra also limits the number allowed until two packs last week.
To avoid misappropriation, Coles ordered more packaging than customers and increased delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered additional supplies, while ALDI made provision for special Wednesday promotion activities available earlier.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Peritel Association, said that the experiment was trying to increase supplies, but the limitations of the local government for the time the truck delivery made it difficult.
He anticipates rising production costs, while the buyer tries to meet demands, and fewer special promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that since it had released early supplies, some stores could not hold special Wednesdays.
In a News.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert from Queensland University of Technology, says the store fills supplies every night.
He stressed that toilet tissue is a large volume so that its supply is low and, if sold, it makes a lot of empty space in the shelves so that the scarcity of goods becomes more felt.
Coles and Woolworths consider that if there's a lot of stuff on the shelf, if products such as toilet tissue and sanitation can be [bought] and there's a large amount, the panic may be minimized, Russel Zimmerman will use through the ABC News Office.
The production of a new toilet tissue Who Gives a Crap said on Wednesday that they were out of supplies.
Kimberly-Clark, who made this Kleinex Toilet, and Solaris Paper, who made Sorbent, pressured them to work 24/7 to keep supply, reports News.com.au.
Domain.com, a real state site, reports that some property vendors offer free toiletries to the first auction tenderer in Melbourne, when less auctions are held because buyers take breaks for long vacations at the end of Labor Day.
Thursday NT News, a newspaper printed in Darwin, included eight pages of the front page for cutting and using as a toilet tissue.
Stores are actually refusing to apply restrictions, according to ABC Australia's report on March 3, they say they're not planning to apply the purchase limits.
Russell Zimmerman adds that other products are also in high demand, including masks, sanitation, dry food, handwashing soap, and flour.
Similarly, on Sunday afternoon British supermarket Ocado was observed limiting the purchase of Andres’ toilet tissue to two packs of 12 rolls.
World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the disease COVID-19 that is happening—the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2—as a pandemic.
Although the word "pandem" refers only to how widespread the disease has spread, not how dangerous the case is, WHO notes the need to motivate the government to act:
All countries can still change this pandemic journey.
If the country detects, tests, handles, isolates, and mobilizes its people as a response, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director General WHO.
We were very concerned about the extent of the preaching work and the extent of the distress, as well as the level of the fear - inspiring action.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the United States Disease Control and Prevention Center, this pandemic "has never happened before."
He said, in a report published by CNN in February, "other than influenza, there is no respiratory virus that has ever been traced from its onset to its continued global spread."
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying "we've never seen a pandemic triggered by coronavirus."
He continued, "and we have never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time."
The new pandemic status followed WHO’s decision in January that described this plague as a disintegration of the world’s society.
Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease of the United States, Dr. Anthony Faucci, said about this plague, "the disease is going to get worse."
Until Thursday, the Associated Press reported at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
Pandemi coronavirus 2019-2020 is a pandemic coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) that is continuing and caused by coronavirus acute breathing syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, Tiongkok, in December 2019, as a Globally Health-Relief Facility on January 30, 2020, and was declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
By 10 April 2020, some 1.61 million COVID-19 cases had been reported in 210 countries and territorial areas, resulting in about 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
The number of fatalities is estimated to be 4% in Thailand, while the whole world is ranging from 13.04% to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and wheezing.
Complications can cover pneumonia and acute respiratory failure syndrome.
Time from the appearance of the symptoms to the adjournment in general for about five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
No known vaccine or specific antivirus treatment yet.
The recommended preventive action includes washing hands, closing mouths while coughing, keeping away from others, and monitoring and isolation separately for those who are suspected to be infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by doing travel, quarantine, night hours, hazardous workplaces, and closures.
This pandemic has caused severe global economic disruptions, delays or cancellations of cultural, political, religious, sports, and the extent to which supplies of goods are seriously affected by the purchase of panic.
Schools and universities have been closed both nationally and locally in 193 countries, which affect about 99.4 percent of the world’s students.
Misinformation on this virus has spread online and there are incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against the Tionghoa people, people with descendants and appearances of East and Southeast Asia, and people from the area with significant virus cases.
Due to a decrease in travel and heavy industrial closures, air pollution and carbon emissions are dropping.
Health authorities in Wuhan, Tiongkok (Hubei province) report a cluster of cases of pneumonia with unknown causes on December 31, 2019 and research done early January 2020.
These cases are mostly related to the wholesale John Seafood Market and therefore the virus is expected to have zoonotic origin.
A virus that causes a disease called SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered and related virus with bat coronavirus, ratting coronavirus, and SARS-CoV. The first person with symptoms then became ill on December 1, 2019, and the person has no clear connection to the wet market cluster mentioned below.
Between the initial case cluster reported in December 2019, two-thirds found had something to do with the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post estimated that a case that could be traced to November 17, 2019, at a 55-year-old from the Province of Hubei, was likely the first. On February 26, 2020, WHO reported that, with a new case reported down in Tyeongkok, but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside of Tyeongkok has exceeded the number of new cases in Tyeongkok for the first time.
There may be a large number of unreported cases, especially among people with lighter symptoms.
Until 26 February, a relatively small number of cases reported among young people, with 19-year-olds below forming 2.4% cases worldwide. British scientific advisor Patrick Vallance estimates that 60% of the British population need to be infected before the immunity of the group can be achieved.
The case refers to the number of people who have been tested COVID-19 and the results of their tests have been confirmed positive according to the official protocol.
By March 23, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries have made official policy not to test people with mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that until January 23th, there were an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections undetected, and that this undocumented infection was the source of infection for 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimates that the number of infections in Italy is estimated to be greater than the reported case.
Initial estimate of the basic reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 is 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the United States Disease Control and Prevention Center concluded that the number is likely to be 5.7.
Most COVID-19 sufferers are cured.
For those who do not recover, time from the onset of symptoms to death between 6 and 41 days, with the most common 14 days.
Since April 10, 2020, about 97,000 deaths have been linked to COVID-19.
In Thailand, up to 5 February, about 80% of deaths occur in people over 60 years of age and 75% have a health disorder that has already existed, which covers cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and official death calculations by the COVID-19 pandemic generally refer to people who have died who have tested positive for COVID according to official protocol.
The actual mortality rate from COVID-19 may be much higher, since official numbers may not include those who died without being tested, for example, at home, at home, at home, at home, dsb.
Partial data from Italy found that the excess number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID death calculations by factor 4-5 times.
A female spokesperson for the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted, "We know [the number of deaths announced] is lower than the actual number," a statement reinforced by a non-scientific report on the U.S. account is too low. Too low estimates often appear in pandemics, as in the H1N1 flu epidemic of 2009. The first death confirmed was in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside the mainland occurred on February 1, in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia was in France on February 14.
Until 28 February, outside the mainland, more than a dozen deaths were recorded each in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
By March 13th, more than forty countries and territories reported death on every continent except Antarctica.
The number varies according to the region and over time, and is influenced by the number of tests, the quality of the health care system, the treatment options, the time since the first outbreak, and the population character such as age, gender, and health as a whole.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the death ratio against cases globally is 6.0% (97.039/1.617.204) for 10 April 2020.
This number varies according to the area.
In Tokyo, the ratio of death to the case decreased by 17.3% (for people with 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for people with 1-10 January 2020) (for people with 1 February 2020). Another increase covers the fatality rate of the case (CFR), which reflects the percentage of people diagnosed who died from certain diseases, and the fatality rate of infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of those infected (diagnosis and undiagnosis) who died from certain diseases.
This statistic is not time-bound and follows a certain population from infection to case resolution.
A number of academics have tried to count these numbers for certain populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine University of Oxford estimates the mortality rate of infection for the whole pandemic between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The limit of this estimate is based on the result of the first random test for COVID-19 in Germany and a statistical investigation that analyses the impact of the test on the CFR estimate.
WHO confirms that this pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and end of this plague are unclear and may differ according to location.
Maciej Boni from Penn State University states: "Without being controlled, the outbreak usually occurs and then begins to decrease when the disease runs out of available water.
However, it is almost impossible to make a reasonable projection at the moment about when that happens."
Senior government medical advisor Tyeongkok Zhong Nanshan argued that "this plague may end June" if the entire country can be mobilized to follow WHO's advice on the rare steps to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine stated that SRS-CoV-2 "will continue to leave, probably up to a year or two."
According to Imperial College research led by Neil Ferguson, physical limitations and other steps will be necessary "so that vaccine is available (maybe 18 months or more).
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University states, "I think it's a small possibility that this coronavirus, because it's very easy to transmit, can disappear entirely" and this disease "maybe turned into a seasonal disease, which comes back every year."
The repeat virulence will depend on the immunity of the group and the level of mutation.
The COVID-19 symptoms can be relatively unspecified and the infected can be without symptoms.
Two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and cough (68%).
Uncommon symptoms include fatigue, respiratory sputum production (flegma), loss of smell, wheezing, joint and muscle pain, sore throat, headache, shivering, vomiting, hemoptissis, diarrhea, or hanosis. WHO states that about one in six people is seriously ill and has difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) contains an emergency symptom covering breathing difficulties, chest pressure or chest pain settles, sudden confusion, walking difficulties, and dizziness on the face and lips; medical attention is immediately advised if these symptoms occur. Further disease development can be severe pneumonia, acute respiratory syndrome, sepsis, septic shock, and death.
Some people who are infected may be asymptomatic, that is, without clinical symptoms, but with test results that confirm infection, therefore, researchers suggest that those close to those who are confirmed to be infected should be monitored closely and checked to ensure that they are not infected.
The Tionghoa estimated an asymptomatic ratio ranging from a few to 44%.
The period of incubation (time between infection and avertite) usually ranges between 1 and 14 days, most often 5 days. For example, the number of COVID-19 sufferers who lost the smell power at the beginning of 30%, then decreased to 15%.
The details of how the disease spread are still being studied.
COVID-19 service is believed mainly to occur in close contact time and through small droplets produced during coughing, sneezing, or speaking; close contact is contact within 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Research found that unsealed cough can cause droplets to be pushed 4.5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some researchers estimate that the virus may also be transmitted by a small droplet that survives longer in the air and is produced when speaking. Breath droplets can also be produced when breathing, including when talking, although this virus is generally not transmitted through the air.
Droplet can fall into the mouth or nose of someone nearby or maybe breathe into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and resuscitation of the heart (RJP), can make the secret of breathing change into aerosols and spread through the air.
The ministry can also happen when a person touches contaminated surfaces, including skin, and then touches the eyes, nose, and mouth.
Although there is concern that the virus can spread through feces, this risk is believed to be low.
The government of the Tingkok is able to transmit SARS-CoV-2 faecally.The most contagious virus in the first three days after the onset of the symptoms, although the spread may occur before the symptoms appear and at the stage of further disease.
People give positive test results up to three days before the symptoms, which imply transmission may occur before significant symptoms.
Only a few asymptomatic reports confirmed by the laboratory, but asymptomatic transmissions have been identified by some countries during the investigation of contacts.
The European Disease Prevention and Control Centre (ECDC) states that although it is not fully clear how easily this disease spreads, one person usually infects two to three others, and it can survive on the surface for hours to days.
Specifically, it has been found that the virus can be detected for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 carbon-resistant steel, one day on cardboard, and more than four hours on copper.
However, this varies depending on the humidity and temperature.
There is no evidence that animals can spread viruses to humans, although the British authorities suggest washing hands after contact with animals, such as after contact with surfaces that may have been touched by infected people.
Koronavirus acute acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, first isolated from three pneumonia sufferers associated with acute respiratory disease cluster in Wuhan.
All the features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are related to the coronavirus in nature. Outside the human body, this virus can be destroyed if it is exposed to household soap, which disrupts its protective envelope.
The virus is estimated to have zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis reveals that the genetically cloistered coronavirus with the genus Betacronavirus, in the subgenus Sarbecovirus (the offspring of B) together with two gallus of bats.
This virus has 96% in the whole genome level with other bats' (batCov RatG13) coronavirus samples.
In February 2020, researchers found that there was only one difference between amino acid in certain parts of the genome between the Tengilling virus and the human virus.
So far, the entire genome comparison has found the most 92% of the genetic material similarity between the coronavirus and the SARS-CoV-2, not enough to prove that the epitome is the ring between the SARS-CoV-2.
Virus infection can be diagnosed temporarily based on symptoms, but confirmation is ultimately done by reaction of the polymerase chain back transcription (rRT-PCR) on secret infected or controlling CT imaging.
A study comparing PCR with CT in Wuhan showed that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, but less specific, with the number of imaging features that are consistent with pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "CT should not be used for coating or as the first line test in the diagnosis of COVID-19."
WHO has published some RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, which was first released on January 17.
Test using the reaction chain polymerase back transcription real-time (rRT-PCR).
Tests can be performed on breath samples or blood samples.
The results are generally available in a few hours to a few days.
Generally, this test is performed on nasopharyngus, but the throat wipes can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests that detect antibodies.
On April 6, 2020, none of these serological tests proved sufficiently accurate to approve its extensive use.
In the U.S., the serological test developed by Cellex has been approved for emergency use, only by a laboratory certified.
Characteristic radiography and computed tomography (CT) features in people who are symptomatic include the surface opacity of the perifer asymmetry glass and no pleural effusion.
Italian Radiological Society is building an international network database for a search for a confirmed case.
Because it is associated with other infections such as adenovirus, unconfirmed PCR imaging has limited specificity in identifying COVID-19.
A major study in Tiongkok compared chest CT results with PCR and showed that although less specific to infection, imaging is faster and more sensitive and is suggested to be considered as an epidemiologic remedy.
The neural networks of artificial intelligence-based convolution have been developed to detect virus imaging features with X-ray and CT.
The strategy to prevent the spread of this disease involves keeping personal hygiene neatly clean, washing hands, avoiding eye contact, nose, or mouth before washing hands, and wearing tissue while coughing or sneezing and immediately throwing tissue into trash.
People who may have been infected are advised to wear surgical masks in public.
It is also recommended that governments in various regions restrict or urge to stop all non-essential journeys to and from countries and regions affected by the epidemic.
However, the virus has reached the level of population spread in most parts of the world.
This means that the virus has spread in society, and some members of society do not know where or how they are infected, and the health care provider who handles those who may be infected is advised to do standard prevention, contact prevention, and eye protection, and contact tracking is an important step for the health authority to determine the source of infection and prevent further transmission.
The use of the location data from the phones by the government for this purpose has triggered a privacy issue, with the release of a statement from Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations calling for such a restriction of surveillance.
Cellular applications have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and on April 7, 2020, more than one dozen expert groups are working on privacy friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record user distance to other phones.
Next, the user will receive a message if they are close to someone who is tested positive for COVID-19.It turns out to be a misunderstanding about how to prevent infection; for example, chewing noses and collapsing with ineffective fungal drugs.
There's not yet a COVID-19 vaccine, although many organizations are working to develop it.
Washing your hands is recommended to prevent the spread of disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands often with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after the toilet or when the hand looks dirty; before eating; and after the nose, cough, or sneezing.
This encouragement is because, outside the human body, the virus was killed by household soap that damaged its protective layer.
In addition, the CDC recommends the use of alcohol - based hand sanitation with alcohol at least 60% based on volume when soap and water are not available.
WHO encourages people not to touch the eyes, nose, or mouth before washing hands.
Surfaces can be decontaminated using a number of lanterns (in one minute disinfection for carbon-resistant steel surfaces), including ethanol 62–71%, isopropanol 50–100%, sodium hypochlorite 0.1%, hydrogen peroxide 0.5%, and povidone-iodine 0.2–7.5%.
Other pathways, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidin glukonate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if there are expected or confirmed COVID cases in public facilities, such as the office or place of child care, all areas such as office, bathroom, public area, electronic equipment together such as tablet, touch screen, keyboard, remote control, and ATM machines used by sufferers, should be disinfected.
The health organization recommends that people cover their mouths and noses with elbows that are bent or using tissue when coughing or sneezing, and then immediately throw away tissue.
The surgical marker recommended for people who may have been infected because wearing masks can limit the volume and time length of the espirator droplets that are dispersed when speaking, sneezing, and coughing.
WHO has issued instructions on mask time and way of wearing.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Using masks can reduce the tendency of people to touch their faces with hands that are not clean enough, which is the main source of delivery."
WHO recommends the use of masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, such as those who treat COVID-19 sufferers, although WHO also acknowledges that wearing masks can help prevent people from touching their faces.
Some countries have already begun to encourage the use of masks to members of society.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends the use of non-medisal face masks made of cloth. Specifically, Tyeongkok recommends the use of medical masks once used to healthy people, especially when close to (1 meters (3 feet) or less) with others.
Hong Kong recommended surgical masking when using public transportation or living in a large area.
Thailand’s health officer encourages people to make cloth masks at home and wash them every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia prevent its people from going out to public places without wearing masks or covering their noses and mouths.
On March 16, Vietnam asked all its citizens to wear face masks while going to the public to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government requires everyone who enters the towel to wear a face mask.
Israel asked all its citizens to wear face masks when they were in public.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks a day since mid - March, obliges train passengers and intercity buses to wear face masks for April 1.
Panama obliges the use of face masks every time out of the house, as well as recommending the manufacture of face masks for those who cannot buy face masks.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social limitations (also referred to as physical limitations) are an act of control of the infection that is meant to slow the spread of disease by minimizing close contact between individuals.
Social restrictions include quarantine; travel restrictions; and school closures, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, or shopping malls.
People can apply social exclusion methods by living at home, restricting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using contactless greetings, and keeping the physical distance from others.
Today, many governments require or demand social restrictions in areas affected by the scourge.
The maximum number of people assembled recommended by U.S. government bodies and health organizations is reduced rapidly, starting from 250 people (if not known at the COVID-19 level in a region) to 50 people, and then to 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned meetings in public areas involving more than two people. Age and people with a medical condition based on diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and an immune system that had a serious risk of disease and higher complications suggested that the CDC should only be at home in areas where there is a disease at the level of society. By the end of March 2020, WHO and other health agencies began to replace the use of the term "social limitations" to "physical limitations", to clarify that its purpose is to reduce physical contact by maintaining social relations, either virtual or from a distance.
The use of the term "social limitations" suggests that people must isolate themselves completely socially and do not encourage people to stay in contact with others through alternative means.
This recommendation includes the encouragement to have sex only with people who live with you and have no virus or virus symptoms.
Isolation alone at home recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those suspected to be infected.
And many governments require or recommend independent quarantine for the entire population living in the affected area.
Quarantine's strictest independent instruction is given to people who include high risk groups.
The person who may have been exposed to COVID-19 and the person who recently traveled to the country or region with a large COVID-19 spread is advised to do quarantine alone for 14 days since the last possible date of the exposure.
The strategy in the control of the epidemic is shelter or suppression, as well as mitigation.
Remedies are carried out at the early stages of the outbreak and are aimed at tracking and isolating infected people and taking other steps to control infections and vaccines aimed at stopping the spread of disease to the entire population.
When it is no longer possible to prevent the spread of disease, the next effort will be directed to the stage of mitigation: these steps will be taken to slow the spread and reduce its impact on health care systems and society.
The combination of shelter and mitigation can be done at the same time.
The suppression requires more extreme steps to reverse the pandemic by reducing the number of basic reproductions to less than 1. The extent of the management of infectious disease epidemics is to try to bring down the top of the epidemic, known as the epidemic curve.
It lowers the risk of overcompensation in health care and gives more time for vaccine development and treatment.
The non-pharmaceutical intervention to deal with the plague involves individual prevention, such as hand-cleaning, wearing facial masks, and independent quarantine; steps at the level of society aimed at physical restraint, such as closing schools and cancelling mass meeting events; the public engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; and steps at the level of the environment, such as surface cleaning; and other drastic actions aimed at preventing the plague being carried out at the time of the outbreak, as well as the fact that the whole of the city is facing a strict road ban.
Other countries also apply various steps aimed at restricting the spread of viruses.
South Korea introduces local mass suppression and quarantine, and warns about the movement of infected people.
Singapore provides financial support for infected people who do quarantine independently and hold a huge fine for those who fail to do so.
Taiwan increases the production of face masks and punishes medical supplies. Simulations for Britain and the United States show that mitigating (slow, but not stopping the spread of epidemics) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) has a major challenge.
Optimum mitigation policies can reduce the peak demand for health care to 2/3 and death to half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and poor health systems.
Suppression can be selected, but it needs to be maintained while the virus is still circulating in the human population (or until the vaccine is available, if this is first achieved), because otherwise, the transmission will jump back quickly when the suppression steps are slowed down.
Long-term intervention to pressure pandemics has an impact on social and economics.
There is not yet any specific anti-virus drugs approved for COVID-19, but development efforts are under way, including existing drug testing.
Taking free - selling flu drugs, drinking enough water, and rest can help ease symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and respiratory support may be needed.
Steroid use can make patients worse.
Some previously approved compounds for the treatment of another virus disease are being investigated for use in COVID-19.
WHO also states that some "traditional and home abuse" can ease symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO said that increasing capacity and adapting health services to the needs of COVID-19 patients was a basic step in responding to the epidemic.
ECDC and the European regional WHO office have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health services to divert resources at various levels, including focusing on laboratory services for COVID-19 testing, if it is possible to cancel elective procedures, separate and isolate positive COVID-19 patients, and improve intensive care capacity through personal training and increase the number of fans and beds.
There are various theories about the origin of the first case (called zero patients).
The first known case of coronavirus can be traced to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, Tiongkok.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased.
These cases are largely related to the Deep Sea Market of the Sea of John, which also sells live animals, and one theory says that the virus comes from one of these types of animals; or, in other words, the virus has zoonotic origin; a cluster of pneumonia with unknown causes observed on December 26th and handled by Dr. Zhang Jixian at Hubei Province Hospital, which told the CDC Jianghan Wuhan on December 27th.
On December 30, a group of doctors at the Wuhan Center Hospital told their colleagues about the "coronavirus looks like SARS".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were warned by the police about spreading false rumors, and the others, Ai Fen, were reproved by his superiors for warning.
The Wuhan City Health Commission then issued an announcement to the public on December 31st and told WHO.
Enough cases of unknown pneumonia were reported to the Wuhan health authority, which then triggered an investigation early in January, and at the beginning of the outbreak, the number of cases increased twice every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spreads to other provinces, supported by migration during the New Year's Illek and because Wuhan is the center of transportation and the main train transit.
On January 20, Tiongkok reported almost 140 new cases a day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
The following official data shows that 6,174 people have experienced symptoms on January 20, 2020.On March 26, the United States has surpassed Thailand and Italy with the highest confirmed cases in the world. By April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; over 97,000 people have died in the world and over 364,000 have been cured.
Some 200 countries and territorial territories have at least one case.

On the other hand, Tiongkok's assistance was well received in some parts of Latin America and Africa, and on April 2, the World Bank launched an emergency support operation for developing countries.
WHO praised the efforts of the government of Tiongkok in managing and building epidemics.
WHO noted the difference between SARS outbreaks in 2002-2004 when Tiongkok's authority was accused of closing and hindering efforts to prevent and shelter and crisis at this time with central government "giving a routine update to avoid panic approaching the New Year's Illek holiday".
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central government that applied the ban on transport in Wuhan, the representative of WHO Gauden Galea said that although it was "not clearly recommended by WHO," but it was also "a very important indication for committing epidemics in the most concentrated place of the epidemic" and he called it "never before in the history of society's health".On 30 January, after the confirmation of human transmission to humans outside of Tiongkok and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO declared this outbreak as the World Health Care Emergency (PHEIC), which is the sixth PHEIC since its first treatment during the 2009 Babylonian flu pandemic.
Director General WHO Tedros Adhanom says that PHEIC is stated because there is "a risk of global spread, especially to low and middle-income countries that have not yet had a complex health system.
Responding to travel restrictions, Tedros states that "there is no reason to take steps to disrupt international travel and trade unnecessarily" and "WHO does not recommend trade and movement restrictions."
On 5 February, WHO called on global society to contribute $675 million worth of money to fund strategic needs in low-income countries, mentioning the urgency to support countries that "have no system to detect people infected with viruses."
Moreover, Tedros made a statement that "the limit of our strength is in the weakest chain" and urged international society to "invest today or pay more in later days."At the press conference on February 11, WHO set COVID-19 as the name of the disease for this virus.
On the same day, Tedros stated that Secretary General António Guterres had agreed to give "the view that the entire power of the United Nations system is being eroded".
Then, the United Nations activated the Crisis Management Team to enable coordination of the entire United Nations response, which according to WHO would enable them to "focus on health responses, while other institutions could use their expertise to deal with the impact of epidemics in social, economic, and broader development."
On 14 February, a Joint Mission Team with Tionkok led by WHO was activated; this team aims to provide energy international experts and WHO in Tionkok in order to assist domestic management and evaluate "the severity and disease spread rate" by holding office and meeting with the national authorities related to it and to undertake field visits to assess "the impact of disruption activities at the provincial and county levels, which include urban and rural settings."On 25 February, WHO stated that "the world must do more to prepare for the possibility of coronary pandemics" and said that, although it is still too early to call it pandemics, countries should remain "in the ready phase".
Responding to an epidemic that developed in Iran, WHO sent the Joint Mission Team there to assess the situation. On February 28, WHO officials said that the assessment of the global threat of coronary disease would be raised from "high" to "very high", this is the highest level of caution and risk assessment.
In a statement, Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO's health-care programs, warned that, "It's time for every government on this planet to face reality: stay awake.
This virus may come to your place and you must be ready," and insists that the right step of the strike can help the world avoid "the worst".
Further, Ryan states that the current data does not allow the public health official to declare a global pandemic, and says that such a declaration means "basically we accept that every human on this planet will be exposed to the virus."
On March 11, WHO declared the outbreak of coronavirus as a pandemic.
Director General WHO says that WHO "very concerned about the level of spread and distress, and the level of fear of the action." WHO accepts harsh criticism because it is not judged fit to handle pandemics, which includes delay in declaring the public health emergency and classifying the virus as pandemics.
One of the strong reactions included a petition signed by 733,000 people per 6 April, addressed to Director General WHO Tedros Adhanom for his resignation.
On March 26, 2020, dozens of UN HAM experts stressed respect for each individual's rights during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Experts argue that every individual has the right to health, including disabled people, minority groups, old age, internal refugees, homeless people, those living in very poor conditions, people in prisons, refugees, and other groups in need of government support.
The international government organization is trying to address the social and economic impact of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Economic and Development Cooperation Organization has launched a program to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, along with perspectives and suggestions.

The Tiongkok government received criticism from the United States, British Cabinet Minister Michael Gove, and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's son Eduardo Bolsonaro of the early pandemic in the Province of Hubei, Tiongkok.
A number of provincial administrators of the Tiongkok Communist Party (CPC) have been discontinued in connection with quarantine management in central central Thailand, which is a sign of dissatisfaction with the political agency’s response to the epidemic in the region.
Some commentators believe that this step is meant to protect the Secretary-General of the Communist Party Tiongkok Xi Jinping from public anger related to the outbreak of coronavirus.
Some Tiongkok officials, such as Zhao Lijian, rejected the earlier admission of the Coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, and supported the conspiracy theory of COVID-19 from the U.S. or Italy.
The U.S. government Donald Trump called coronavirus "Tionkok virus" or "Wuhan virus" and said that "Tionkok's closed action empowers the virus that is now turned into a global pandemic." This word is ultimately criticized by a number of critics as racism and "distorting attention from its government failure to deal with crown viruses."
The Daily Beast received an U.S. government message that outlined the communication strategy and clearly originated at the National Security Council, with the strategy quoted as "All about Tiongkok.
We were told to try and deliver this message in any way possible, including press conferences and television shows."Media such as Politics, Foreign Policy, and Bloomberg claimed that the attempt to send aid to affected countries is part of the propaganda push to influence the world.
Chief of Foreign Policy of the European Union Josep Borrell warns that there is "geo-political group, which includes fighting to gain influence through the reversal of the fact and 'political generosity'."
Borrell also said that, "Aggressively pushes the message that, unlike the United States, they are responsible and reliable partners."
Thiongkok also called for the US to remove sanctions against Syria, Venezuela, and Iran, and to send aid to the last two countries.
Jack Ma's contribution was 100,000 masks for Cuba blocked by U.S. sanctions on April 3.
The U.S. authorities are also accused of diverting aid from other countries to their own countries.
There are also disputes related to masks reported among other countries, such as Germany, Austria, and Switzerland; and the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey took hundreds of fans intended for Spain.
At the beginning of March, the Italian government criticized the lack of solidarity between the European Union and the Italian coronavirus.
Maurizio Massari, the Italian ambassador for the European Union, said that "Only Tiongkok responded bilaterally.
Of course, this is not a sign of European solidarity."
On March 22, after receiving a phone call from Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin directed the Russian army to send military medical power, special disinfection vehicles, and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quotes "high-level political sources" anonymously saying that 80 percent of Russia's aid "is useless or of little use for Italy."
The source accuses Russia of a "geopolitic and diplomatic" attack.
President Lombardy, Attilio Fontana, and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi In May ignored the media report and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent cargo planes with medical aid to the United States.
The spokesperson Kremlin Dmitry Peskov says that "when offering help to fellow Americans in the United States, [Putin] assumes that if U.S. equipment and medical materials producers get opportunity, they will also be able to repay if necessary."
NATO military training "Defender 2020" planned in Germany, Poland, and the Baltic countries, namely the largest NATO war training since the end of the Cold War, will be held on a smaller scale.
Secretary General Campaign Kate Hudson's Nuclear Delicting Campaign criticises the Defence 2020 training: "In the current public health crisis, this training not only endangers the lives of US troops and many participating European countries but also the people of the country where they operate."The Iranian rule is heavily affected by this virus, with about two dozen members of the parliament infected with fifteen political figures today or before.
On 14 March 2020, President Iran Hassan Rouhani wrote an open letter to the leaders of the world to ask for help and said that his country was struggling to fight the plague because of lack of access to the international market as a result of the United States sanctions against Iran. This plague has prompted the United States to adopt a common social policy in other rich countries, including universal health care, universal child care, paid family leave, and higher levels of funding for the health of the public.
Political analysts suspect this can have a negative impact on Donald Trump's opportunity to be re-elected in the election of President 2020, and diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea are worsening due to this pandemic.
South Korea criticises "the ambiguous and passive Japanese quarantine" after Japan announces that everyone who comes from South Korea will be placed in quarantine two weeks at a designated government location.
Initially, South Korean society's shared views relate to President Moon Jae-in's response to this crisis.
Many Koreans have signed a petition, either calling for Moon's relief, on the basis of their claim about the government's error in dealing with the plague, or praising its response, and allowing many countries to respond.
Some commentators expressed concern that it could enable the government to strengthen its grip on power.
In Hungary, his parliament chose to allow the Prime Minister, Viktor Orbán, to rule through timeless decrees, to postpone parliament and the public elections, and to punish people who are believed to spread false information about the virus and the government's crisis management.
Coronavirus outbreaks are affected by lack of supply, which stems from the increase in the use of equipment globally to fight the plague, the purchase due to panic, and the disruption of factory and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Superintendents are warning about the lack of drugs and medical equipment due to increased demand for consumption and disruption.
Some areas also suffered from panic resulting in a lack of basic needs, such as food, toilet tissue, and bottled water, which led to lack of supply.
In particular, the technology industry has warned about the delay in the delivery of electronic goods.
According to general director who Tedros Adhanom, the demand for safety devices increases by 100 times.
This request increases prices to twentyfold normal prices and triggers delays in medical supplies for four to six months.
It also causes a lack of self - protection around the world, and WHO warns that it will endanger health.
In Australia the pandemic presented a new opportunity for Customs to sell Australia’s products in Beijing.
This led to a lack of milk formula in some supermarkets and was finally banned by the Australian government, despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in Northern Italy and Wuhan regions, and the high demand for food products, two areas were avoided from food shortages.
The Tiongkok and Italy's steps against the illegal enrichment and trade of important products succeed so that the anticipated lack of accurate food will occur in Europe and North America can be prevented.
Northern Italy, with its large crop production, has not experienced significant decline, but prices can increase according to industry representatives.
The empty food racks were only found temporarily, even in Wuhan, with government officials in the city removing pigmeat reserves to ensure that the population's diet was adequate.
Similar invitations also exist in Italy, which obliges food producers to keep backups for such an emergency.
The global economic decline has been felt in Thailand: according to the media report on March 16, the economy in Thailand was severely hit in the first two months of 2020 by the government's steps to curb the spread of viruses, and the sale of anjlok reptiles of 20.5%.
Because the mainland is a major economic center and manufacture, the virus epidemic is thought to pose a major threat of destabilization against the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit estimates that the market will continue to move forward until there is a clearer picture of the potential end result.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the impact of the epidemic on global growth could exceed SARS epidemics in 2002-2004.
An estimate from Washington University at St. Louis states that the plague has impacted more than $300 billion on the global supply chain, which can last up to two years.

On 27 February, due to increased concern about the coronavirus epidemic, various U.S. stock indexes, including NASDAQ-100, S&P index 500, and Dow Jones Industrial Avage, recorded the sharp decline since 2008, with Dow falling 1,191 points, the decline of one day since the financial crisis in 2007–2008.
The three stock indexes closed the week with a decrease of more than 10%.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed the Tiongkok government credit rating, but maintained Outlook Negative.
Stocks are again due to fear of coronavirus, the biggest decrease occurred on March 16.
Many people think that economic recession may happen.
Econom Mohamed El-Erian praised the urgent steps of the central bank and the state of the country on time.
The central bank reacted faster than they did during the 2008 monetary crisis.
Tourism is one of the most severe sectors affected by travel bans, the closure of public places include travel sites, and government actions that restrict travel worldwide.
As a result, many airlines cancelled the flight because of few requests, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Qantas, while British airline Flybe collapsed.
The impact on the shipping industry is on levels that have never been seen before.
Some railway stations and ferry terminals have also been closed.
Epidemics coincided with Chunyun, the main travel season related to the holiday of New Year's Illek.
A number of events involving many people were cancelled by central and local governments, including annual New Year's Festival Illek, and private companies also independently closed stores and tourist sites, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many New Year’s Illek events and travel sites were closed to prevent mass gatherings, including the Forbidden City of Beijing and the traditional temple exhibits.
In 24 out of 31 provinces, the city of Madya, and the territory of Thungkok, authorities extended the New Year’s Eve until 10 February and ordered most jobs not to be reopened until that date.
These areas are 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong increased the incidence of infectious diseases to the highest level and announced emergency conditions, closed school until March, and cancelled New Year's celebrations. The retail sector is affected globally by a decrease in working hours or temporary closures.
Visits to farmers in Europe and Latin America have dropped by 40%.
North American and Middle East residents experienced 50–60% decline.
This also resulted in a decrease in 33-43% of traffic on foot to the shopping center in March compared to February.
It is estimated that the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America will increase the number of people in extreme poverty in Latin America from 14 to 22 million compared to the situation without pandemics.
In January and February 2020, during the peak epidemic in Wuhan, some 5 million people in Tibet lost their jobs.
By March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government aid.
According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the coronavirus epidemic could cause 47 million jobs lost in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32%. The region's quarantine in India caused tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (paid by daily wages) to retire. Angus Reid Institute's survey found that 44% of Canadian households had lost their jobs. Nearly 900,000 workers had lost their jobs in Spain since treatment of forty-one regions in mid-March 2020.
During the two-month period of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary employment and 1 million British workers submitted a universal credit scheme, and almost half a million companies in Germany submitted short-term work schemes to the government for their employees, called Kurzarbeit.
German short-term compensation scheme was adopted by France and England.
Throughout the world, the arts and cultural heritage sector is greatly affected by the pandemic, which affects the operation of both organizations and individuals, both employed and self - employed.
The arts and culture organizations strive to uphold their mission (which is often publicly funded) to provide cultural heritage access to the public, to ensure the safety of employees and the public, and to support artists if possible.
In March 2020, around the world and at different levels, museums, libraries, show venues, and other cultural institutions were closed without time, with exhibitions, shows, and shows cancelled or postponed.
In response, intensive efforts are being made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. The impact of other recent and very fast-growing diseases is the denial of religious services, major sports events, and other social events, such as music and concert festivals, technology conferences, and clothing trades.
The film industry was also disturbed, and the Vatican announced that the celebration of the Holy Week in Rome, which had fallen in the last week of the Christian Repentance season, had been cancelled.
Many confessions encourage the elderly Christians to stay at home and not attend Mass on Sundays; some churches provide church services by radio, direct online or television, while others offer drive-in worship or upbringing.
With the closure of the church and chapel by the Roman Catholic diocese and the removal of St. Peter's Square from the Christian pilgrimages, other religious bodies also cancel the service and restrict public meetings in the church, the mosque, the synagogue, the temples, and the gurdwara.
Iran's Ministry of Health announced Friday's cancellation in areas affected by plagues and places of worship, while Saudi Arabia prohibited the entry of foreign pilgrims and its inhabitants into holy places in Mecca and Madinah.
This pandemic has caused the most significant disruption to the world’s sports calendar since World War II.
Most major sports events are cancelled or postponed, including the UEFA 2019-2020 Champions League, the 2019-2020 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019-2020 NBA season, and the 2019-2020 NHL season.
This plague disrupted the 2020 Summer Olympics plan, which was originally scheduled to begin at the end of July; the International Olympics Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be "rescheduled until after 2020, but will not be more than summer 2021."All over the world, casinos and other games closed and live poker tournaments postponed or cancelled.
This has caused many gamblers to move to online gambling, many online gambling sites to report significant new registrations, and the entertainment industry has also been affected, with various music groups delaying or canceling the concert tour.
A lot of big theaters like Broadway also delay all the shows.
Artists explore various ways of continuing to produce and share works through the Internet as an alternative for a traditional live show, such as direct online concert or making web-based "festival" for artists to perform, disseminate, and publish their works.
Many Internet memees have been spread online by people who switch to humor and distract in the midst of uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 outbreak, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia, and racism against the people of Tionghoa and East Asia, as well as against people from the affected regions of Europe, the United States, and other countries.
The incidents of fear, suspicion, and hostility observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports from February (when the majority of cases are still limited in Beijing) note racist sentiments expressed in various groups around the world that the Tionghoa people deserve to receive the virus or receive what they claim as an equal reward.
Some countries in Africa have also increased anti-Tiongkok sentiment.
Many Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination because of their region’s origin.
There's already been support for the Tionghoa people, both online and offline, and for the people in the affected areas.
Following the rise of the outbreak to the new hotspot countries, people from Italy, the first country in Europe who experienced a serious outbreak of COVID-19, could also be the target of suspicion and xenophobia. People in the countries include Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea at first signed a petition to prohibit the people from entering their country in an attempt to stop the disease.
In Japan, #ChineseDontComeToJapan tag is a train on Twitter.
The Tionghoa and other Asians in Britain and the United States reported an increase in the level of racial harassment and attack.
U.S. President Donald Trump was criticized for calling coronavirus "Tionkok virus", which critics considered racist and anti-Tionkok to be the term.

Students from eastern India, bordering with Tiongkok, and studying in the major cities of India are reported to have suffered from the disease of coronary artery disease.
President Bharatiya Janata State unit in West Bangladesh Dilip Ghosh states that the Tionkok has destroyed nature and "that is why God avenges them."
The statement was then threatened by the consulate of Tionkok in Kolkata, calling it "misleading", in Tionkok, xenophobia and racism against the non-Tionghoa people engaged in pandemics, with foreigners described as "foreign waste" and targeted for "destruction".
Many newspapers using payoffs have erased them for some or all of their coronaviruses.
Many scientific publishers make scientific papers related to epidemics available with open access.
Some scientists choose to quickly share the results on the print server, such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing for 2019 coronary breathing disease (COVID-19) and SARS-CoV-2 viruses includes methods that detect the presence of viruses and detect antibodies that are produced as a response to infection.
The presence of viruses in samples confirmed with RT-PCR, which detects coronary RNA.
This test is specific and designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 viruses only.
This test is used to confirm new or active infections.
Antibodies detection (serology) can be used for population diagnosis and monitoring.
Antibodies test indicates the number of people who have been infected, including those who are too mild to report or who have no symptoms.
The number of accurate disease mortality and the level of immunity in the population can be determined from this test.
Because of the limited testing, until March 2020, no country has any data on the prevalence of viruses in its population.
By March 23, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and there is a huge variation in the number of tests that have been carried out by countries.
This variability may also significantly affect the number of fatalities reported, which is likely to be too high in some countries.
Using the reaction of the polymerase chain back transcription real-time (rRT-PCR), this test can be done on breath samples obtained by various methods, including nasopharynx or sputum sample.
Generally, results are available in a few hours to two days.
RT-PCR tests performed on the neck strap can only be relied on in the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus could disappear in the throat while continuing to replicate in the lungs.
Alternatively, for an infected person tested in the second week, the sample material can be taken from the deep breathing channel by using the isip catheter or the material released through the cough (sputum) can be used.
One of the early PCR tests was developed in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020 using the back-time polymerase chain reaction transcription (rRT-PCR), and formed at least 250,000 test tools to be distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
British Raya also developed a test on January 23, 2020.The South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection device (PowerCheck Coronavirus) based on a clinical approach on January 28, 2020.
This device is looking for "E" genes that have all beta coronavirus, and RdRp genes that are specific to SARS-CoV-2. In Tiongkok, BGI Group is one of the first companies to accept the emergency use of the Tiongkok National Medical Product Administration for PCR-CoV-2 detection devices. In the United States, Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributes RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel Real-Time New Koronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) to the public health laboratory through the International Reagent Resource.
One of three genetic tests in the old version test result in unconvincing results due to reaction errors, and the number of CDC tests in Atlanta is limited; this results in an average of less than 100 samples per day successfully processed throughout February 2020.
Two components were considered unreliable until February 28, 2020, and then state labs and local labs were allowed to carry out testing.
This test was approved by the U.S. Drug and Food Supervisory Board based on the U.S. Emergency Use Authorisation. The U.S. Trade Laboratory began testing early March 2020.
On March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of a national RT-PCR-based COVID-19 test.
Similarly, Quest Diagnostics made COVID-19 testing available nationally on March 9, 2020.
There are no advertised quantity limits; the collection and processing of specimens must be done according to the CDC requirement.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Research Center of Virology and VECTOR Biotechnology.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Service for Surveillance in Health Care. On March 12, 2020, Mayo Clinic was reported to develop a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received an FDA approval for a test that could be performed within 3.5 hours of high volume so that one machine could perform about 4,128 tests within 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued authorization for emergency use (USA) to Abbott Laboratories for testing on the m2000 Abbott system; the FDA had previously issued the same authorization to Hollogic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received from the U.S.F.A. for a test that took about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test using non-PCR isothermal nuclear amplification technology.
Because it doesn’t require a series of changing temperature cycles, this method can produce positive results only in five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Currently there are about 18,000 machines in the U.S. and Abbott anticipates to increase production until they produce 50,000 tests per day. Tests using monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind new nucleopapsid (N-protein) proteins are being developed in Taiwan, with the hope that they can produce results within 15 to 20 minutes such as rapid influenza tests.
A library review published in March 2020 concluded that "photo thoraks have a small diagnostic value at the early stage, as CT [computed tomography] finds may already exist before the symptoms update."
Typical features in CT include bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacity with peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distributions.
Subpleura dominance, crazi paving, and consolidation are formed as a result of disease development.
In Wuhan, a study comparing PCR with CT at the present pandemic point shows that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, with many different imaging features that are consistent with pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "CT should not be used for screening or as the first line test in the diagnosis of COVID-19."On March 2020, the CDC recommended PCR for initial screening.
Part of the immune response to infection is the development of antibodies that include IgM and IgG.
This can be used to detect infection in individuals since about 7 days after the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity from disease, and in population monitoring. Checks can be done at the central laboratory (CLT) or with a point-of-care (PoCT) test.
The automatic system with high results in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform this check, but its availability will depend on the level of production for each system.
For CLT, a perifer blood specimen is generally used, although a series of specimens can be used to follow an immune response.
For POCT, a periphery blood specimen is generally used through skin punctures.
Unlike the PCR method, an extraction step is not required before the examination. On March 26, 2020, the FDA mentioned 29 agencies that provide notification to the agencies as needed and therefore can now distribute their antibodies.
On April 7, 2020, only one test approved by the FDA based on the authorization of emergency use. By the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics obtained European approval for their testing tools that could detect IgG and IgA antibodies against viruses in blood samples.
The ability to test up to a few hundred samples in a few hours, so much faster than conventional PCR testing against virus RNA.
Antibodies were usually detected 14 days after the infection, and at the beginning of April, the British found that none of the antibodies they purchased were good enough to be used.
Hong Kong prepared a scheme for expected patients to stay at home, "emergency department will give specimen tubes to patients," they spit into it, send it back, and obtain test results a few moments later. NHS British announced that NHS is pioneering the expected case testing scheme at home so that it eliminates the risk of patients taking people down if they come to the hospital or have to disinfect the ambulances if used. In the proposed COVID-19 case examination, a professional health officer will take samples using appropriate preventive action.
On 2 March, the National Association of Statuteary Health Insurance Physicians Germany said that Germany had capacity for about 12,000 tests per day in the road care system and 10,700 tests had been carried out in the previous week.
The cost is borne by health insurance if the test is requested by the doctor.
According to President Robert Koch Institute, Germany has an overall capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
On March 19, the graduation test was offered in several large cities.
On March 26, 2020, the number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown because only positive results were reported.
A first laboratory survey revealed that, in total, at least 483.295 samples have been tested until and including week 12/2020 and 33.491 samples (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers at the Temple Technion and Rambam developed and tested methods to test samples of 64 patients simultaneously, by merging samples and only testing further if the samples were found positive. In Wuhan, a 2,000-square meter emergency detection laboratory called "Huo-Yan" was opened on 5 February 2020 by BGI, which could process more than 10,000 samples a day.
With its construction supervised by BGI founder Wang Jian and taking five days, the modeling shows that the case in Hubei can be 47% higher and the cost of quarantine handling can double if this test capacity does not exist.
The Wuhan Laboratory was soon followed by the Huo-Yan Laboratory in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities throughout the city of Tiongkok.
On March 4, 2020, the total daily capacity is 50,000 tests per day. The open source multiplex design released by Origami Assays can test as many as 1,222 patient samples for COVID-19 using only 93 checks. This balanced design can be run in a small laboratory without the need for robotic fluid management.
By March, the shortage and quantity of reactors that are not sufficient had become a barrier to mass testing in the European Union, Britain, and the United States.
As a result, a number of researchers are trying to explore sample sampling protocols involving sampling at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genome for further testing. On March 31, the Arab Emirates was reported to do more coronavirus testing per capita population than in any country, and are ready to increase the scale of testing to reach most populations.
This is achieved through a combination of studies and the purchase of mass laboratory results from Group 42 and BGI (based on the "Huo-Yan" emergency detection laboratory in Tiongkok).
Built within 14 days, this laboratory is capable of carrying out tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory that has this scale outside of Tiongkok.
A number of test recipes aimed at various sections of the coronavirus genetic profile were developed in Tokyo, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopts German prescriptions for the production of testing tools that are sent to low-income countries without resources to develop themselves.
The German prescription was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the US Disease Control Center was not available until 28 January until it slowed the testing available in the United States. At the beginning of the epidemic, Tiongkok and the United States had problems with the lack of testing tools; both countries and Australia could not provide sufficient testing tools to meet the request and recommendations of health experts.
Instead, experts say that extensive testing in South Korea helps to reduce the spread of new coronary artery.
The capacity of testing, mostly in the private sector laboratory, was built in a few years by the South Korean government.
On March 16th, the World Health Organization called for an increase in the testing program as the best way to slow down the expansion of the COVID-19 pandemic.
By March 2020, Tiongkok reported problems with accuracy on their test tools.
In the United States, the test tool developed by the CDC has "failure"; the government then eliminates the obstacle of bureaucracy that prevents private testing. Spanish buys test tools from the company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but finds that the result is not accurate.
The company explains that incorrect results may result from failure to collect samples or use tests properly.
The Spanish Ministry says that they will pull equipment that produces bad results, and replace it with another test tool provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the test tool purchased by the Czech Republic from Tiongkok gives incorrect results.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested that this test tool be thrown into the Danube River. Kara's Atheş of the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the test tool purchased from Turkey from Tiongkok had "high error levels" and they did not "use it". English Raya bought 3.5 million test tools from Tiongkok, but early April 2020, they announced that this test tool could not be used.
The test, followed by quarantine of a positive and tracking person who contacts a positive SARS-CoV-2, results in a positive end.
Researchers working in the city of Vò Italia, the location of the first COVID-19 death in Italy, conducted two rounds of tests on the entire population of 3,400 people, with a distance of about 10 days.
About half of the positive people have no symptoms, and all cases found are quarantined.
By restricting travel to this community, new infections are completely eliminated.
With aggressive contact tracking, travel restrictions, testing, and quarantine, the 2020 kronavirus pandemic in Singapore developed much slower than other advanced countries even without extreme restrictions, such as the closure of restaurants and retail companies.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore suggested that people stay at home on March 28, but schools were reopened on time after the vacation on March 23.
Some other countries also deal with pandemics by tracking aggressive contacts, restricting entry, testing, and quarantine, but with quarantine less aggressive regions, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries that tested more, relative to the number of deaths, had a much lower fatality rate, perhaps because these countries were more able to detect people who had mild symptoms or without symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that have no testing capacity, and national labs with limited COVID-19 experience, send five COVID-19 positive samples first and ten negative samples first to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmation tests.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America, and 1 in Australia.
In the following chart, the column of the positive test results is influenced by the country's policy of testing.
The country that only tests people in hospitals will have % higher positive results than the country that tests all its inhabitants, whether they show symptoms or not, with the same factors.
Washing hands, which are also called handshakes, is the act of cleaning the hands of someone who aims to eliminate dirt, oil, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands with soap consistently on certain "critical times" throughout the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted through the fecal-oral route.
People may also be infected with respiratory disease, such as influenza or soreness, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
Five critical days of washing hands with soap are: before and after washing the asses of children or changing diapers, before eating, before and after preparing food, or eating meat, fish, or raw nails.
If water and soap do not exist, hands can be cleaned with ashes. World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before, when, and after preparing food.
Before and after taking care of the sick.
After changing diapers or cleaning children who just used toilets.
After cleaning the nose, cough, or sneezing.
After touching animals, animal food, or animal shit.
Medical hand cleaning refers to cleaning practices related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before providing medication or medical treatment can prevent or reduce the spread of disease.
The primary medical goal of washing hands is to clean hands from pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause danger or disease.
This is especially important for those who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the public.
Washing hands has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of influenza, coronary virus, and other infectious diseases; preventing contagious diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and reduce the number of infant mortality on childbirth at home.
The study conducted in 2013 showed that handwashing practical enhancements can slightly increase the high growth of the child.
In developing countries, the mortality rate of children due to respiratory and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple behavior changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple action can reduce the mortality rate due to the disease to almost 50%.
Handwashing interventions can reduce diarrhea by about a third; this intervention can be done by providing clean water in low - income areas.
48% of diarrhea reduction can be linked to handwashing with soap, washing hands with soap is the only most effective and cheap way to prevent diarrhea and infection of acute breathing (ISPA), as an unconscious behavior that is done at home, school, and society around the world.
Pneumonia, which is the main ISPA, is the cause of one child's death; this disease causes death about 1.8 million children per year.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia cause nearly 3.5 million children every year.
According to UNICEF, washing hands with soap before eating and using toilets into a cultured habit can save more lives than vaccines or any medical action, and reducing deaths from diarrhea to nearly half and death from acute respiratory infection to a quarter.
Washing hands is usually combined with other sanitary actions as part of the water program, sanitation, and cleaning (WASH).
Washing hands also protects itself from impetigo transmitted through direct physical contact.
The small side effect of washing hands is the washing of hands that is often done can cause skin damage due to skin drying.
A study carried out in 2012 in Denmark found that excessive handwashing can cause itching and sysy, which is known as extreme hands or dermatitis, especially among health workers.
Washing hands too often is seen as one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical moments throughout the day when washing hands with soap is important in order to reduce the spread of disease by faecal means: before and after using the toilet, after cleaning the ass of a child, before filling the child, before eating and before preparing food, or eating meat, fish, or raw nails.
Another important time to apply the right hand washing technique to prevent the spread of disease is before and after treating wounds; after sneezing, coughing, or blowing noses; after touching animal shit or treating animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, handwashing levels with soap are still low.
A study on handwashing in 54 countries in 2015 found that average 38.7% households practice handwashing with soap. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest level of 97 percent; the United States nearly in the middle of 77 percent; and Tiongkok at the lowest level of 23 percent. Now there are some methodologies for changing behavior to improve the habits of washing hands with soap at critical times. Washing hands group for students at determined times is one of the options in developing countries to standardize handwashing in children's behavior.
The Basic Health Care Program implemented by the Ministry of Education in the Philippines is an example of appropriate action to support the health and education of children.
The donation of worm drugs twice a year, plus by washing hands every day with soap and brushing teeth every day with fluoride, is the core of this national program.
This program has also been implemented in Indonesia.
Microorganism cleansing from the skin is reinforced by adding soap or detergent to the water.
The main work of soap and detergents is to reduce barriers to water supply and increase latent power.
Only water is a skin cleaner that is not efficient because of fat and protein, which is a component of organic dirt, is not easy to late in water.
However, the cleansing of fat and protein is supported by sufficient water flow.
Solid soap, because of its reusable qualities, may contain bacteria obtained from previous use.
A small number of studies investigating the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap conclude that transfer could not happen because of bacteria that are thinner with foam.
Even so, the CDC still states "the liquid soap that comes out of the container without touching the hand more liked."
The antibacterial soap strongly encourages the conscious society.
To date, there is no evidence that antiseptic use or disinfection is recommended better for organisms that hold antibiotics in nature.
However, antibacterial soap contains a common antibacterial agent such as ticlosan, which has a wide list of resistant organisms.
So, even if a strain that holds antibiotics is not targeted by antibacterial soap, this soap may not be as effective as it is.
In addition to the surface and skin protection, advanced formulations can contain acid (ascetic acid, ascorbated acid, lactate acid) as a pH adjuster, benzoate acid as an active antimicrobial, and further skin conditioner (buy tongue, vitamins, menthols, extracts of plants).A comprehensive analysis of the Faculty of Health of Oregon University University shows that ordinary soap is as effective as a consumer-level antibacterial soap that contains triculation to prevent disease and cleanse bacteria from hands.
Comfortable hot water to wash hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow faster at body temperature (37 °C).
Hot soap water is more effective than cold soap water in removing natural oil that holds off dirt and bacteria.
However, in contrast with the belief of many, scientific studies show that the use of warm water has no effect in reducing the number of microbes in the hands.
Hand-serving or antiseptic hand is an unwater-based cleaning agent.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, hand-cleaning agents were non-water-based alcoholics (also known as alcohol-based hand-brushers, antiseptic hand-brushes, or hand-remediation).
Most of these cleaning agents are isopropyl alcohol or ethanol that is formulated along with the governing material such as Carbomer (acrylate acid polymer) into gels or with moisture such as glycerin into fluid or foam to make it easy to use and to reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The addition of hydrogen peroxide incer increases antimicrobial activity further, hand care containing at least 60-95% alcohol is an effective germ killer.
Moorish alcohol service kills bacteria, resistant bacteria against many drugs (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis bacteria, a number of viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccination, influenza, and hepatitis), and fungi.
Alcohol service containing 70% alcohol killed 99.97% (log 3.5, similar to reduction 35 decibels) in hands 30 seconds after use and 99.99% to 99.999% (log 4 to 5) bacteria in hands 1 minute after use. Hand service is most effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand care is almost entirely not effective against norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, the most common cause of contagious gastroenteritis. Antseptics or alcohol-twisted in sufficient amount should be used to wet or cover two hands overall.
The front and back two hands and in the saddles and the end of all fingers are rubbed about 30 seconds into fluid, foam, or dry gel.
The fingertips should also be washed thoroughly by scrubbing them on two sides of the hand, and the U.S. Disease Control and Prevention Center should recommend handwashing instead of handwashing, especially when the hand looks dirty.
Increase the use of sanitation agents due to the ease of use and rapid homicide activity against microorganisms; however, the treatment agents should not be used as a correct handwash replacement, except soap and water are not available.
Use of alcohol-based hands can often cause dry skin, unless emolyenous and/or moisturizers are added to the formula.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emolyenous to the formula.
In clinical trials, the treatment of alcohol - based hands causing irritation and skin loss is much lower than soap and antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additive in the hand rubble rarely occurs.
Lower tendencies cause disruptive contact dermatitis to be this product's pull power compared to washing hands with water and soap.
Although effective, non-air agents don't clean hands off organic materials, but only disinfect them.
For this reason, hand cleaners are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens because they are still in hand.
The honesty of the free hand healing depends heavily on its material and formulation, and according to history, this product is significantly worse than alcohol and alcohol.
Recently, the formulation using benzalkonium chloride has been shown to have a continuous and cumulative antimicrobial activity after use, not like alcohol, which its safety has been reduced after repeated use, perhaps due to a progressive side effect reaction.
Many in low - income communities are unable to buy soap and use ashes or soil instead.
Abu or soil may be more effective than water, but less effective than soap.
One of the concerns is, if contaminated with microorganisms, soil or ash may increase the spread of disease instead of reducing it.
Like soap, ash is also an agent of disinfection because, if contact with water, ash will form an alkaline cortex.
WHO recommends ash and sand as an alternative soap when soap is not available.
The correct hand washing technique based on the recommendation of the US Disease Control Center for Disease Prevention includes the following steps:
Put your hands on the hot or cold water that flows.
Water flows are recommended because the silent bathtub may be contaminated, while the water temperature seems to be unaffected.
Wash your hands with a lot of soap, including the back of your hands, in your fingernails, and under your nails.
Soap raises germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap than when using water.
Gosh for at least 20 seconds.
Ripping creates a wrinkle, which helps remove germs from the skin, and scrubs longer to remove more germs.
Speak thoroughly under the water.
Washing in the bathtub can restore the contaminated hands.
Dry with a dry blanket or let it dry in the air.
Wet and wet hands are easier to recontaminate, the area that is often crossed is thumbs, wrists, the area between the fingers, and under the nails.
The artificial nails and the faded nails can store microorganisms.
It is often recommended to keep hands from drying; dry skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of infection transmission.
A number of low-cost options can be made to facilitate washing of hands when tap water and/or soap are not available, for example, flowing water from a gyre or bottle that is hung and frozen and/or using ashes, if necessary, in developing countries. In situations where limited water supplies (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there is a water-emitting solution, such as "type-tops", and other low-income options.
Because tippy is a simple technology that uses water bottles that are attached to ropes, ankles that are operated by feet to pour a little water into the hands, and soap.
Effective hand-bending is an important part of the hand-cleaning process, but there is a debate about the most effective form of hand-drying in the public toilet.
The more research shows that paper sheets are much cleaner than electric hand dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study by Westminster University, London, and arranged by the European paper industry Tissue Symposium, to compare the cleaning levels of paper sheets, warm air dryers, and more moderate jet air dryers.
After washing and drying hands with hot air dryers, the total number of bacteria found increased by an average of 194% in the finger books and 254% in the palm of the hand.
Reflecting with jet air dryers causes a total increase in the average number of bacteria 42% in the fingerbooks and 15% in the palm of hands.
After washing and drying hands with paper sheets, the total number of bacteria decreases by 76% in the fingers and 77% in the palm of the hand.
Jet air dryers, which blow air from the unit at a speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), are capable of blowing microorganisms from hands and units and potentially polluting the use of other toilets and toilet environments up to 2 m.
The use of warm air dryers spreads microorganisms up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
Paper sheets do not show significant microorganism spread. In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Product und Umwelt, various methods of hand drying were evaluated.
After drying hands, changes in the following bacteria are observed:
There are many hand dryers, and hand dryers have been compared with drying using paper sheets.
Washing hands using hand weavers is an alternative during travel without soap and water.
Alcohol-based hand service should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical handwashing was required far after physicist Ignaz Semmelweis found its effectiveness (in 1846) to prevent disease in the hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital employees to wash their hands if they forget.
One study found that the level of infection decreased with the use of that device.
Medical handwashing is done for at least 15 seconds, using soap and water in a large amount or gel to fertilize and rub every part of the hand.
Hands have to rub each other with fingers sticking together.
If there's dirt under the nails, the brushes can be used to remove it.
Since germs can survive in the water that is in hand, hands need to be thoroughly bleached and dried with clean sheets.
After dryness, paper sheets are used to turn off the water floor (and open the exit door if necessary).
This action avoids hand-contamination from the surface.
The purpose of washing hands in the health care settings is to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms ("comments") and avoid their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the lack of handwashing is still at an unacceptable level in most medical environments, with a large number of doctors and nurses continually forgetting to wash their hands before touching the patient so as to transmit microorganisms.
One study shows that washing the right hand and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of blood flow infection related to catheters up to 66 percent.
The concept of hand-cleaning WHO can also be seen on its website for public comment.
The relevant review by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices can measure and validate hand hygiene if a demonstration of compliance with the rules is required.
World Health Organization has "Five Time" to wash hands:
after exposed to the blood/body fluid
before the aseptic task, and
After the patient's treatment, an antiseptic chemical is added to soap or antimicrobial soap.
The function of killing may be desired before surgery or in situations where an antibiotic-resistant organism is very common; to 'clean' the hand before surgery, it is necessary to turn the hand on and off without touching, to wash chlorhexidin or iodium, to dry the hand after washing, and to wash the sterile brush and other sterile instruments to clean under the nail.
All jewelry should be released.
This procedure means washing hands and arms down to the elbow, usually 2–6 minutes.
Long barking time (10 minutes) is not necessary.
When bleaching, water in the lower arm must be prevented from flowing back into the hand.
Once the hands have been washed, the hands are dried with sterile cloth and surgical clothing is worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands or use handwash before and after treating the sick.
For the control of staphylococcus infections in the hospital, it was found that the greatest benefit of cleaning hands comes from the first 20% washing, and that the additional benefit obtained is very little when the hand cleaning frequency is increased above 35%.
Washing with ordinary soap results in more than three times the spread of infection to food than washing with antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based handwashing to reduce the influenza A H1N1 virus and spore Clostridium difficult from hand. Intervention to improve hand cleaning in healthcare settings can involve education for staff about washing hands, increasing the availability of alcohol-based handwashing, and written reminders and lipstick to staff.
More research is needed to find out the most effective interventions in various health - care settings.
In developing countries, washing hands with soap is recognized as a basic cost-effective way to achieve good health and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supplies, soap, or handwashing facilities in homes, schools, and workplaces makes it a challenge to achieve universal handwashing behavior.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, handwashing paper near private toilets or public toilets rarely exists, even though there is a choice to make a cheap handwash.
In any case, low levels of handwashing may also occur because of habits that have been planted and not because of lack of soap or water.
Dormitory and encouragement washing hands with soap can affect policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of washing hands, and produce changes in long - term population behavior.
To run effectively, monitoring and evaluation is required.
Systematic review of 70 studies found that an effective community-based approach to improving handwashing in LMIC, while a less effective social marketing campaign. One example of handwashing at school is the "Three Star Approach" by UNICEF that encourages schools to take simple and cheap steps to ensure students wash their hands with soap, among other requirements of cleanliness.
When minimum standards are achieved, schools can move from one star to finally three stars.
Building a washing machine can be part of the handwashing campaign to reduce the disease and death of children.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness-raising campaign that seeks to achieve the goal of changing behaviour. As a result of the 2019-2020 crown virus pandemic, UNICEF encourages handwashing emojis.
Some studies investigate the effectiveness of the cost of washing hands altogether in developing countries in relation to the avoidance of disability-adjusted Life Year (DALY) or the size of the year lost as a result of the illness.
One review shows that encouraging handwashing with soap is significantly more expensive than taking over other water and sanitation.
It is important to wash hands for human health, especially for vulnerable people, such as the newly born mother or wounded soldiers in the hospital, first known in the middle of the 19th century by two hand cleaners: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis working in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, "the protector of modern care" in England.
At that time, many people still believe that infection is caused by the rotten smell called miasma or bad air.
In the 1980s, the epidemics transmitted through food and infections related to health care made the United States Disease Control and Prevention Center more active to encourage hand cleaning as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
Pig flu outbreaks in 2009 and COVID-19 pandemics in 2020 increased awareness in many countries of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect themselves from the infectious disease.
For example, the poster "technological washing the right hand" hung next to the wash sink in the public toilet and in the office building and airport in Germany.
The expression "washing hands off" means declaring a person's refusal to be responsible for something or to be involved in something.
That expression comes from a Bible chapter in Matthew’s book when Pontius Pilate washed his hands on the decision to cross Jesus Christ, but it has become a widely used expression in the British community.
In Shakespeare's work, Macbeth, Lady Macbeth began to wash her hands continually to clean up the imaginary stain; an act that showed her guilt for the crime she did and for convincing her husband to do so.
It has also been known that, after remembering or meditating on unethical actions, people tend to wash their hands more often and tend to appreciate handwashing equipment more.
Moreover, those who are left to wash their hands after such meditation have a smaller level of involvement in "cleaning" compensation, such as volunteering.
Religion commands the washing of hands for cleansing and symbolic purposes. The washing of hands, which uses water, but without soap to wash hands, is a part of the ritual to wash hands in many religions, including the faith of Bahá'í, Hindu, Tevilah and Netilat Yadayim in Jews, Lavabo in Christians, and Wudhu in Islam, and the religion also commands the washing of hands for cleansing, especially after certain actions.
Hindu, Jewish, and Islamic religions require handwashing after using the toilet.
In addition, Hindus, Buddhas, Sikhs, Jews, and Islam are obliged to wash their hands before and after eating.
Hazard control at work for COVID-19
Controlling the workplace for COVID-19 is the safety and health methodology for the prevention of 2019 coronary disease (COVID-19).
Proper risk control at the workplace depends on the location of work and work, which is based on the risk assessment of the sources of exposure, the level of disease in society, and the risk factor of each worker that may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk jobs have minimal contact with the public and other partners; for this work, basic infection prevention measures are encouraged, including handwashing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, breathing ethics, and routine cleaning and disinfection of the workplace.
Work risk exposures include work requiring close contact or often with unknown or suspected people suffering from COVID-19, but may be infected by transmission in the current society or international travel.
This group includes workers who have contact with public society such as in schools, working environments with high population density, and high-volume retail settings.
Risk control for this group, apart from the basic infection prevention steps, includes ventilation using high efficiency air filter, protection against sneezing, and providing self-protection when meeting with COVID-19 sufferers.
OSHA considers the health and morgue of the known or suspected COVID-19 to be at high risk, which increases to the risk of high exposure if workers perform aerosol production procedure on, or take or handle specimens from, the known or suspected COVID-19.
The appropriate hazard control for this worker includes technical control, such as negative pressure ventilating room, and self - protective equipment that fits the task.
The COVID-19 outbreak can have some impact on the workplace.
Employees may not come to work because of illness, need to take care of others, or fear of exposure.
Trade patterns can change, either in terms of the type requested or how to obtain these goods (like shopping outside the busy hour, through delivery, or raising).
Finally, shipments of goods from the geographical region that are highly affected by COVID-19 could be disturbed.
The plan considers the risk associated with various workplaces and jobs, including the sources of peerage, the risk factors arising from home and society settings, and the risk factors of each worker, such as age or chronic medical conditions.
The plan also outlines the necessary controls to address the risk and emergency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the disease.
The perception and plans of the disease outbreak may be submitted to national or subnational recommendations.
The aim of the outbreak included reducing transmission among staff, protecting those at greater risk for the complications of bad health, maintaining business operations, and minimizing the negative effects on other entities in the supply chain.
The degree of disease severity in the community where business is affecting the actions taken.
Hierarchy of hazard control is a working framework that is widely used in safety and health at work to group risk control based on its effectiveness.
When the COVID-19 danger cannot be eliminated, the most effective control is technical control, followed by administrative control, and the last self-protective device.
Technical control includes insulating employees from work-related dangers without depending on the behaviour of workers and can be the most expensive solution to be applied.
Administrative oversight is a change in policy or procedure that requires action by the worker or the giver.
Self-protection tools (PADs) are considered less effective than technical and administrative control, but can help prevent some bias.
All types of APDs should be selected based on worker hazard, properly installed as they occur (e.g., respirators), consistently and correctly worn, checked, cared for, and replaced on a regular basis, if necessary, and released, cleaned, and stored correctly or discarded to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low - income jobs have minimal contact with the public and other employees.
Steps to prevent basic infections recommended for all workplaces include washing hands thoroughly, encouraging workers to stay at home if illness, breathing ethics include covering cough and sneezing, preparing networks and garbage vessels, preparing jobs from a distance or working shifts with time of arrival/return, if necessary, telling workers not to use other people's tools and equipment, and routinely cleaning and disinfecting the working environment.
A quick identification and isolation of potential communicators is an important step in protecting workers, customers, visitors, and others at work.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with acute respiratory disease should stay at home until they are free from fever, fever signs, and other symptoms for at least 24 hours without using fever reduction drugs or other symptoms-modifying drugs, and that the sick leave policy be flexible so that employees can stay at home to care for sick family members, and that employees know this policy.
According to OSHA, work at risk of exposure is included in work requiring close contact or often within six feet (1.8 meters) with unknown or suspected people suffering from COVID-19, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 because of a broadcast in society around the business location, or because someone has just made an international trip to the location with a large COVID-19 broadcast.
This group includes workers who have contact with public society such as school, work environment with high population density, and high-volume rituals. Technical control for this group and high risk groups include installing high efficiency air filters, increasing ventilation levels, installing physical impediments such as sneezing plastics, and installing non-essential drives-thru windows or set up for customer service. Administrative control for this group and high risk groups include pushing sick workers to stay at home, changing face-to-face meetings with virtual communication, making work shifts with time to arrive/to-minute meetings, stopping unnecessary journeys to the location of COVID-19, developing emergency communications plans with this group include forums to respond to workers' concerns, equip workers with education and up-to-date training on the risk factors COVID-19 and changing their protective behaviors, training workers who need to use their clothes and tools to respond to workers, equip workers with education and training on the basis of protective measures, training in terms of personal safety and safety, as well as well as to provide support the use of the public authorities and the environment.
Workers in this risk group rarely need a respirator.
If someone falls ill on a plane, proper control to protect workers and other passengers includes separating the sick from others by six feet, pointing out one cabin crew to take care of the sick, and offering face masks to the sick or asking him to close his mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing.
The cabin crew should wear medical gloves once and for all when treating sick passengers or touching the body fluid or surface that could be contaminated and perhaps other protective tools if the sick passenger suffers from fever, continuous cough, or difficulty breathing.
The gloves and other items should be disposed of in life-threatening bags, and the contaminated surface should be cleaned and disinfected after them, and for commercial voyages, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, the danger control should include delaying travel if it is sick, isolating itself, and inform the medical center on top of the ship immediately if someone has a fever or other symptoms while on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up is done in the cabins of people who are isolated, except in the public, for schools and childcare facilities, the CDC recommends a short-term closure to clean or disinfect if the infected person has ever been in the school building.
If there is a minimal to-date transmission in society, social exclusion strategies can be implemented, including: canceling field visits, meetings, and other large groups, such as physical education, classrooms, or eating in the cafeteria, increasing the distance between table, arrival time and a gradual return, restricting non-essential visitors, and using separate health offices for children with flu-like symptoms.
If there is a high transmission in local society, in addition to social exclusion strategies, it may be considered to extend the closure of schools. For law enforcement officers who perform daily routine activities, the risk of health directly considered to be low by the CDC.
Law enforcement officers who have to make contact with confirmed or expected COVID-19 are recommended to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including using appropriate self-protective devices.
If close contact occurs during arrest, workers must clean and disinfect belts and task equipment before re-use using sprays or household cleaners and follow standard operating procedures to control and remove old APDs and to control and wash dirty clothes.
OSHA believes that certain health and morgues are at high or very high risk categories.
Work at high risk involves providing health care, support, laboratory, and medical transportation services that are exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
This job becomes a very high risk of exposure if workers do aerosol procedures on, or take or handle specimens from, known or suspected COVID-19.
Aerosol processes include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronkoscopes, some dental procedures and dental examinations, or invasive specimens.
The work of the morgue risks high exposures include workers who are involved in preparing the body of the known or suspected COVID-19 case at the time of death; this work becomes extremely high exposure risk if the worker performs an autopsy. Additional technical control for this risk group includes isolation space for known or suspected COVID-19 patients, including when aerosols are produced.
Special negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some health care settings and morgues.
Species must be handled by biological safety level three.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients who come be separated into different waiting rooms based on whether they are expected to have a COVID-19 case.
In the United States, the N95 filter face-coverer approved by NIOSH or better should be used in the context of written and comprehensive breathing protection programs that include appropriate testing, training, and medical examinations.
Another type of respirator can provide greater protection and improve the comfort of workers. WHO does not recommend covered clothing entirely or coverall because COVID-19 is respiratory disease and is not transmitted through body fluid.
WHO only recommends a surgical mask for the screening officer at the entry point.
For those who take breath specimens, take care of, or transport COVID-19 patients without aerosol engineer procedure, WHO recommends surgical masks, protective glasses, or facial shields, robes, and gloves.
If aerosol delivery procedure is done, a surgical mask is replaced with a N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Considering that ODA supplies are not enough worldwide, WHO recommends minimizing the needs of ODA through long-distance medical services, physical limitations such as vision window, with only those involved in direct care can enter the room containing COVID-19 patients, use only ODA necessary for certain tasks, continue to use the same breather without releasing it while caring for many patients with the same diagnosis, monitor and coordinate the ODA supply chain, and do not push the use of masks for people without symptoms.

SUBJEK BARIS: [Covid-19] lightens the load and prepares the future
BRANCH/WAIT OF POWERING: March 14, 2020, 00:24 UTC
CLASSIFICATION: CC0: No rights protected
We found ourselves in a unique situation this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is something that makes it clear that global human relations and the responsibility we have for each other.
We have never experienced the challenge, but we know that our best response depends on the form of empathy, cooperation, and global community building, which is the heart of this organization.
The friendship and concern we've witnessed among all the coworkers through email, calls, and talks is an extraordinary validation of extraordinary human beings, which we're lucky enough, to work with them.
My gratitude and pride are infinitely limitless. You can call yourself a workmate.
Last week, someone shared with me their appreciation for our work.
They remind me of how important it is for the world today to be able to access Wikipedia and how powerful this is a symbol for this important resource to remain available to everyone.
Your work allows this to happen, whether you make sure this site stays running, helps pay our partners, or helps keep our community safe.
The world needs information that Wikipedia provides, especially now.
This is a moment when not only the work we do, but the way we do it will make a significant impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make some important adjustments to the way we work together, which will begin next week.
Adjustments to our work and schedule
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the team-c met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for a few days and months to come.
In that conversation, we considered what we thought was the right response to the challenges we faced and the best way to maintain the survival of the organization these days.
We really want to remove the pressure and support our mission for a long time.
If you need to cut down on work schedules, it's okay.
For all staff, contractors, and contract workers:
our daily work hope is about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week, until further notice.
We don't set a day off, if you can work more at normal hours, this mission needs you.
However, the world cannot be predicted right now, and whether you need to care for loved ones, shop for basic needs, or go to a doctor, your well - being is our priority.
We're not monitoring your working time.
If you're sick, don't work.
It should not have been said, but we said it.
Sick leave or PTO isn't necessary, just let your manager know and help your team review the calendar and schedule to ensure that the main areas of work can be completed.
(If you are diagnosed positively with COVID-19, please let Bryan know in T&C Ops that T&C can help with support and make sure your situation gets the right attention from management).
The colleagues whose hour-based wages will be paid full.
We have said it, and say it again, to respect our commitment to our fellow contractors and staff based on hours.
Everyone will be paid on the basis of their normal work time during their normal state of affairs.
It includes if you're sick and can't work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a means to channel stress against the world around us.
The work we do can be very satisfying, especially in times like this.
Again, the main thing is to take care of yourself.
Our request is that you communicate with your manager so we know what to anticipate and can take appropriate action.
Certain jobs are considered essential.
There's some work to keep going.
SRE, SDM operations, Trust & Security, and the Dane Building Team, among others, do important work that may require additional support.
We're going to start the process with all the departments to assess the current purpose and distract our focus to support the essentials of our mission.
There's a lot to do for all of us, we'll just focus on the most essential project.
Slowing down now will be nothing for the future.
We don't plan to "work overtime after the loss" after this pandemic passes.
You won't be expected to work overtime to fill an unrealistic amount of time at this time.
We realized that the situation changed and would try to set new targets and timelines if necessary.
What about the APP?
To adjust to new realities and everyday working hours, we meant to adjust the timeline for the implementation of the 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
We mean to propose an extension of the 2019-2020 plan that allows more time to make budgets so that employees can prioritize important work, self-care, and care of loved ones as they accommodate their needs or want to work with less schedule for the next few weeks.
The extension of this time line greatly reduces the workload and pressures of current planning throughout the organization.
We're going to deliver our proposal to the Council next week and update the delegation and the team on the next step as soon as we get confirmation.
Thank you the APP team for your leadership in this.
Status, layout, and office cleaning
Last week, we were told that one of our partners based on SF may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, out of great concern, we hired an anti-virus cleaner crew to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They use hospital-grade antivirus fluids to disinfect every surface, lobby, and all elevator that access our floor.
The building implements its own security screening protocol by using products that support the safety of the tenant.
We're glad that the office will be ready for use when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located in WeWork, which has distributed the COVID-19 protocol to us and all staff members based in DC.
Starting last week, our DC office has moved to a long-distance, long-distance service, along with a guide shared with San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues based on NYC know, we're also discussing renting locations in Brooklyn.
This discussion is still ongoing, but it may be delayed.
Some of our associates work from a distance for the first time.
Our long-working partner realizes that it may need to be adjusted and they want to advise you:
Limit the duration of the meeting for at least an hour or two.
If a longer session is needed, consider how it might take several days.
Define a clearly defined relationship, make an agenda, and send previous publications.
Make video as default, with such tools as Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and direct connection.
Lead signs to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor conversations for questions and record the speaker's list, and someone to help make a meeting record (or do collaborative records).
Send email to technical support if you need a comfortable headset.
Use your welfare compensation to buy small food.
Join #remote channels in Slack to talk to colleagues about shared work
The SDM Operation team is looking for a webinar-based ergonomics guide to support the expansion of the work distributed throughout the Foundation.
Last week we asked all the recipients to take the community to cancel the public program funded by Wikimedia, like Edit-a-thon, until WHO declared the pandemic is over.
We told them that we understood our request for cancellation and other restrictions could make it impossible for them to complete the unacceptable activity and that no one would be given the pintal because they had to delay or modify the target.
Next week we will continue with additional guidance on Wikimania and regional community conferences and other topics.
In general, the sentiments of the entire global community seem to be sadness over this disorder, but at the same time relieved of the clarity and ability to focus on its own community, both Wikimedia and others.
In the future, CRT is trying to prepare a page in Meta-Wiki to provide community space to monitor the impact and follow our communication with them.
Stay connected during the COVID-19 situation
We'll send an invitation to your calendar for next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special staff meeting.
We will use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions, and take time to connect.
We're both in this situation and we want to help as much as we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to obtain information from this email and all the essential information related to COVID-19 at the Wiki Office.
CRT will continue to update this page and make sure all information is in one place.
We also try to keep regular communication with staff living in countries that are currently significantly affected.
If you have questions about travel, events, the main course of work, or the difficulty of the conversation, or other things that may need help, do not hesitate to inform and work with CRT.
We're here to help provide support and become the linker to the needs.
If you have a secret or sensitive problem, please email Bryan Judah, Director of Global Operations International SDM.
None of this change is seen as a burden on our work and our obligation.
On the contrary, this change is a recognition that, at present, our work and duties may need to be adapted in ways we have never done before.
These changes are steps that we believe are important to support each other in this situation so that we can continue to work, provide the support that we need, and provide the service world that they expect.
The work we planned before will be there waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it is time to support one another and create room for important work that will come in a few weeks and perhaps a few months to come.
We need you all to make it happen, for that, we want you to take care of yourself and your family so you can work best when needed.
Finally, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and members of the other Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
b'Enzym angiotensin 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that binds to the outer surface of the cell (cell membrane) in the lungs, arteries, hearts, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 has an activity that is opposed to angiotensin (ACE), by reducing the number of angiotensin-II and increasing Angiotensin (1-7), making it a promising target for treating cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also acts as a dot into the cell for some coronary artery.
ACE2 human version is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin 2 converting enzyme is metaloenzym containing a joint located on the surface of the endothel cell and other cells.
ACE2 protein has domain M2 peptide terminal-N and domain transporter renal amino acid colectrin terminal-C.
ACE2 is a single type I membrane membrane, with the active domain enzymatically displayed on the surface of the cell in the lungs and other networks.
The ACE2 extraneous domain is separated from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme, known as sheddase, and the resulting latent protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted into the urine.
ACE2 is found in most organs: ACE2 binds to cell membranes especially type II pulmonary alveolar cells, small intestinal enterositis, arterial and vena endothel cells, and pulmonary muscle cells in most organs.
MRNA ACE2 expression was also found in cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brain stem.
The main function of ACE2 is to measure the ACE.
ACE divides angiotensin I hormone into angiotensin II vasoconstriction.
Finally, ACE2 cut amino phenylalanine terminal karboxil acid from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysis it into angiotensin (1-7) vasodilator (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also divide a number of other peptides including [des-Arg9] -bradikin, apneumin, neurotensin, dinorphin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also arranges traffic through membrane transporter Amino neutral acid SLC6A19 and involved in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 functions as the main entry point into the cell for some coronavirus, which includes HCOV-NL63; SARS-CoV (virus causing SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (virus causing COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of S1 proteins on the spike or spike of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 with the enzyme domain ACE2 on the surface of the cells leads to endocytosis and translocation of viruses and enzymes into the endosomes within the cell.
The process of entering this virus also requires the primary protein S by the serum protease inang TMPRSS2, which its obstruction is currently being investigated as a potential therapy. This fact makes people hypothetical that the decrease in ACE2 levels in cells may help fight infection.
However, many professional societies and regulatory bodies recommend continuing ACE and ARB standard inhibitory therapy.
A systematic review and meta-analysis, published on July 11, 2012, found that "the ACE inhibitor use caused a decrease of 34% in the risk of pneumonia compared to control."
Further, "use of ACE inhibitors also lowers the risk of pneumonia in patients with higher risk for pneumonia, especially stroke patients and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors is also associated with reduced mortality related to pneumonia, although the results are less powerful than the risk of overall pneumonia."
ACE2 recombinant humans (rhACE2) are expected to be a new therapy for acute lung injury, and it seems to increase the hemodynamics of the lungs and oxygen saturation on the pig with acute breathing syndrome induced by lipolisaccharide.
RhACE2 parttime on humans about 10 hours with a 30 minute workday other than its duration (duration) 24 hours long.
Some findings indicate that rhACE2 may be a promising medicine for patients with intolerance to classical renin-angiotensin inhibitor (RAS inhibitor) or angiotensin II disease in blood circulation increased. Infus rhACE2 has been evaluated in clinical trials for acute respiratory failure syndrome.
b'Application COVID-19 is a mobile software application designed to help track contacts to resume the 2019-2020 coronary pandemic, which is a process of identifying people ("contact") who may have made contact with infected people.
Many applications have been developed or proposed, with official government support in some regions and jurisdictions.
Some workframes for building contact tracking applications have been developed.
The privacy issue is questioned, especially with regard to the system that is based on tracking the geographic location of the application user.
Alternatives that do not enter too much privacy include the use of Bluetooth signals to record the user's proximity to other phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple together announced that they would integrate functionality to support those Bluetooth-based applications directly into the Android and iOS operating systems.
In Tyeongkok, the government of Tionkok, together with Alipay, has released applications that allow citizens to check if they have been in contact with COVID-19 sufferers.
This application is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, it is used as TraceTogether.
This application was developed by the local IT community, released as an open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia launched "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth-based application to track down the bias against potentially infected people and provide rapid response to the health care authority.
This application was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
Until 14 April 2020, the app is still awaiting Google Play Store and Apple App Store approval.
On 12 April, the government stated that the contact tracking application is in the development stage and will be available for distribution within a few weeks. Similar applications are scheduled in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on TraceTogether Singapore applications and BlueTrace protocols. Russia intends to introduce geofencing applications for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 living in Moscow; this application is designed to ensure they do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security technology at Cambridge University, mentions a number of practical problems that may occur in the application-based system, which include false positives and the likelihood of a lack of effectiveness if data taken from limited applications are taken only in a small number of populations.
To address concerns about the spread of misleading or dangerous "coronavirus" applications, Apple sets limits on the type of organization that can add the coronavirus-related application to the App Store, which is restricted only to "resmi" organizations or which have a good reputation.
Google and Amazon apply similar limitations.
Privatists express their concern about the involvement of mass surveillance using the coronavirus app, especially about whether the monitoring infrastructure that is designed to deal with the coronary pandemic will be stopped after the threat has passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations make statements calling for limitations on such surveillance.
This organization states eight conditions on government projects:
surveillance must be "according to law, necessity, and proportionality";
The need for surveillance and surveillance must have a sunset clause;
data use should be restricted for COVID-19 purposes;
data security and anonymity must be protected and proven to be protected on the basis of evidence;
digital surveillance must avoid the worsening of discrimination and marginalization;
each data division with the third party must be defined in the laws;
there must be protection against abuse and the right of citizens to respond to abuse;
participation means all "my relevant interests" required, which includes community health experts and marginalized groups. Chaos Computer Club (CCC) Germany and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter of the Grenzen) (RSF) also issued a checklist.
The proposed Google/Apple plan is intended to address ongoing monitoring problems by removing tracking mechanism from the device operating system after it is no longer required.
Some countries use network-based tracking, rather than applications, to eliminate the need for downloading applications and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network - based tracking was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have significant privacy potential.
However, not all systems with central servers need to access personal location data; a number of systems that protect privacy have been created and use central servers only for communication (see section below).
In South Korea, an application-based system is used to track contacts.
Instead of using special applications, the system collects tracking information from various sources, includes cell phone tracking data and card transaction data, and combines this information to generate notification through text messages to people with infected potential.
In addition to using this information to warn potential contacts, the government also makes the location information available to the public, which is permitted by extensive changes in the privacy laws after the Mers has been shot in the country.
This information is available for the public through a number of applications and websites. Countries such as Germany consider using both the focused system and the privacy protection system.
Until 6 April 2020, the details have not been released.
The privacy-protected contact tracking is a concept that has been mapped, with a large number of research literature starting at least in 2013.On April 7, 2020, more than one dozen expert groups were working on privacy friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), to record the user's proximity to other phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort that contains a focus and decentralized approach, rather than a single protocol. The decentralized protocol includes the Decentralized Privacy Protection (DP-PPT/DP-3T), the Temporary Contact Number (TCN, formerly called the Number of Events Contact, CEN), the Privacy Sensitive Protocol and Mechanism for Mobile Contact Tracking (PACT), and others.
In this protocol, personal data that can be identified never leaves the device, and all matching occurs on the device.
The Privacy Group at the MIT Media Lab developed SafePaths, a platform for using privacy protection techniques when collecting and using the location or cross-section data line to track the COVID-19 spread.
This is based on a study of the white sheet "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" released on March 2020.Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, a company that developed privacy technology and was originally set up at MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technology to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officers without sacrificing the privacy of the data.
On April 5, 2020, the Global TCN Coalition was set up by groups with basically the same approach and is a protocol that is highly resilient, with the aim of reducing fragmentation and enabling global interoperability for tracking and warning applications, which is the main aspect of achieving broad acceptance.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that they had made the BlueTrace protocol used by its official government applications an open source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the company that controls Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced the initiative to trace contacts, which they claim will protect privacy, based on the combination of low-energy Bluetooth technology and privacy-protected cryptography.
They also publish the core technology specifications used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, this system is meant to be launched in three stages:
launch tools to allow governments to make official coronavirus tracking applications that protect privacy
integration of this function directly into iOS and Android Google and Apple are planning to address data collection and monitoring issues and continue to initially distribute the system through an operating system update, then delete it in the same way after the threat passes.
b'Reposition drug (also called a new purpose gift, a new profile, or a new task in medicine or therapy) is a drug that has been approved for the purpose of new treatment, that is, for disease or medical conditions that are different from the initial goal of drug development.
This path is the current scientific research path to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatment.
Another direction of research includes the development of COVID-19 vaccines and convalsen plasma transfusions. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 proteins that can be a drug target, each protein has several binding sites.
Analysis of ligand binding sites can be the basis for effective anti-virus development of COVID-19 proteins.
Some of the most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are papain-like proteases, RNA polymerase depends on RNA, helicase, protein S, and ADP ribophosphatase.
Hussein A A, et al investigated some of the potential candidates who were then optimized and analyzed with the same substance as the approved drugs and had the highest ampirity to accelerate the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 potent drugs in his practical study to be recommended in clinical study design.
Klorokulin is an antimalarial drug that is also used against some autoimmune disease.

Governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, announced that chlorokin and hydrochlorokulin testing in New York would begin on March 24th. On March 28th, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxylonucleic sulphate and chlorocarbon phosphate based on the U.S. Emergency Use Authorisation.
This treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and authorized by the US only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in patients treated inap, but cannot accept treatment in clinical trials.
The CDC says that "use, dose, or duration of hydroxycholokuin for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2" infection has not been established.
The doctor said they used that medicine when there was no choice.
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is doing a small study of the use of chlorokuin combined with seng, vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin D.
Major studies are being conducted at Duke University and University of Oxford.
NYU Langone Medical School is testing safety tests and honesty in the use of hydroxyclorokulin preventives.
The Tiongkok clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claim that favipiravir proved to be "clearly effective".
Thirty-five patients in Shenzhen were tested negative in median 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive the drug.
In a study conducted in Wuhan in 240 patients with pneumonia, half of the patients were given favipiravir and half received umifenovir.
The Italian Pharmacy Agency reminds the public that there is evidence to support the drug in a relatively small and early way.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the medicine from Japan for supplies and use by the military to send drugs to the university hospital, where it would be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has made an offer to Trump's government about the purchase of the drug, which may be less effective in the case of a serious virus that has multiplied.
This medicine may not be safe if used by pregnant mothers or people who try to conceive.
A study on lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir antivirus, concluded that "there is no observed benefit".
This drug is designed to hinder HIV replication by binding protease.
A research team at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drug to find a compound that will bind to SARS-CoV-2 protease.There is a critique in scientific society about resource guidance to position a drug that is developed specifically for HIV/AIDS.
WHO incorporates lopinavir/ritonavir into the international Solidarity test.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infection, and then Gilead Sciences discovered that Remdesivir had antivirus activity in vitro against some phylo-, pneumo-, paramikso-, and coronavirus.
One problem with antivirus treatment is resistance through mutations that can cause more serious disease and transmission.
Some early trials show that redesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance, and some clinical trials are ongoing, including two clinical trials carried out by the Cleveland University Hospital, one for the sick and one for the sick.
There are three clinical trials currently under way for intravenous vitamin C for those treated with inap and severe COVID-19, two controlled plastics (Tiongkok, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
New York states started testing for azithromycin antibiotics on March 24, 2020.
Japanese National Center for Health and Global Medicine (NCGM) is planning a clinical trial for Alvesco (cyclesonide) Teijin, corticoid inhalation for asthma, for treatment of new presymtomatic coronary infection patients.
For an enzyme form of angiotensin 2 angiotensin, a phase II trial is ongoing with 200 patients will be recruited from a severe case treated in Denmark, Germany, and Austria to find out the effectiveness of treatment.
Research from the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada is currently investigating the colloquial role in reducing inflammation and lung complications in patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms.
The study, called COLCORONA, recruited 6,000 adults over 40 years of age and older who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and had mild symptoms that did not require inhalation.
Women who are pregnant or breast - feeding or do not use effective contraception methods do not qualify.
Some anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low - molecular heparin is widely used to treat patients so that it encourages the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multicenter study of 300 patients investigating the use of enocsaparin natrium at prophylaxis and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy on April 14.
Because SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, a lot of scientific attention is focused on giving new treatment to approved and developed antivirus drugs for previous outbreaks, such as MERS, SARS, and West Nile viruses.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin recommended for COVID-19 treatment according to the Guide to the 7th edition of Tiongkok
Umifenovir: umifenovir recommended for COVID-19 treatment according to Tiongkok guidance published in 7
Some antibiotics identified as potential drugs that could be given a new purpose for COVID-19 treatment:
Tocilizumab (Anti-IL-6 receptor): Approved by Tiongkok.
In addition, testing is also done in Italy and Tiongkok, see also Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
b'Vaksin COVID-19 is a hypothetic vaccine against coronary artery disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed the clinical test, there is much effort being made to develop the vaccine.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that, according to WHO, vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, a virus that is known to cause this disease, will not be available in less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates are in phase I security study in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
The great plague spread worldwide in 2020, resulting in investment and research to develop vaccines.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop vaccines that may be able to fight SARS-CoV-2.
The CEPI initiative gave a statement in April that the thing to be observed in developing vaccines is speed, production capacity, dissemination at the required scale, and global access.
In April, CEPI students reported that 10 different technology platforms were in research and development during early 2020 to make effective vaccines against COVID-19.
The main platform target advanced to Phase I security study, encompassing:
Nuclear acid (DNA and RNA) (phase I and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
virus vector (phase I development and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologicals, adenovirus vector type 5)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, with 78 confirmed as active projects (79, according to Milken Institute), and 37 others announced, but with little public information available (reputed in planning or planning).
Test phase I-II tests the initial safety and immunogenicity tests, usually done randomly, controlled placements, and at some locations, while determining more effective doses.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including control groups, and test vaccine effectiveness to prevent disease while monitoring side effects at optimal doses.
Of the 79 active vaccine candidates developed (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 were not yet in human assessment (even in the "practice" research).
On January 24, 2020 in Australia, Queensland University announced that they were investigating the potential of a molecular clamp vaccine that would genetically modify the virus protein to stimulate immune reactions.
On January 24, 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Center (VIDO-InterVac) at Saskatchewan University announced that they were starting to develop vaccines, with a human test target in 2021.

On January 29, 2020, the Janssen Pharmaceutical Company, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that they were starting to develop vaccines.
Janssen works with his biotech partner, Vaxart, to develop oral vaccines.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a production partnership with Vaxart to develop vaccines.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published the paper on vaccine design with technology similar to the technology used for neoantigen cancer vaccination therapy.
On March 25, the head of the research agency announced that they had completed vaccine synthesis and would begin testing.
On February 27, 2020, the son of Generex company, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that they started the vaccine project to make peptide vaccines Ii-Key against COVID-19.
They want to produce a vaccine candidate that can be tested on humans "in 90 days."
On March 5, 2020, Washington University in St. Louis announced its project to develop vaccines.
On March 5, 2020, the Medical Research Command and the U.S. Army Department at Fort Detrick and Walter Reed Army Research Institute at Silver Spring, both in western Maryland, announced that they were developing vaccines.

in the development and manufacture of vaccines.
Further, this partnership announced a plan for the practice and phase I clinical trials in July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that they were working on 11 isolates, and even on the fast track, vaccine development took about one and a half to two years at least.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported the development of particles like coronavirus with partial funding from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
This vaccine candidate is in laboratory research, with human testing planned in July or August 2020.
Early that week, The Guardian reported that U.S. President Donald Trump, has offered "'a large amount of money' for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine" to CureVac, which is being protected by the German government.
On March 17, 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced partnership with the German company BioNTech to develop mRNA-based vaccines together.
Currently, MRNA-based vaccine candidate, BNT162, is in the preclinical examination with clinical trials expected to begin in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020 in Italy, the Italian biotech company Takis Biotech announced that they would obtain the results of the practice test in April 2020 and the vaccine candidate at the end stage could start testing on humans in the fall.
On March 19, 2020 in France, the Pediapsian Innovation Coalition Epidemi (CEPI) announced an investment of US$4.9 million in COVID-19 vaccine research consortium involving Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Wina, Austria), and Pittsburgh University, with total ECI investment in COVID-19 vaccine development reaching US$29 million.
Another ECI investment partner for COVID-19 vaccine development is Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University, and Queensland University.
On March 20, 2020, the Russian health official announced that scientists have initiated six vaccine candidates for animals.
Imperial College London research announced on March 20, 2020 that they were developing an RNA vaccine that could improve itself for COVID-19.
Vaccine candidates were developed within 14 days after receiving a sequence from Tyeongkok.
At the end of March, the Canadian government announced a fund of $275 million for 96 medical research projects against COVID-19, which included a number of vaccine candidates at Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and University Saskatchewan initiatives.
At the same time, the Canadian government announced a fund of C$192 million special to develop COVID-19 vaccines, with plans to set up a national "vaccination bank" containing some new vaccines that can be used if another coronary outbreak occurs.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at Pittsburgh University Medical Faculty reported a PittCoVacc test, candidate for COVID-19 vaccine, on rats; they stated that "the MNA that gives vaccine subunit S1 SARS-CoV-2 causes specific antigen antigen responses that are potent [on rats] that begin to appear two weeks after immunization."
On April 16, 2020, the Faculty of Waterloo University Pharmacy announced the design of a DNA-based vaccine vaccine as a potential nasal spray.
Using bacteriophagus, DNA is designed to replicate within human bacteria to produce harmless similar particles, which can stimulate immune systems to produce antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry, and three U.S. universities gathered resources to access supercomputers from IBM, combined with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have a heterological effect, which is also called nonspecific effects.
That means that these vaccines can benefit outside of the disease prevented by it.
Further testing in Australia is being carried out by 4,170 health workers.
There is a possibility that vaccines in development will not be safe or effective.
Early study to assess vaccine honesty using specific COVID-19 animal models, such as ACE2-transgenic rats, other laboratory animals, and non-human primates, shows the need for steps to reach biological safety level 3 in dealing with live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standard safety procedures.
Vaccine against SARS and MERS has been tested on non-human animal models.
By 2020, no protective medicine or vaccine for SARS has proved safe and effective in humans.
According to research published in 2005 and 2006, identification and development of vaccines and new drugs to treat SARS is a priority for governments and community health institutions around the world.
When the MERS became prevalent, SARS research that is believed to be a useful template for developing vaccines and therapy against the MERS-CoV infection.
In March 2020, there was one MERS vaccine (based on DNA) that completed phase I clinical tests on humans, and three other vaccines were being processed, which were all virus-vector vaccines, two adenovirus-vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA-vector (MVA-MERS-S).
The social media has highlighted the conspiracy theory that claims the virus behind COVID-19 has been known before and that vaccine has been available.
Patents cited by various social media posts refer to patents that exist for genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronary galleries, such as SARS coronavirus.
b'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by coronavirus acute breathing syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and wheezing.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throats, loss of smell, and stomach pain.
Time from the appearance of the symptoms to the adjournment in general for about five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases lead to mild symptoms, some develop into virus pneumonia and fail to mural organs.
By 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases had been reported in 210 countries and territorial areas, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have been cured. This virus mainly spreads human contact when close contact occurs, often through sparks or small droplets produced through cough, sneezing, or when speaking.
Although produced when breathing, droplets usually fall to the ground or to the surface and do not become contagious up to a distance.
People can also be infected by touching contaminated surfaces and touching the eyes, nose, or mouth.
On the surface, this virus can last up to 72 hours.
This virus is very contagious for the first three days after the symptoms awitan, although the spread may occur before the symptoms appear and after the next stage of the disease. The standard diagnosis method is with the reaction of the chain polymerase transcription back real-time (rRT-PCR) on the nasopharyng usap.
The use of masks is encouraged for those suspected of being infected with viruses and for those who care for them.
Recommendations on the use of masks by public communities differ; some authorities recommend not to use masks, some recommend their use, and some recommend their use.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific antivirus treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of disease has been recorded in almost all countries in six WHO territories.
People who are infected with the virus may have no symptoms or symptoms like flu, such as fever, cough, fatigue, and wheezing.
Emergency symptoms include breathing, pain, or pain in the chest that keeps going, confusion, difficulty getting up, and face or lips that are blue; medical relief is advised immediately if these symptoms arise.
Upper respiratory symptoms, such as sneezing, swallowing, or sore throat can be found, but rarely occur.
Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea, are observed in varying percentages.
Some cases in Tyeongkok were initially only with a clinical image of chest failure and palpitation.
In some people, disease can develop into pneumonia, failure of the male organs, and death.
This time is called incubation.
Incubation times for COVID-19 are usually five to six days, but can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of those who rush will experience symptoms within 11.5 days of infection, reports show that not all those who are infected will experience symptoms.
The role of a carrier without this symptom in transmission is not fully known; however, early evidence shows that they may contribute to the spread of disease.
Currently, the proportion of infected people who do not show symptoms is unknown and being investigated, with the Korean Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reports that 20% of all confirmed cases remain without symptoms while being treated in the hospital.
The Tiongkok National Health Commission began to include cases without symptoms in its daily case on April 1st; of the 166 infections that day, 130 cases (78%) did not show symptoms at the time of the test.
Sputum and saliva can carry a virus load on a large scale.
Talking out loud releases more sparks or droplets than normal speaking.
A study in Singapore found that unsealed cough can cause droplets to be pushed up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although this virus is usually not transmitted through the air, the United States National Academy of Sciences shows that bioaerosol transmissions may occur and air carriers placed outside the hall produce positive samples for RNA viruses.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and resuscitation of the heart (RJP), can make the secret of breathing turn into aerosols and spread through the air.
Although there is concern that the virus can spread through feces, this risk is believed to be low; the most contagious virus when people rush; even though it may occur before the symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Disease Prevention and Control Centre (ECDC) says that although it is not fully clear how easily this disease spreads, one person usually infects two to three others, and it can survive on the surface for hours to days.
Specifically, it has been found that the virus can be detected for one day on cardboard, up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and carbon-resistant steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours on copper 99%.
However, this varies according to humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergent are also effective when used properly; soap products describe a layer of virus-protective fat, trigger viruses, and release them from the skin and other surfaces.
Another disorder, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidin glukonate (surgical disinfection), is less effective.
In five out of six patients, the first sample showed the highest virus load, and the sixth patient showed the highest virus load on the second day test.
Koronavirus acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia related to the acute respiratory disease cluster in Wuhan.
All the features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are in the coronavirus that is closely related to nature.
Outside of the human body, this virus was killed by household soap, which damaged its protective bubble, SARS-CoV-2 close to the first SARS-CoV.
The lung is the most affected organ by COVID-19 because the virus accesses the inhalation cell through angiotensin 2 (ACE2) enzyme, which is the most abundant in alveolar cell type II lung.
This virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called "spike or pepmelor" to connect to ACE2 and enter the swimming cell.
Acute heart injuries were found in 12% of infected people treated in Wuhan, Thungkok, and more often in severe diseases.
High levels of cardiovascular symptoms due to systemic inflammation and immune system disorders during disease development, but acute myocardial injuries may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are expressed very high in the heart and are involved in cardiac function.
The thrombosis (31%) and vena thromboembolism (25%) were found high in COVID-19 patients in the ICU and may be associated with a bad prognosis. Autopsies in people who died because of COVID-19 found diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrates that contain lymphocytes in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropism for the epithel cell of the airway expressing ACE2, COVID-19 heavy patients have systemic hyperinflammation symptoms.
Specifically, T cells that secreted the pathogenic GM-CSF have been correlated with monositis recruitment that secretes the inflammatory IL-6 and severe lung pathology in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphosytic infiltrates have also been reported on autopsy.
WHO has published some test protocols for this disease.
The standard test method is the reaction of the polymerase chain back transcription real-time (rRT-PCR).
This test is usually performed on breath samples obtained through nasopharyng soak; however, nasal or sputum soak samples can also be used.
Generally, results are available in a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but it takes two blood samples taken within two weeks so that the results have a small time value.
Tionkok scientists are able to isolate this coronavirus tunnel and publish its genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world can develop independent polymerase chain (PCR) reaction testing to detect infection by this virus.
On April 4, 2020, the antibody test (which can detect active infection and if someone has previously been infected) was under development, but has not been used much.
The experience of the Tiongkok test showed that it was only 60 to 70%.
The FDA in the United States approved the first point-of-care test on March 21, 2020 to be used at the end of that month.
Bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacity with peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distributions were found at the beginning of infection.
Subpleural domination, craziy paving, and consolidation can occur as a result of disease progression.
A little data is available on microscopy and pathophysiology COVID-19.
The main pathology finding on autopsy is:
Makroscopies: pleurisy, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation, and pulmonary oedema
Four types of virus pneumonia damage can be observed:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pneumositis hyperplasia, large atypical pneumositis, interstisial inflammation with lymphosytic infiltration, and the formation of giant cells with many
Heavy pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar failure.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory failure syndrome (ARDS) and heavy hypoxemia.
pneumonia in the healing stage: exhausted tissue in the alveolar cavity and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive steps to reduce the possibility of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, often washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing good breathing hygiene, and avoiding touching eyes, noses, or mouths with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends that you close your mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommend using an inner elbow if tissue is not available.
Hygiene hand after coughing or sneezing is recommended.
The CDC recommends the use of a cloth cover in public places, partly to restrict transmission by people without symptoms. The social restriction strategy aims to reduce contact with people infected with many, by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and canceling large-scale meetings in public.
Restrictions also include keeping people at least six feet or six feet [1.8 m] apart.
No effective drug has yet been known to prevent COVID-19.Because vaccines in anticipation have not existed until the beginning of 2021, the main part in managing COVID-19 is trying to reduce the epidemic peak, which is known as "curva spreading".
The CDC also recommends that people wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after the toilet or when the hand looks dirty, before eating, and after the nose, cough, or sneezing.
Further CDC also recommends using an alcohol-based hand-remediation containing at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not available. In areas where commercial hand-remediation is not available, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In this formulation, antimicrobial activity comes from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; this substance is "not active for antisepsis hand".
Glycerol added as a moisture.
People are treated with supportive care, which can include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and support other vital organs that are affected.
The CDC recommends people who suspect they're carrying viruses to wear a simple face mask.
Extracorporum membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address respiratory failure problems, but the benefits are still considered.
Cleanness and lifestyle and healthy eating patterns are recommended to increase immunity.
Supportive care may be useful for those who have mild symptoms at the early stage of infection. WHO and the Tiongkok National Health Commission have issued recommendations to deal with COVID-19 sufferers treated inhaled.
Intensive caregivers and lungists in the United States have made recommendations for the care of various agencies to be free of charge, i.e., the IBCC.
Until April 2020, there's no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical power recommends parasetamol (asetaminofen) more than ibuprofen for the first line use.
Preventive action should be taken to minimize the risk of virus transmission, especially in health care settings when performing procedures that can produce aerosols, such as intubation or hand ventilation.
For the health power that treats COVID-19 sufferers, the CDC recommends placing the person in the Isolation Area of Infection Tular-Udara (AIIR) other than using standard preventive action, contact prevention action, and prevention action. The CDC outlines guidelines for the use of the protective device (APD) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is: APD coat, breather or face mask, eye protection, and medical gloves. If available, breathing (not face mask) better.
The N95 respirator is approved for industry, but the FDA has authorized this mask to be used based on the U.S. Emergency Use Authorisation.
The N95 respirator is designed to protect from dust-like airborne particles, but effectiveness against certain biological agents is not guaranteed for use that is not specified in the label.
If masks are not available, CDC recommends using face protection or, as a last resort, make masks.
Most COVID-19 cases are not too heavy to require mechanical ventilation or alternative ventilation, but some cases are heavy.
The type of respiratory support for those who experience breath failure related to COVID-19 is being investigated for those who are treated inhaled, and there is evidence that intubation can be avoided with high flow canals or bipositive air duct pressure.
Whether one of these two methods results in the same benefit to those who are critically ill is not known.
Some doctors prefer to continue to use invasive mechanical ventilation when available, because this technique restricts the diffusion of aerosol particles compared to high flow canals, and a heavier case occurs in the elderly (those over 60 years of age, and especially those over 80 years of age).
Many advanced countries don't have adequate per-capita hospital beds, which limit the capacity of the health system to deal with the sudden increase in the number of COVID-19 cases that are quite severe so that it needs to be taken care of.
A study in Tiongkok found that 5% entered intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support, and 1.4% died.
In Tiongkok, about 30% of the COVID-19 sufferers who were treated inhaled eventually entered the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complicated as acute breathing syndrome (ARDS) occurs at COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes increasingly difficult.
Ventilator capable of performing pressure control and high PEEP modes is required to maximize oxygen delivery at the same time as minimizing the risk of lung injury and pneumotoraks related to the ventilator.
A high PEEP may not be available on old fans.
Research on potential treatment begins in January 2020 and some antivirus drugs are under clinical trial.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new drug development may take up to 2021, some of the drugs being tested have been approved for other uses or have been in further testing.
Antivirus drugs can be tried on people with severe disease.
The volunteers recommended by WHO are also involved in testing the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments. The FDA has granted temporary authorization for the convalescent plasma as an experimental treatment in the case of a person's life is very or equally threatened.
Convalsen plasma has not yet conducted a clinical study that is necessary to prove its safety and efficacy for this disease.
In February 2020, Tiongkok launched a mobile app to deal with this disease epidemic.
The user is asked to enter their name and ID number.
This application is able to detect 'close contact' using surveillance data so that it can detect potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If potential risks are detected, the application not only recommends independent quarantine, but also informs local health officials. Advanced analysis on cell data, facial recognition technology, cell tracking, and artificial intelligence used to track infected people and those who are in contact with them in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
By March 2020, the Israeli government allowed the security body to track down the cell phone of the suspected coronavirus.
It was taken to treat quarantine and protect people who might be exposed to infected citizens.
In addition, in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom distributed the telephone location data aggregate to the German federal government body, Robert Koch Institute, in order to investigate and prevent the spread of viruses.
Russia uses facial recognition technology to detect quarantine offenders.
Italy's regional health commissioner Giulio Gallera said he was told that "40% of the citizens are still moving around".
The German government is hacking at the end of the week 48 hours with more than 42,000 participants.
In addition, President Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a global call for creative solutions against the spread of coronavirus.
People may experience stress as a result of quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of infection themselves.
BBC quotes Rory O'Connor as saying, "Raising social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress, and economic downfall is a perfect storm that endangers mental health and the welfare of society."
This disease can last mildly or without symptoms, which resemble other common respiratory diseases, such as pills.
A mild case usually heals within two weeks, while those with severe illness or crisis may need three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may have a higher risk for COVID-19 infection based on data from similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 is still low. In some people, COVID-19 can affect the lungs so it causes pneumonia.
In the most severe affected person, COVID-19 can rapidly develop into acute respiratory failure syndrome (ARDS) that causes respiratory failure, septic shock, or failure of male organs.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal blood count, and heart, kidney, and heart damage.
Blood loss, especially increased prothrombin time, was observed in 6% of COVID-19 patients treated inhaled, while renal dysfunction was seen in 4% of this group.
About 20-30% of people with a COVID-19 image showed an enzyme increase in the heart.
According to the same report, the median time between the onset of symptoms and death is ten days, with five days spent in nursery.
However, patients transferred to the ICU have a median period of seven days between nurse inap and death.
In a study of early cases, median time from early to death symptoms is 14 days, with a range of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) Tiongkok, men have 2.8% deaths, while women have 1.7% deaths.
Histopathological testing of postmortem lung samples showed diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid failure in both lungs.
Change in siteopathic virus observed on pneumocytes.
Pulmonary images resemble acute breathing syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% deaths reported by the Tiongkok National Health Commission, observed heart damage, with increase in troponin levels or cardiac arrest.
According to the March data from the United States, 89 percent of the people who are treated have their own condition, and the availability of medical and social economic resources in a region can also affect mortality.
Mortality estimates vary due to differences in the region, but also due to methodological difficulties.
Few light case counts can cause death counts to be too high.
However, the fact that death is the result of past cases can mean that the present mortality rate is too low.
The smoker may have 1.4 times greater symptoms of severe COVID-19 and about 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or death than non-smokers.
Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a 20% to 30% decrease in lung capacity in some people recovering from disease, and lung scan showed organ damage.
It can also cause pascaper-intensive syndrome after recovery.
Until March 2020, it was not known whether previous infections provided effective and long-term immunity to those who were cured of this disease.
Immunities may be seen, if they see other coronavirus behavior, but there have been reports of a COVID-19 cure that was followed by a positive coronary test a few days after.
This case is believed to be the worst remaining infection, and not reinfection.
This virus is suspected of being natural and comes from animals, through widespread infection.
The truth is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of infection was almost entirely driven by the spread of humans to humans.
A study of 41 confirmed first COVID-19 cases, which was published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed the earliest date of the symptom awitness is 1 December 2019.
Official publication of WHO reported the earliest symptom update on December 8, 2019.
Generally, some measurements are used to calculate mortality.
The number varies according to the region and over time, and is influenced by the number of tests, quality of health care systems, management options, time since the first outbreak, and population traits such as age, gender, and overall health.
At the end of 2019, WHO set the code of ICD-10 emergency U07.1 for death from SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed laboratory and U07.2 for death from COVID-19 which was diagnosed clinically or epidemiologically without laboratory confirmation for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The death ratio of the case reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a specified time interval.
According to University statistics Johns Hopkins, the death ratio for cases globally is 6.9% (153.822/2240.191) for 17 April 2020.
The number varies according to the region. Another measure covers the fatality of the case (CFR), which reflects the percentage of those diagnosed who died from a certain disease, and the number of fatalities of the infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of those infected (diagnosis and undiagnosis) who died from a certain disease.
This statistic is not time-bound and follows a certain population from infection to case resolution.
Although not all infected people make antibodies, the existence of antibodies can provide information on the number of people who have been infected.
In the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village with 4600 citizens, 80 (1.7%) died.
In Gangelt, this disease was spread through the Carnival festival, which spread to young people, causing relatively lower mortality, and probably not all COVID-19 deaths were classified as COVID-19 deaths.
Further, the German health system has not been overrun.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population may have antibodies, as studied by blood donors.
69 people (0.004% of the population) are starving to death because of COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the mortality rate are different for men and women.
Mortality is higher in men in studies conducted in Tyeongkok and Italy.
The highest risk for men is at the age of 50, with a difference of risk between men and new women not shown at the age of 90.
In Thailand, the death toll for men is 2.8 percent and for women 1.7 percent.
The reason for the difference based on this type of sex is certain, but genetic and behavior factors may be a reason.
Immunological differences based on gender, lower prevalence of smoking among women, and men with comorbid conditions, such as hypertension, at younger ages than women can contribute to higher mortality among men.
In Europe, 57% of those infected are men and 72% of those who died because of COVID-19 are men.
Until April 2020, the U.S. government did not track data related to sex for COVID-19 infection.
Studies show that virus disease, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS, affects men and women differently.
The percentage of female sex workers, especially nurses, and they have a higher chance of developing the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of this disease is "COVID-19".
WHO leader Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explains that CO is the abbreviation for the crown, VI for the virus, D for the disease, and 19 for the first time the outbreak was identified: December 31, 2019.
The name is chosen to avoid reference to a specific geographic location (e. g. Tiongkok), animal species, or a group of people, along with an international recommendation for labelling aimed at preventing stigmatization. A virus that causes COVID-19 is named coronavirus acute heavy breathing syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 virus" in public communication.
Both the disease and the common virus are called "coronavirus".
At the beginning of the outbreak in Wuhan, Tiongkok, virus and disease are commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "coronavirus Wuhan".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCoV and acute respiratory disease 2019-nCov as a temporary name for viruses and disease according to the 2015 guidelines to avoid using the name location in the name of disease and virus.
Official name COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued on 11 February 2020.
Because of the limitations of capacity in the standard supply chain, some digital producers print health care materials such as nasal taps and fan components.
In one example, when an Italian hospital is in desperate need of a fan valve, and the buyer can't give in a timescale, a local company is looking around and printing 100 valves that are needed last night.
After the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, conspiracy theory, misinformation, and misinformation revealed about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of the disease, which spread rapidly online.
Humans seem to be able to spread viruses to some other animals.
Studies failed to find evidence of virus replication on pigs, ducks, and chickens.
There is no approved vaccine or medicine to treat this disease.
International research on vaccines and COVID-19 drugs is being carried out by government organizations, academic groups, and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched "SOLIDARITY Trial" to investigate the effects of four anti-virus compounds already present with the most promising honesty.
Vaccine is not available, but various agencies are active in developing vaccine candidates.
Previous study of SARS-CoV used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 also used ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
There are three vaccination strategies being investigated.
First, researchers aim to make vaccines whole.
The use of the virus, whether the virus is inactive or dead, aims to quickly trigger the human immune response to new COVID-19 infections.
The second strategy, the subunit vaccine, aims to create vaccines that make the immune system sensitive to certain subunits in the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the study focuses on S-spike protein that helps the virus absorb the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is a nuclear acid vaccine ( DNA or RNA vaccine, a new technique for vaccination).
On March 16, 2020, the first clinical test of a vaccine started with four volunteers in Seattle.
Vaccine contains an harmless genetic code copied from a virus that causes disease, which has been suggested as a potential challenge for the development of a SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but this method is still controversial.
There are more than 300 active clinical trials taking place in April 2020.
Seven tests tried to evaluate the treatment approved for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychonuclein or chlorokine.
The new target anti-virus drug formed most of the research into Tiongkok, with nine Phase III trials on redesivivir in some countries with reporting time at the end of April.
In April 2020, dynamic reviews of clinical development for vaccine candidates and COVID-19 drugs were already available.Some of the antivirus drugs are currently being evaluated for COVID-19, which includes redesivir, chlorokuin and hydroxychorokuin, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir combined with beta interferon.
In March 2020, there was temporary evidence for redesivir honesty.
Clinical improvement observed in patients treated with redesivir in emergency treatment.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the U.S., Tiongkok, and Italy.
However, there is a call for an intelligence review of the research.
Korean and Tiongkok Health Authority recommends the use of chlorokuin.
However, although recommending one gram daily doses, the Wuhan Virology Institute notes that twice the dose is very dangerous and can be lethal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued authorization for emergency use for hydroxychlorokuin and chlorokuin on the policy of a doctor to treat COVID-19 sufferers.Tionkok’s 7th edition also included interferon, ribavirin, or umifenovir to be used against COVID-19.
Initial data indicate that high dose ribavirin is required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoksanide has been recommended for further in vivo studies after demonstrating the limitations of SARS-CoV-2 in low concentration.Research shows that early priming of the protease protease strain by transmembran 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with ACE2 receptor.
Study of chlorokine and hydroxychlorokuin with or without azithromycin has a large limitation that has prevented the medical community from using this therapy without further research.
Siteokine storm complications can occur at the COVID-19 further step by step.
There is evidence that hydroxychlorokuin may have antistokinic properties. Tocilizumab has been placed in the medical guidelines by the Tiongkok National Health Commission after a small study has been completed.
This drug is undergoing phase 2 screening at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe disease.
Combined with serum feritin blood tests to identify siteokin storms, this drug is meant to fight siteokin storms, which are expected to cause death in some affected people.
In 2017, interleukin-6 receptor antagonists were approved by the FDA based on a retrospective case study for the treatment of siteokin-refractory steroid release syndrome induced by different causes, namely CAR T cell therapy.
So far, no random and controlled evidence has shown that tocilizumab is a good treatment for CRS.
Transferring the purified and bonded antibodies produced by the system of people who have recovered from COVID-19 to those who need it is being studied as a passive non-vaccination immunization method.
This strategy was tested for SARS with non-conclusive results.
Virus neutralization is a work mechanism that is expected for passive antibodies therapy to mediate defense against SARS-CoV-2.
However, another mechanism, such as cellular sitotoxicity that depends on antibodies and/or phagositosis, is also possible.
Another passive antibodies therapy, for example, uses monoclonal antibodies that are produced, is being developed.
The production of the convalescent serum, which is part of the blood of patients who have recovered and contain specific antibodies to this virus, can be improved for faster use.
Coronavius disease, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at the Wuhan Center Hospital, who then became infected and died because of COVID-19 after the onset of consciousness would spread the virus.
