At the end of the trade, Prague's grant goes down in the negative
After the fall of Tuesday morning, the Prague Stock Exchange rectified its losses.
Transactions with ČEZ shares reached almost half of the usual daily trade.
On Tuesday, from the beginning of the trade, the Prague Stock Exchange resumed with its fall from the previous day, when it lost almost six percent.
This time, the decline is due to the decline in shares on Wall Street.
The reaction of the market to the result of the vote of the U.S. House of Representatives, which refused to adopt the stabilisation plan of the US financial sector, is also noticeable in us.
Action impact in Asia
Asian scholarships experienced a dramatic fall on Tuesday, even though the indexes succeeded in clearing up some of the losses during the day.
The Hang Seng index of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange lost four percent during the trade, but later it erased some of the losses and reduced the decrease to almost 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index following the Chinese stock movement of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange lost 3.8 percent, with the markets closed in Shanghai.
Sydney Stocks lost more than five percent, but eventually we managed to reduce losses to 4.3 percent.
According to its index, the Taiwan Stock Exchange lost 3.6 percent.
"The hesitation about US rescue action will affect the financial markets around the world," notes Joseph Yam, head of the Hongkong Monetary Office.
Although Hong Kong is part of China, it establishes its own monetary policy, i.e. independently of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are the same as in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, U.S. legislators should quickly resume negotiations and adopt the proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, other countries may be affected.
The bloodbath of American actions
On Monday, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the financial system support project, to which it should have spent up to $700 billion (approx. 12 billion Kč).
The legislators thus rejected the call for the support of President George Bush's project.
According to Bush, the project should solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
American actions live on Monday, a bloodbath and the main indexes of actions have suffered the greatest drop in the last 20 years.
The Dow Jones index lost almost seven percent, having suffered such a fall for the last time in 1987.
The index was already lost during the vote, but when it appeared that the proposal was not adopted, it was in free fall.
Congress Ceda: the US government can inject 700 billion dollars into banks
The U.S. Congress Leaders and President George W. Bush's government agreed on a broader form of the financial assistance agreement to the U.S. financial system.
It will be put to the vote next week.
The U.S. legislators made a decisive turning point in the talks on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of financial assistance of $700 billion (about 12 billion crowns) granted to the U.S. financial system.
Success is not as certain as it is.
Before they can publish the final version of the law and put it to the vote, Congressmen must complete a number of details of the agreement.
The financial system support plan will be discussed in the House of Representatives on Monday.
Says Reuters Barney Frank, chairman of the House's Banking and Financial Regulatory Committee on Sunday.
According to sources, on Wednesday at the earliest, the plan should be submitted to the Senate in a priori.
According to economists, the announcement that the rescue plan will be adopted should be a major major psychological factor in restoring financial markets.
However, given the complexity of the mechanisms through which market aid can be effective, it will follow a "disillusion".
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made great progress.
We have settled our divergent views on the form the package should have of measures for the stabilisation of the market," entrusted Democrat Nancy Pelosi to Bloomberg Agency.
According to her, the final vote could be taken as early as Sunday.
On Saturday night to Sunday, representatives of the legislators met with US Finance Minister Henry Paulson to give the government a final form.
It should purchase from financial corporations the inventable real estate assets that result in financial undertakings in considerable losses and threaten the stability of the system as a whole.
"We are about to agree on a plan that will work and must also be effective on the market.
We still have to continue this market recovery plan, but I think we are there," says Paulson.
A signal for Asian exchanges
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on declining stock markets.
According to the Democratic Senator, does not escape Harry Reid, the legislators make the Congress reach a final agreement on Sunday.
They thus wish to calm investors before the start of trade in Asian financial markets, which are located in the first time zone, where Congress's decision could influence trade on Monday.
At the moment, however, it is impossible to state with certainty when the two Chambers of the US Congress will vote, or if negotiations are not likely to remain blocked at the last moment by any particular problem.
The legislators hope that it will be adopted in the coming days.
Nevertheless, there will still be several amendments to the law.
The total amount intended for the system shall be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion, as President George Bush wished, must be available as soon as possible.
But if the Congress will have the impression that the program does not perform its function, it has the possibility to block the grant of the remaining amount, in two steps: first, an additional $100 billion and then, finally, $350 billion.
Mr. Bush welcomed progress in the negotiations
Although the President can put his veto on this decision, the Congress, he, has the opportunity to put it into a minority.
Despite these changes, the main idea of the program, which consisted of obtaining finance for the purchase of bad real estate securities, whose value dropped, because hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to pay their mortgages, was maintained.
"All the work is done.
The House of Representatives should be able to proceed on Sunday to vote on the bill, and the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
U.S. President George Bush himself is pleased with the progress made in the negotiations.
His spokesman Tony Fratto stated that Mr. Bush was pleased with the progress made on Saturday and appreciated "the bipartite effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy".
Limitation of golden parachutes
The president of the Senate bank committee Christopher Dodd, chief negotiator, said that the legislators agreed on the responsibility of the financial program, the protection of contributors against losses, the discount agreement, the development of the plan on the axis of time.
The new Act also provides for the limitation of these golden parachutes for directors of the companies participating in the program and establishes a committee, which will monitor the fund.
The latter should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on this issue and made important progress towards an agreement that will work and will be effective for the market and for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also provides for aid for real estate owners, who have problems to pay.
The government should negotiate new payments in the case of mortgages that it will redeem, while reducing debtor monthly payments and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological aid
According to the economist leader of Patria Finance David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but its achievement will be very difficult.
"And this is due to the fact that we do not know what will be the mechanism and the price of repurchase of assets with problems.
This point will be decisive to decide on the loss sharing between the financial sector and the government," says Marek, this week, to the iHNed.cz server.
If the plan will be adopted now, or at the beginning of next week, it is not, according to Marek, so important that it is.
"It is much more important that the congressmen agree, as of this week, that they support this plan and that they will devote it as soon as possible.
This psychological significance of the agreement, providing for the adoption of the plan, matters the most at the moment," underlined Marek.
Extremely pushed fight: MP3 players against mobiles.
We'll advise you, how to choose
While virtually all mobiles can read MP3 files, no MP3 player can call.
It seems clear from this that it is better to buy only one phone.
There are sufficient reasons to obtain an independent reader.
The choice depends entirely on the manner of use and the requirements of the future owner.
It would be absurd to buy for the house a high-end expensive gramophone to put the new album of Maxim Turbulenc.
On the one hand, such musical products do not come out on vinyl discs, and, from the point of view of quality, there is no objective reason for this to happen.
Now, if there are tied vinyl discs in your shelves, with rock art, jazz or blues, you probably dream at least of such a gramophone.
The same is true of music during travel, i.e. compressed music, to say it in a simplified way - music in MP3.
There are also categories based on price and quality.
For one, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for a reader, just as a Pink Floyd fan would have a hard time supporting listeners purchased for twenty crowns in the market.
These are two extremes, among which there is enough room for everyone.
The choice is broad.
The life span of batteries is also decisive
Some high-end music readers are capable of much more than just reading music, but these are, of course, unknown functions of most mobiles.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to the first functions, telephone calls and text sending, it is able to read music and movies, record them, it has a variable quality camera and can, for example, even be used for navigation.
And if you take into account smartphones and communicators, you'll have a small computer in your pocket.
Since no refrigerator knows how to grill meat and no television will take photographs, we are almost witnessing a miracle.
However, the universal character of the mobile is not without drawbacks.
The larger the number of functions you use, the greater the interval between two reloads will be reduced.
And the reading of music is one of the most important energy goinfrosts.
There are few mobiles that are able to read music for ten to twelve hours, in most cases this figure is significantly lower.
In this respect, music readers (especially the most rudimentary) are significantly more effective.
In the case of cheap mobiles, count that they will only play music for a few hours.
If, in addition, you get to call from time to time, get yourself a second reload for the job - this is even valid for the most expensive devices.
The problem will not arise for MP3 players, who are capable, following a reloading, of continuous operation of at least 9 hours, including the least performing.
Another problem occurs when recording music in mobile.
Unfortunately, that a limited part of the devices has a universal USB connector, especially since not everyone can be directly connected to the computer, without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but few card readers know how to take it without reduction, given the tiny size of the memory cards used in mobile cards.
With regard to readers, you do not need any software except iPod.
It is enough to complete, through the USB connector, the music device from the computer.
Most mobiles and readers will create themselves a media library classified by the name of the interpreter, the title of the album, style, or then by the user's judgment.
Some devices display only one index with a tree structure, in the way Windows Explore it, others are capable of both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent phones with operating system).
The readers are easier to handle, the mobiles have more know-how
In the choice of a concrete device, focus mainly on the life of the accumulator, memory capacity, quality and type of output of the sound and, of course, the ease of the control.
If the music is for you, essentially, a background noise and if in the day you will listen to it that for a limited time, for example by taking the tram, you just need any mobile reading the MP3s.
Virtually all mobiles are capable of it today.
You do not even have to pay too much attention to the music formats that the mobile or reader is able to read.
Everyone can read the MP3s and the vast majority of the music that will reach you until you have this format.
It is one of the most popular formats and apart from it, the vast majority of devices also come to read WMA music.
The AAC (format used by the Apple firm and its iPods) is less common for it.
High-end mobiles also allow, for example, the purchase of online music.
Simply visit the corresponding operator's (or other supplier's) web pages from the mobile phone and purchase the song or album in question.
This service alone should be a convincing reason for obtaining a musical motive.
The offer of operators is unfortunately miserable and is, in most cases, limited to fast-made tubes.
The prices are not even the lowest.
However, it is generally considered that this way of buying music (whether via GSM, internet, or even wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry their mobile on themselves.
Every time you want to listen to something, you just have to get the mobile out of your pocket, while you forgot your MP3 player at home.
But it is also important if you always have on you headphones or handfree with connection.
If this is not the case, you can use the built-in frames, which have virtually all the mobile phones, but a minimum of MP3 players.
For many, the main advantage of musical furniture is their price.
The least expensive normally cost less than three thousand.
For a price of three four thousand crowns, we can have a walkman already very convenient.
However, in most cases you will be limited by the lack of output for ordinary headphones.
The price of the best telephones and the best used, also equipped with an entrance for ordinary headphones, does not exceed fifteen thousand.
Readers, on the other hand, have the advantage of having an easy order.
Truly anyone who manages the most rudimentary readers - which do not necessarily correspond to the least expensive ones (see our choice).
A minimum of functions; and the similarity of the order with that of a cassette post, commonly used in the past, or a gramophone, is obvious.
There is no risk of collision in the form of a mobile internet connected by chance, followed by a huge data transmission invoice.
Which device to choose from
Even the cheapest mobiles (e.g. Vodafone 527) generally have an interchangeable memory card slot (type M2, microSD, and so on).
Even taking into account the additional purchase of such a card, you will not exceed two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
The basic models only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive come out with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a Cown, a Creative, a Sony, a Samsung, an Emgeton, or an iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you should not spend more than 1,100 crowns.
If you are among the most demanding auditors, choose specialized mobile-walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices are equipped with independent command keys for MP3, and this is how the ease of the command approaches that of an independent MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose walkman series mobiles have the same user menu as MP3 players sold separately, is the one who went further in this area.
The same service, in the same price category, but with a memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and a life of the accumulator (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours) higher, is ensured by an MP3 player produced by one of the above mentioned brands.
A first virtual operator will win Czechia this year.
Maybe.
The mobile market in Czech Republic is relatively advanced, our operators offering virtually the same services as their partners in Western Europe.
Despite this, we still lack something - a virtual operator, which would force classic operators to lower prices.
Maybe he won't be missing for long.
We have already mentioned, on many occasions, the fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
The ČTÚ (The Czech Telecommunications Office), which reported that the price of a SMS was higher in us than in the rest of the Union, confirmed it.
As a result of the latest steps taken by the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming fees, a paradoxical situation is likely to occur - SMS sent from abroad will be for some customers of Czech mobile operators less expensive than in the country.
How is it possible that prices in Czech Republic are maintained so high, compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that would really want to enter the fight.
This may seem paradoxical, given that we still have three mobile networks and a penetration that is well above 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this regard, Pavel Dvořák, the President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTÚ), who has stated on several occasions that there was no room for another operator in Czech Czech telecommunications office (ČTÚ) in Czech Czech Republic, which has been coerced with the operators.
It is likely that a classic operator with its own network has no longer seemed to have much chance (in fact, now it would find only hardly frequencies).
But there is still a possibility - a virtual operator.
It was precisely the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that led to a substantial fall in prices, to which conventional operators were also to react.
However, even before the entry of the parties such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile into the market, voices similar to those heard today at home were heard in Britain.
However, it appeared that there was still room for such operators and that they could have a real success.
We are not obliged to go too far to find examples.
In February we informed you of the launch of the Virtual Mobilking operator in Poland.
In just six months, this operator managed to earn more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth operator in the country.
Let's add that behind Mobilking, there's the Penta financial group, which has, among other things, the U:phone in Czech.
The advantage of virtual operators is that it is possible to focus on a much more concrete target group.
For their operation to be effective, they actually need much less customers than a conventional operator.
They are, in fact, exempt from the relatively high costs of construction, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
This is why in the world, virtual operators profile themselves as low-cost operators - they offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often counterbalanced by a limited offer of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile offers text messages in Britain at least twice as expensive as its competitors.
However, as shown by the example of Mobilking in Poland, placing on an unusual target group can also be a good shot of advertising.
Indeed, this operator specifically targets men.
"The real men choose Mobilking - an operator they like and whom they can trust," says David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, operating this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say, if such a concept would also be able to walk at home.
Miroslav Čepický, the spokesman for Vodafone, doubts: "The Czech market is relatively small for a segmental approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
Especially since it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the supply of services."
In Czech Republic, no chance, say mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual operator in Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are discussing the successful expansion of this project, but in Czech negotiations are not very encouraging.
The launch of Mobilking will take place in other countries in our area," said in a telephone interview for Mobil.cz Jana Studničková, spokesperson for the Penta financial group.
It thus indirectly confirmed that operators in Czech Republic were not, in any case, in favour of this idea.
On the contrary, they are trying to make every effort to prevent a potential competitor from appearing.
The GTS Novera group, who would like to take a new step in order to become a real competitor of Telephonika in the business customer field, has not been hiding, for long enough, its intention to launch a virtual mobile operator.
"We have a lot to be able to offer our customers not only fixed but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner the better.
We have already conducted negotiations on this possibility on several occasions with all Czech mobile operators.
With some, we have succeeded in the negotiations," said the spokesperson of the Pavel Kaidl group.
So the future may be promising.
According to unofficial information, it seems that we might be able to welcome the first virtual operator by the end of the year.
But for the moment, his creation is accompanied by total silence.
"At the moment, we do not believe that there is room in the Czech market for a virtual operator as such.
The Czech market is in comparison with other very specific markets.
At the moment, no subject with a complex and serious project in this area has contacted us," said Vlastimil Sršeň of the Press Department of Telephonika O2, in his statement for Mobil.cz.
Other operators also relate to the specificity of the Czech market.
The spokesperson for T-Mobile Martina Kemrová stated in a rare agreement with O2's statement: "We have not yet registered a viable and bilaterally advantageous project, which could serve as a basis."
And she adds: "It is practically excluded that a virtual operator appears in the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
To operate in such a limited time, we should now have a concrete agreement."
Vodafone instead directs its attention to the completion of requests to obtain its own 3G licence.
Miroslav Čepický says in relation to this: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and especially in the area of shared costs and infrastructure.
That is what we think means the most from a client's point of view.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is the discovery of a partner to establish a common network for a fast mobile internet."
Responsible authorities: in phase with operators
The mobile operators' approach is easily understandable, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would have led to a decrease in prices and thus a decrease in their profits.
So what good is it to facilitate the advent of such a competitor?
When it comes to their interests, operators know how to feel like larvae in the fair. The chicane accompanying the creation of the U:phone also testifies to it.
The greatest apparent pressure on the ČTÚ, when creating the U:fon, was that exercised by the T-Mobile company.
This demonstrates information available to the public from the ČTÚ web pages.
Today, however, the U:fon is willing to serve as an argument not to accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová noted in this regard: "Competition on the mobile market has also been recently enhanced by the entry into the market of a fourth mobile operator.
Given the character of the RT mobile market, it is clear that the entry of an additional player would, and above all its services, subject it to high requirements."
But given the attitude of the mobile operators here, the indifference of the Czech regulators seems disconcerting.
However, it is not just the attitude of ČTÚ, which, unlike Britain and other developed countries, has unfortunately not the power to intervene in the economic competition in Czech Republic.
It belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (UOHS).
However, the latter adopts, in the face of this problem, its typical position.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible following the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the relevant virtual operator concerning the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No such agreement has been concluded at the moment, because the offer of potential stakeholders has not previously presented sufficient interest for conventional operators," he said in response to our question Kristián Chalupa of the UOHS Department of External Relations.
A statement made in this way would not surprise representatives of the operators.
But on the part of an office, which must represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, also take care, that no one takes advantage of its position on the market, such a declaration is more than misleading.
Even more so as Kristián Chalupa adds: "In other countries, where virtual operators are normally present, it can be seen that their entry into the market has contributed to lower prices for mobile phone services."
However, pressure towards an honest functioning of the market and lower prices is apparently not part of UOHS' interests.
What is actually shocking is the almost touching agreement of the three mobile operators, which stems from their reactions.
The question, if it really is a coincidence, naturally arises.
In the same way, a price of gasoline strictly identical to all service stations is probably due to chance and tough competition.
"The Office has not identified signs of anti-competitive behaviour in this respect, so it has no reason to intervene in one way or another.
None of the operators have a dominant position, none therefore have an increased corresponding responsibility for their behaviour on the market.
The tools needed to open the mobile market to virtual operators are probably even lacking the telecommunications regulator," said Chaloupa in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many points of disagreement.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by the ČTÚ that telecommunications constitutes, from the point of view of economic competition, a single market.
None of the Czech operators have a dominant position on such a market.
However, some law experts propose another view of things: for the creation of a virtual operator to be possible, the consent of the network operator must be obtained at each time.
And the mobile operator quite logically has the monopoly on its network.
This is how it necessarily plays a dominant role in a certain segment of its activity.
However, even without admitting this argument, it should be at least worrying for the UOHS that three mobile operators proceed visibly in a similar manner.
However, complaints from many interested parties (including GTS Novera, mentioned above) show that they face similar constraints in negotiations with all operators.
Taking responsibility for the ČTÚ is a fairly common turn in communications, through which UOHS washes its hands.
We have already met this type of attitude in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, it has not been possible to introduce the recently adopted Telecommunications Act in the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although many specialists promised to improve the situation.
This, the representatives of the UOHS must know very well, but their interests seem to be somewhere else.
When no one looks, it can work
However, the operation of some kind of virtual pseudo-operators, many in Czech mobile networks, remains unseen.
These are companies publishing their own price lists of mobile telephone services, but they are only partly public.
In most cases, companies dealing with multi-level marketing are involved.
For example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer specialized mobile phone services.
The price lists of these companies generally reach only elected ones.
The magic tower consists of the fact that the company faces the operator is a classic company customer, who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, she gets special (and other) price offers.
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such resale.
"If what you're referring to happened, it could be a breach of the contractual conditions that we're going to consider and that could lead to an end to collaboration with the society in question," answered our question about this Martina Kemrová problem.
However, it is unlikely that an echo of such an activity will not reach the managers of mobile operators.
Especially in the case of the three companies mentioned it can be thousands of customers.
No operator, however, is against such a procedure.
In fact, the activities of these companies bring them non-negligible benefits, and at the same time, as opposed to real virtual operators, they do not threaten them with their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický points out the possible problems: "The law allows such speculations, however, the services of these companies are used only by a percentage of negligible customers.
In addition, they are forced to admit that the SIM card on their phone is not registered under their name, so they cannot fully dispose of it, in the manner of ordinary customers of mobile operators."
But that is precisely what should seem strange to the ČTÚ.
In addition, another question is asked at UOHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes on such a procedure, why do they block the creation of a virtual operator?
It should be added that the UOHS has relatively broad powers to reveal such an activity, and if it does not wish to be satisfied with the explanations of the operators, who claim to have no idea that this would happen, their contractual conditions forbid it.
When we are no longer the most expensive country
As we have mentioned on several occasions, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has led to a substantial decrease in the price of services.
However, practically in all countries where virtual operators appeared, traditional operators were trying, sometimes less, to prevent their creation.
The arguments used by the latter were practically the same - a market too small or even too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
However, it was precisely at this level that the regulatory bodies in developed countries, which defended not the interests of mobile operators, but those of their customers, were involved.
Both by formal measures and by informal pressure, they eventually obtained the creation of a first virtual operator, followed by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators deal with this issue in the way of a hot potato that is disposed of by transmitting it to a nearby target.
As a result of the experiences we have, we can only get rid of the impression that confusion in skills is more than profitable in these cases.
But let's not throw the handle after the cog.
If the flow information says true and a virtual operator will soon appear in our home, the Czech mobile market may be in motion.
If one of the operators accepted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, the UOHS could hardly remain impassible in the face of rejection (discrimination) of other stakeholders.
And perhaps we will stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four achievements of the new Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, on Czech National Day, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek solemnly presented the new recordings of the national anthem Kde domov mönj (Where is my homeland?).
The anthem was again recorded by the national theatre orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
We have four versions - with a male or female solo song, a choir interpretation and an instrumental version.
The song is provided by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
Otakar Jeremiaš and Jaroslav Krček are the authors of the anthem's arrangements.
You can listen to the four new versions on the iHNed.cz server.
Bělohlávek considers Czech national singing as one of the most beautiful hymns.
As he had previously entrusted to Český rozhlas (Czech public radio), he chose for the interpretation of solo versions of singers with young and representative voices, which are marked and appreciated.
"From the beginning, I was trying to take care that the two singers, as well as the choir, have a good dictionary, so that we understand the words well, that they sing simultaneously," he said.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate next year's 175th anniversary.
For the first time in 1834, Kde domov played on the boards of Stavovské divadlo (the State Theatre) in Fidlovačka (Kermesse des savetiers), a Czech original piece by Josef Kajetán Tyl, accompanied by the music of František Škroup.
It became popular and people spontaneously appropriated it.
After the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first couplet naturally became an integral part of the national anthem.
It remained one of the seven national symbols even after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
How the "new" hymn sounds
The pragmatic public transport (MHD) will introduce the chip into their ticketing system on Wednesday
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be recorded in the history of the Pražský Dopravní podnik (the Pragosa Agency for Transport) as the date on which the first passengers, trams and buses, who, instead of having a paper ticket, will have an electronic coupon in their pocket.
At the moment, it is accessible to approximately 100,000 people, owners of the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy a coupon 30 days or 90 days (this will be valid from 1 January 2009) and both have it registered on their smartcard at the information points and offices of Dopravní podnik (the Transportation Agency), located at the Muzeum metro stations, Mëstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajskázahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
From yesterday, there is also the possibility of buying coupons over the Internet on the Dopravní pondnik web pages: www.dpp.cz.
Over four hundred people took advantage of the service in the morning.
Those who will start using the online store may permanently forget the windows in the metro stations, where they have to walk impatience in long queues so far in order to obtain paper tickets.
Indeed, they will buy their coupons over the Internet and they will be registered on their Opencard card in one of the 13 Městská knihovna (municipal libraries).
"In these contact points, there is at the disposal of passengers a window with trained staff, which will help interested people with internet purchase and, in addition, will record the coupon they bought on their map," says the spokesperson for the Martin Opatrný project.
In addition to the libraries, it will also be possible to record the electronic coupons on the Opencard in automatic distributors installed in the vestibule of several metro stations.
What do these distributors look like?
They are red, recalling the machines to compose tickets and passengers may have already noticed them in the stations of metro Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Today, the city has five, but by the end of the year, there should be eighty," said Opatrný.
An automatic will control the coupon instead of the driver
The machines that will work from tomorrow are easy to use.
Just insert the Opencard chip card and the previously purchased coupon will register itself on the card.
Electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital but also in the vicinity of the city.
In the peri-urban trains and bus lines 300 to 499, which mainly use the inhabitants of the municipalities of Central Bohemia to access the capital.
"In the integrated trains in Pražská integrovana doprava (integrated transports from Prague), controllers are equipped with card readers, using which they establish the temporary and zonal validity of the coupons;" explained the control of the Filip Drápal tickets of the Ropid organization, which designs the schedules of the public transport in praganos.
Periurban buses are equipped with cards readers integrated into the driver's safe.
During boarding it is therefore necessary not only to show the driver the chip card, but also to place the Opencard at the place indicated on the side of the case.
This is how the driver controls the validity of the registered coupons.
"In case the passenger needs to verify the validity of the registered coupons, there is nothing more simple than asking the driver for this information," Drápal added.
Passengers who do not take peri-urban buses and will not remember the date on which the coupon expires, can reach the automatic distributors again, initially used to record the coupons on the map.
This is where, on the device screen, the information about the validity of their document will appear.
The South Africans called for a referendum in the USA
In 1945, the South Germans called for Šumava to be integrated into the United States.
This stems from a letter filed in the collections of the Jihočeská vědecká knihovna (The Southern Bohemian Scientific Library).
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want at least to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
In 1945, some groups of South Germans allegedly addressed the President of the USA with such a desire.
This stems from a letter preserved in a private archive, which is now deposited in the collections of the Jihočeská vědecká knihovna.
Germans from Český Krumlov ask in the letter the American president not to allow "šumavská župa" (forest region south of Bohemia) - annexed by Hitler under the Munich agreement - to be returned to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation and want to be truly sure that the words proclaiming that the American troops come to German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," is written in the letter, signed "People, whom the fate of Šumava is at heart."
Since the accession to Czechoslovakia is allegedly promising - by knowing the Czech national character - only of brutality, attitude without regard, misunderstanding, oppression and servitude, the authors of the letter ask the American president to take the protection of Šumava for now and forever.
"We cannot believe, that you would grant this territory to a foreign state to us, which oppresses and destroys minorities and has not contributed to the Allies' victory without considering the opinion of the quarter of millions of people," is written in the letter.
The alleged reason why the authors cannot sign the letter is the fear of the desire for revenge of the "Czech oppressors".
If the president of the USA questioned the opinion of the Germans of Šumava, he would only have to organize, according to the authors of the letter, a referendum in the region to determine whether his inhabitants wanted to be part of the USA, or live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text contained in the letter may, in view of the current knowledge of post-war history, seem somewhat naive, according to some survivors, it well illustrates the expectations of the Germans of the Southeasts of the time.
While the Czech Germans had to at least think that the question of their expulsion from the Republic would arise, very few of them admitted such an opportunity.
Some hoped that the United States and Great Britain would obtain some kind of autonomy for the South.
Others thought they'd just stay in Czechoslovakia.
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice, confirmed this.
During the war, it was, as German of Česke Budějovice, engaged in the Navy in the Baltic countries.
When he was captured by the English at the end of the war and placed in the catch camp of the Holstein region, dozens of Czech Germans came to see him to teach them the Czech.
"They believed that once they returned home, the Czech would benefit them," said Chalupa.
None of the captured Germans who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war believed that, following the Beneš Decrees, he would be expelled from the republic.
You don't think - you pay!
An emotional campaign will attack drivers
The most expensive road safety action in Czech history.
A way to characterize the emotional media campaign that is intended to launch, Wednesday, the Ministry of Transport.
Minister Aleš's office is of the opinion that she will discourage drivers from driving dangerous behaviour.
This campaign costing 150 million will appear on television, radio, cinema, on the Internet, but also on tracts.
It should discourage drivers from driving fast and driving alcohol.
But also remind them to take the belt before starting.
It wants to touch the conscience of young drivers, bikers, pedestrians, not forgetting professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Especially personal stories that will attack emotions.
This is also evidenced by the "sangling" slogan of the entire campaign:
You don't think - you pay!
The phrase "You do not think" is inserted in capital letters on the registration plate.
Then, in a flame of blood, there's the phrase "You'll pay."
Which must symbolize that one can pay for life for a moment of attention.
The spots will "shock" the spectators until 2010.
The ministry has been inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where images are commonly seen with drastic images of accident victims.
It is estimated that this will result in a decrease in the rate of accidents and the number of deaths on the Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
The strategy of sugar and whip against drivers
"The one who walks with the drivers is the system of sugar and whip.
For them, sugar is represented, for example, by gaining time, when they grill a red fire.
The whip is the threat of a fine or an accident.
The risks must be reminded to the drivers," said Martin Kořán, the transportation psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
This is how we need information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertisements, the psychologist believes.
Panels reporting the danger to drivers are already less effective.
"When a static panel that warns against danger is installed, it will probably soon merge with the environment and drivers will not notice it," Kořán said.
Olmert would make peace in exchange for almost all the occupied territories
Ehud Olmert, the President of the Israeli Interim Government, expressed support for the restoration of virtually all occupied territories in 1967, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He made this statement in an interview published on Monday by the daily Yedioth Ahronoth.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to make almost all territories (occupied), even all," Olmert said daily.
"We will keep a certain percentage of the territory, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage (of the Israeli territory), since without it peace will not be made," he added.
He admitted that the possible refund would include East Jerusalem.
"He who desires security in Jerusalem, and above all does not want tractors and bulldozers to crush his feet, as it happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem," Olmert noted, alluding to the two attacks in the city, in July, when several people were killed and dozens of people injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mountain, the sacred and historical places" located within the Old City.
"He who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will be forced to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he later emphasized.
Retreat of the heights of the Golan
Olmert also spoke in favour of Israel's retirement from Golan heights, which he felt was an essential condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also require certain efforts on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose to conclude peace with Syria only on the basis of a retreat from the Golan," he said.
"The Syrians know very well what they will have to give up in order to get the Golan.
They will have to renounce their current relations with Iran; they will have to renounce their relationship with the Hezbollah (Shiite Movement); they will have to give up their constant support to Hamas terrorism (Shiite Movement), Al-Kaida (Terrorist Network), as well as the Djihad (Holy War) in Iraq," said the Prime Minister.
Questions that arise after the accident: Are Stewards in the cause illegal?
The law ignores them; walking in a long distance car is prohibited
In the context of the tragic accident of the Student Agency bus near Padua, Italy, the question arose whether the drivers and passengers can travel on the journey inside the bus.
"If we wanted to comply with the law strictly and formally, the activity of a steward is contrary to the Road Traffic Act," said the spokesperson for the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in question, during which a 22-year-old hostess died, was apparently caused by the driver of a truck that crossed the road to the bus.
The girl was at the moment unfortunately sitting next to the driver, on the most dangerous seat of the vehicle, although she has two other seats at her disposal.
However, the bus may have an accident, or even a sudden brake, also when the steward serves coffee or distributes newspapers.
What matters is whether the bus is under its technical sheet equipped with standing places or not.
If this standing-place equipment is not approved, passengers must remain seated.
The long distance buses Student Agency do not have standing seats; this was confirmed at Aktuálně.cz by the director of Radim Jančura.
"It's a question we've dealt with with with with the department and, at first, it prohibits any movement of passengers.
Then they cancelled it and we got that passengers can go to the toilet during the trip provided they have their own seat," he explained.
The law ignores the steward
"There is no single legal interpretation of the role of steward - no legal requirement deals with this role.
On the other hand, no legal requirement also prohibits the carrier from offering services.
The Road Transport Act knows only the term vehicle receiver; it does not define its rights and duties," adds the spokesperson Hanzelka with more ambiguity.
On the contrary, Josef Pokorný, director of the Road Traffic Department, believes that the law deals sufficiently with the problem.
"It all depends on whether the bus has permission to offer standing seats in its approval.
It's all in there," he says.
Buses are divided into urban areas, where there are standing places and a maximum speed limited, long-distance with standing places and a higher permitted speed and in long distance buses without standing with the highest maximum permitted speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
As on the plane, says an expert
Jaroslav Hořín, expert at BESIP (safety of road traffic) in transport safety, does not see the movement of the drivers on board as a major problem.
"During regular traffic, there is no danger. The situation can be compared to that of service on planes.
Nor is it certain when turbulence occurs and the hostess of the air can form its head."
"But in the event that the bus had suddenly stopped, the laws of physics would obviously be valid.
In the same way as in an urban bus or tram.
The carrier must manage the safety of the stewardess by internal requirements," he said, and also believes that from the point of view of the law, the problem is not resolved.
Jančura is ready to remove these services
Student Agency is the only bus carrier to offer steward services.
He hires two hundred.
Even after this accident, the Director does not consider their job to be a risky job.
"However, as soon as I get the impression that this is a risky job, I will delete it.
Passengers can receive their coffee and newspaper at boarding.
It would also reduce costs," he said.
Safety concerns are the reason why the director of Asiana Alexei Litvina, who provides, in comparison with SA, a very small number of lines, is not in his vehicles.
"We have no hosts, we have opposed them from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end with a fatal accident," he said, a year ago, at Týden.cz.
A huge tragedy has arrived
A young hostess from the Plzeň region, who had been working for society for two years, died during the accident on the Naples line.
A Slovenian truck probably left the emergency stop band without using a blinker and blocked the way to the bus.
The driver of the driver tried to avoid it by means of a sudden manoeuvre, but he froze it on his right side.
Jančura refuses to sell both seats reserved for the steward's rest.
"In the case of long distance lines, it is not possible to reserve these places, they are blocked."
The company intends to file a complaint against the driver of the truck.
For the compensation of the girl's family, the agency will not wait for the court's judgment, but also for financial compensation.
An amendment to the law?
Not in sight
An amendment of the law, which has been being developed for more than a year by a group of 30 experts from the Ministry of Transport, could provide details on the movement of the bus drivers.
"But it did not lead to any conclusion on this point.
In fact, she does not care too much about the buses, but rather about the point system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of the mobile phone at the wheel," said expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the stewardess as something that would fundamentally endanger the safety of passengers," concludes the spokesperson Hanzelka, stating that the control of the safety of buses is under the authority of the police and the Office for Safety at Work.
The hopes of the Düsseldorf used to rest on Frankfurt.
The main words were not missing in the letter addressed by the WestLB Steering Committee to household employees.
By a union of the financial institutions of Düsseldorf with the Deka-Bank of Frankfurt, "the central financial market institution of the Sparkasse financial group" could form, according to the letter made public on Monday.
WestLB would bring a double "block of competence" of sustainable productivity in such a case.
All in all, such a relationship could be the decisive move towards other concentrations in the Länder banking sector.
This is what it looks like when a steering committee wants to demonstrate its capacity for action in difficult times.
Because WestLB, wounded, is always under great pressure.
Not only the European Commission, but also the Federal Financial Services Surveillance Authority, which has only recently made it clear to the Government of the Land of North Rhine-Westphalia that time was counted in the search for a future solution.
However, for some time now it has been a question - also on the Frankfurt side - of a relationship of some form between the Deka Bank, which knows Sparkasse customers through their investment funds, and the WestLB.
The head of the Deta-Bank Franz Waas indicated during the presentation of the figures in late August that he saw no sense in the merger of the Mainzer Landstrasse house with a Land bank, whether Helaba or WestLB.
However, the Deka Board of Directors, each of which is supported by the banks of the Länder and groups of savings banks, has commissioned the Steering Committee to conduct talks with WestLB for common commercial activities.
It could then be the flow of the financial market, or parts thereof.
However, the talks have only just begun, we say in the financial place.
This is not the first time that the DETA-Bank, with its 3000 employees, has one of the most important employers in Frankfurt's financial space, is at stake as a result of the consolidation of the savings bank sector.
In 2003, it was believed for a time that the Deta-Bank could merge with the Land Bank of Rhineland Palatinate and the Halbab.
Yet nothing has come out of this terrarium bouquet.
The plans had barely been made public that the Hesse Land Government had spoken against any participation by Hellaba in them.
Later on, the other two houses did not join.
The Land Bank of Rhineland Palatinate was connected to the Bank of Bade-Wuttenberg in Stuttgart instead.
But there have always been new deals on the grouping of the Deka-Bank with banks in Länder.
Last but not least, Günther Merl, chairman of the Hellaba Steering Committee, spoke out against any commercial strategy for merging with its bank.
Regardless of this, the feeling seems to spread that the grouping of different public sector institutions is particularly urgent.
Now that the election to the Parliament of the Land of Bavaria has passed, a union of the BayernLB with the Bank of the Land of Bade-Wuttenberg could take place first.
For Helaba, this is not particularly good news.
If the pressure that obliges new mergers should increase, potential partners will gradually escape it.
In the South, she would now be a junior partner, although she had so far been more resistant to the crisis than the banks of Munich and Stuttgart.
Hesse-Thuringe's pool of savings and transfers, which owns 85 percent of Helaba's capital, fired a lock at the beginning of the year on any union with WestLB.
The NordLB would remain rigorous.
Such geo-strategic reflections, however, reflect only one of the facets.
Another aspect raises the question of how the different commercial models of each of these banks can be combined.
In June, Merl stated that the decisive question, namely, through which commercial model the future capacity of the Länder's banks should be ensured, had not so far been resolved by the German pool of savings and transfers.
In the long run, WestLb's sketching could take place, which is obviously not wanted here.
This is also the case in the letter from the Steering Committee in place: in any event, a 'global solution' would be included for the establishment.
How all this will be put in the same basket with the union of certain entities with the Deta-Bank remains to be seen.
The second weekend of the beer festival is also known as the Italian weekend.
For Elena, this is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena accompanies him as a girlfriend, and so nothing is the same, he says.
Behind them, close to a five-liter barrel of beer from the Kaiser brand, there is a well-built beard that shows to about 200 visitors of the beer festival what deep sounds its delight can produce.
Elena taps Luca first, then kisses her.
From Bologna, they came to Verona.
From there, from the bus station near Puorta Novo, four buses take departure this evening at 23h45, `destination Monaco, festival della beerra', arriving at 6h30.
Three buses are reserved primarily for Italians, on one of the buses travelling exclusively Brazilians.
In a corner of the parking lot, South American bears and already beside their flag, they already celebrated last night.
And also loud, says Marco Guarda, it's not for the Italians.
The buses belong to Marco, which wears a long double coat of false fur and bezels with large silver mounts.
For five years, they've been going to the beer party, already three turns nothing this year.
They go out at night, stay the day at the party, and come home at 10:30.
Spending the night would involve unnecessary expenses, explains Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome pot with a Kaiser beer, embraced in accordance with the Bavarian Purity Law, health insurance and a German-speaking group manager - Marco took a language course in Frankfurt.
And already the buses ride in the night on the Highway direction `Brennero'.
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly, everything gets calm in the bus, travelers sleep.
That's better, they'll still need their strength.
Breaks will take place in Bressanone, and Holzkirch, while a large number of other buses with Italian registration plates make one more break just before Munich, on Highway 8.
When in the early morning, Marco's group finally arrives at six thirty hours as planned on the parking lot near Thérèse Square, almost 50 other buses from all over Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others gather together, Marco holds a final speech, explains the attack plan.
First: hairy with the little yellow cap.
From this is written on the left `Beer Party' in Gothic, and next to the internet address of the travel agency of Marco `knowscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: `When the doors of the beer hat open, we run', shouts Marco in the early morning.
Run! Run and book the seats at the bottom of the tent.
'Not before, otherwise you block, and not all the yellow caps on the same benches, you must divide them into the room!'
The chop, calls Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget the record!
`Show the security officers that we behave well!
As soon as you leave your seats, they are gone!'
Third: `Tonight, be back here ten and a half hours ago!' Understand?
And that's it, it went to the beer party.
On the way, someone has yellow caps on the trees to find the way, the panels and even an electoral poster of a large popular Bavarian party.
We want to be ready for the return.
It is the second weekend of the beer festival, known as the 'weekend of the Italians'.
There are no specific figures; there are about 50,000 who are going through the Alps and collapsed in the beer kiosk, 10 per cent of visitors would have come from Italy this weekend.
The municipal police are reinforced by seven Southern Tirol police officers, by Italian volunteers who support the Bavarian red cross that carries out statistics on the countries where Italians occupy the first place in front of the British (60 interventions) and Austrians (about 80) with nearly 200 medical interventions.
The one that is particularly appreciated by the Italians is the tent of the Hofbräu brewery.
Insomnia Nights for Hipo Real Estate Shareholders
The German banking system was relatively stable, the Federal Minister of Finance insisted only a few weeks ago.
What a chance the politician used the word 'relatively' and that he slipped that the German banking sector would not be spared by the crisis movements.
This has indeed happened this weekend.
The financial of Bavarian real estate Hypo Real Estate (HRE), next to the DAX, obtains from a consortium of German banks a credit of one billion to protect itself from market turbulence.
One person in the confidence of the situation told Reuters on Monday that aid appropriations are issued up to EUR 35 billion.
The Hypo Real Estate should now pay interest on the fraction to which it would be entitled.
Money comes from both private banks and public law banks.
In the background, Depfa's daughter-in-law supports losses.
The state finance had, according to a newspaper article, been refinanced in the very short term for long-term projects for which it had borrowed money - which has been no longer possible since mistrust of markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's liquidity reserve had been reduced from 95 per cent to 2.37 million euros, the own capital rate had also slightly decreased from 1.6 to 1.45 per cent.
Current and net profits from financial transactions were, compared to the same period of the previous year, down to zero, the profits from the allocation of specified receivables and securities and the termination of provisions in credit transactions had fallen from more than 70 per cent to 5 million euros.
And it is only because of the significant benefits derived from the reimbursement of downstream accounting costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa group, as well as from the repayment of interest according to the book of tax procedures and commercial purchases for Konzern's companies that the deficit in gains of approximately 16 percent has been moderated.
After its privatisation in 1990, the former state finance had first been badly speculated on industrial real estate credits, which had then been affiliated with the Aareal Bank.
Because conventional state funding was not cost-effective enough, Depfa then engaged more intensively in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint projects between private and state investors (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and internationally diversified.
On the value of the daughter-society, the Hypo Real Estate must carry out depreciations that should have on the calculation of the gains and losses of the group an essential material effect which remains still quite vague.
The fact is the dividends have been amputated.
Already for 2007, they had been truncated to two thirds.
The Hippo Real Estate has been, since the purchase of the Depfa, a highly important investor of state and infrastructure.
It is stronger than other institutions dependent on refinancing in the interbank market since it does not have any customer deposits.
With the bankruptcy of the Lehman Brothers investment bank two weeks ago, the allocation of credits between banks again considerably tari, the banks having accumulated their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs a part of the entire Depfa loan for a short-term refinancing facility - approximately EUR 50 billion - annually.
According to a statement by the Hippo Real Estate, the need for the group's funding is covered by the medium-term credit and the company protected from the influence of international financial markets largely out of the way at present.
Other sources say that refinancing will be secured through the funds until the end of 2009.
The Chairman of the HRE Steering Committee Georg Funke explained, however, that the Hypo Real Estate Group should no longer have to use medium-term financial markets.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Establishment for Financial Services Surveillance (Bafin) are based on the principle that the ability of the Hipo Real Group on the market is now assured.
The shareholders and creditors of the bank only have to hope for it.
However, in view of the dynamics and the impermissibility of the crisis, there is no certainty.
It is not unthinkable that funding should not be used in all its scope.
But the opposite cannot be ruled out either.
After the fact that the bank is, according to the latest announcements, still at the doors of insolvency on Sunday at the end of the evening, this rescue for the least provisional will not succeed in restoring the spirits either.
The course of the action fell from 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
On the other hand, the courses of obligations are particularly good.
While first-principal debts have barely moved, second-rate loans are falling.
The most affected are the investment funds of the former Württemberg Hypo daughter and, of course, those that have a lifetime beyond 2009.
The obligations of the bank Hippo Real Estate had previously appeared to be an alternative speculation investment, and now their value must be regarded as dependent on the stability of the international banking system after the net hardening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institution itself which brought the crisis into the establishment by the purchase of the bank Depfa.
While emission institutes, governments and less affected commercial banks are still ready to support the system, it can be assumed that delays can be resorptive in time.
Or what no one dares to hope for at this time - that the financial crisis can be overcome in the next 15 months.
But in the face of renewed sounds of partial nationalization, the probability that was approaching certainty has now become a simple grounded hope.
This should allow long-term creditors nights of insomnia to decide whether to separate themselves from their commitments.
Short-term investors can always use what they have drawn a mark on in order to defer losses for the next few years on the next capital income tax of the automatically collected stock exchange earners.
Sylvana and the secrets of the box in Bento
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, has to show up for the first day at High School in Tachibana, the girls start to laugh: the German is so "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows this word thanks to the Mangas - in her new trading log, she speaks of Japan.
"The first day of school in Japan.
What was I excited about?
I'm already on my way to school.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and take the train 40 minutes to the High School of Tachibana.
I had to find my own way, fortunately I didn't get lost.
The beginning of the courses does not appear to be set as strictly as we do in Lower Saxony.
Students will appear after each other from eight hours until nine hours less than twenty, a table tower begins with the teacher, the "home room".
But before the course started, it was up to me to introduce myself.
I'm not at all like to talk to people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I had not yet the uniform of the school, I put on an old skirt from my foster mother, as well as a shirt, blue top socks and black leather shoes.
In this outfit therefore, I presented myself in front of the desk, and tried to pronounce everything correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - My name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and my birthday is in a week.
At that time, I was very happy to have started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class all made Masses basses, smells of laughter and signs, and I have constantly heard the word "Kawaii".
I already knew him because of my sleeves.
It belongs to the vocabulary indispensable to the survival of Japanese adolescents and means "funny, chou".
Then I quickly slipped into my shoes.
The girl next to me gave me a big ironic smile, she thought it was an honor that the corresponding one had to sit next to her.
The rest of the time was quite calm, but when the gong resonated, I was assailed in the rules.
Everyone talked to who was better, laughed and asked me a lot of questions - in this case, it's quite difficult to understand English Japanese.
During the break, they all came out of their Bento.
My foster mother had also done this kind of Lunchbox - it's really something other than the miserable German cases.
I had rice with aromatic herbs, small sausages, a cucumber and algae salad, fruit and meat around Tofu.
Most of the time, I have no idea what I'm eating right here in Japan.
Things have a strange look and a completely new taste.
What's for sure is everything's really good.
All right, except maybe the fried salt plums, Brrr!
The Bentos are not just lunches in Japanese schools.
Sometimes a girl offers a boy a Bento she has prepared herself, and then is prepared especially carefully - in the hope of getting a little better acquainted with the boy during the break.
I read it in my sleeves.
I'm curious if I could watch him here too.
"Why Japan in particular?" asked my friends when I told them that I wanted to spend a year at school in Tokyo.
Then I always said:
"Because it fascinates me, what"
In the end, reading sleeves is what I've preferred for years.
And in order to better understand the mangoes and culture there, at one point, I also started learning Japanese.
For me, it was really clear that I had to travel there one day.
Because I also have a weakness for traditions, customs and customs.
And here, they're given a lot of importance.
On the one hand, Japan is the country of the most recent technologies and trends - on the other, it is harsh, disciplined and traditional.
And since everything is so well organized, I've never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen."
Rats also have sensations
A rat or a cockroach escapes from danger, does that mean he also feels scared?
The neurophysicist Joseph LeDoux is convinced of this: many animals also have sensations.
But how can we verify that he feels the same way when he behaves in the same way as we do?
In the "Edge" online magazine, contributions have been published for several years by famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series of articles the answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else having so far been able to prove it all as one cannot prove that other human beings have a conscience.
But in this case, one can at least hope that all human brains present the same configuration.
As soon as we turn to other species and address the questions of feeling or in general consciousness, we enter into hard-to-do terrains because the Hardware does not match.
When a rat is in the face of danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: it makes death, escapes or attacks.
Human beings behave in the same way, which is why some scientists deduce a comparable subjective life.
But I don't believe it.
Two aspects of the brain structure make the transposition of our life subjective to that of difficult animals.
One aspect is that circuits almost always associated with human consciousness include the Prefrontal Side Cortex (because of its participation in short-term memory and leadership and enforcement functions).
This vast region is much more developed in humans than in other primates and seems to be entirely absent in other beings.
At the very least for these aspects of our conscience that depend on the prefrontal Cortex, among which the consciousness of who we are, and the ability to predict and decide, it is reasonable to assume that the human being differs even from the other primates.
Another significant particularity may lie in the linguistic nature of Man: a large part of his existence is related to language, which often means that his consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if the conscience did not depend on language, it would certainly influence it, so that animal consciousness, whatever the way it is produced, would probably differ much from most of our states of consciousness.
That is why it is also difficult to determine what consciousness can look like in other animals.
If this, internal and subjective, is neither measured nor, because of this particular Hardware, analyze based on our own experience, then its observation poses great problems.
Most of my developments refer to the content of the conscious life, but there is another aspect of consciousness that should be more easily scientifically accessible.
Animal consciousness processes could be examined without taking account of their content, and this is exactly what happened in studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially with the example of visualization.
But in this approach followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, we focus more on the nerve correlations of consciousness than on causal mechanisms: both can be identical or not.
Curiously, this approach also highlights the importance of the Prefrontal Cortex in the realization of visualization.
But what happens then to emotions?
I conclude that an emotional system such as fear is activated in a brain aware of its own activity.
What we call "fear" is therefore the state of mind in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its aftermath, like the reactions of the body) captures living memory.
Thus observed, emotions are closely related to cortex regions that characterize primates and especially Man.
Subtle degrees of feeling, associated with our volatile nature, emerge, because we can, with the help of words and grammar, differentiate and categorize states to impose them on others than on ourselves.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that the sensations from primitive activities are born in the regions of the body sensation of the Cortex and the brain trunk, as well as Jaak Pankseep that focuses more on the brain trunk.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it could fully participate in transversal sensations of all kinds.
From a purely theoretical point of view, I can't contradict it, but I think that's obvious.
Pankseep argues that what appears as fear in men and rats is probably also felt as such in both cases: how can we check if rats and men feel the same way when they behave in a similar way?
A cockroache runs away from danger, but if he feels scared?
In my view, similar behaviors are not enough to prove the same experiences.
Of course, nerve comparison helps: rats and men have similar brain stems, while cockroaches do not even have a brain.
But is the brain stem causing sensations?
And even if we could prove this to the Man: how can we prove it in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?) have feelings.
But I wouldn't know how to prove it.
And because their sensations are likely to differ completely from ours (because human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore emotional behavior rather than the emotional sensations of rats.
In all cases, progress is marked by nervousness, as the same can be seen in rats and in humans.
As I don't explore language and consciousness in rats, nor sensations, I don't know if they exist.
We could judge this as short-term, but I prefer to move forward rather than constantly forming against a wall.
I am indeed a pragmatic emotion.
Platini, President of UEFA: a grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik explained that preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government considers UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as evidence of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize, in collaboration with Poland, European championships," wasjunik announced.
"But it's not an amnesty for our country.
The work just started, and there is still much to do in both countries."
In the schedule of the construction or destruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, the two guests run after the deadlines.
The number of stages for the European Championship could possibly be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must work at full speed," said President of the Ukrainian League Grigorij Surkis.
"UEFA has been constantly watching us."
An even more radical measure has been decided in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish Football League PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee after many scandals and replaced by Robert Zawlocki, independent administrator.
The commission met at the request of the Minister of Sports Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There would be "a real danger that the PZPN would not be able to act in the rules," declared Drzewiecki of the Polish press agency PAP.
"We have assured in a letter to the President of UEFA that preparations for the 2012 European Championship would not suffer from them."
Several members of the First Division League were already sentenced to mandatory relegation manipulation in the previous season; in the end, the start of the League was even delayed at the last minute.
Dennis Quaid indignified counter-attack
She wanted to promote a new film, talked about her privacy in an interview - and now has trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan lifted the veil on her ex-adulterine Dennis Quaid.
It foams - and counter-attacks.
A late Rose War for the former couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors are engaged in a wretched battle - to the sight and knowledge of everyone.
Last week, Meg Ryan spoke in an interview for the American newspaper InStyle on the causes of marriage failure: "Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, and it was very painful."
She would have known the extent of deception only after the divorce.
The reason for this striptease of thought lies in Ryan's press relations for his new film "The Women" - it tells the story of an adultery.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his calling of unfaithful husband clearly fell: it would be "Monstrous", he said to "New York Daily News", 54 years old, that "Meg once again spoils the history of our relationship and manipulates it".
It would be even more "regretable", that "the pain and turmoil of divorce for each child be revived in public" for their 16-year-old common son Jack."
While Ryan has lived alone since the divorce, Quaid remarried and will soon become the father of twins.
Thus was his answer to the clap: "In any case, my life continues.
I feel happy to have a wonderful family that works best."
Prices for plane tickets and hotels fall
In the first half of 2008, flights and hotel nights were less expensive than the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would even be reduced to 50 percent.
Flights and hotel nights would have again become advantageous - this is the result of a study by the provider of American Express financial services and travel services.
The company analysed its reservation data in the first half of 2008 and established, after an increase in prices in the first quarter, a sharp decrease in profits in the second quarter.
After prices on the hotel market have increased for years, hotel nights have already reduced in many places.
From January to March, prices increased in 41 of the 48 European cities reviewed by 6.9 per cent on average compared with 2007 in 41 of the 48 European cities examined.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
The trend was mainly clear in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay between 30 and 37 percent less than a year earlier.
The causes of all this would lie for American Express in the low dollar rate that led to a "desirable desire for lower travel of American tourists".
Financial places such as Frankfurt or London would also be more affected by the decline in hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Swedish city, hotel prices are maintained with an increase of 26.3 percent, the record in Europe.
Also in terms of flight prices, the trend was rising in the first quarter:
As a result of the increase in the price of kerosene, passengers in economic class paid an average of 7.1 per cent more than in 2007, long-running flights, which were very fuel consumers, even increased to 29.2 per cent.
From April to June, prices in economic class fell by an average of 12.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter, in business class and first class, however, price variations were much less pronounced.
In Germany prices have fallen even more significantly than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices increased by 11.9 per cent, in the second quarter, by 23.6 per cent.
The German domestic flights were even divided by two according to this study.
The reasons for this fall in prices would on the one hand be declining economic growth, explains the firm.
The demand would give up land in many segments of the air travel market.
On the other hand, there would be an increased pressure on competition from the Open Sky Treaty which liberalises air traffic between the United States and Europe.
Signed by the tense situation is the abolition by airlines of unprofitable routes, as well as the high number of airlines that would have deposited the balance sheet during the first half of 2008 - they were 24 companies only in Europe.
HSV beat Gladbach 1:0
With a simple purpose and methods, the SV Hamburg becomes the first in the ranking.
In Borussia, Luhukay has still not been able to find a functional eleven.
By Kristoffer Klein. Enlarge. Disaster landing for international player Marko Marin.
Gladbach's player will only be late in the game and his shot up failed against the goal framework.
His message was precisely worded, he had come out of his lips in a persuasive way.
He just knew he was right.
"We need this second goal," siffla Hermann Rieger in the hall of the robes of the Hamburg arena.
There wasn't much going on in the dressing rooms, the half-time was over and most of them were fed up instead.
Rieger has been HSV's physiotherapist for nearly three decades, and he enjoys a great reputation as former protagonists.
And that's why his request was received at strategic places.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol acquiesced and lifted the thumb to approve.
Cornelius is the brother of the coach-in-chief of Hamburg Martin Jol.
Where orders seem to have been similar: and that jumps with this second goal!
The practice was missing.
"Everything wasn't very nice to see today," Marcel Jansen later confessed.
Bastian Reinhard would have "sustained also be more relaxed".
This 1:0 (1:0 in mid-time), the Hamburg team owes it to a head hit successful by Mladen Petric (at the 11th minute); and the fact that the very weak Gladbach players could not harm the weak Hamburg players.
"It was a dirty victory," said Marin Jol.
Hamburg's SV will celebrate its 121th birthday on Monday.
Already Saturday afternoon, the supporters celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the provisional ranking tables on the giant screen that indicated their club as the first of the class.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to go back," said Marcell Jansen.
There is no doubt that the intermediate result of the table reflects more the unpredictable character of the First League than the domination of its HSV.
The team with its late-onset arrivals - Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goalkeeper Petric as well as Jansen debaked from the Bayern FC - is indeed slowly formed, but it does not yet shine.
"We need more charm and more dribble," said Jol.
After the failure of the vote
On Wall Street, fear circulates.
The first news of the failure of the rescue plan dropped the Dow Jones temporarily by 700 points.
It was the biggest loss of points in the space of a day of all history.
Later, the Dow Jones got a little caught up.
By 8:30 p.m., the world's largest stock market index cost 10,579 points with a decrease of five percent.
The Nasdaq technology fellowship index was 1548 points with a decrease of more than seven points.
The most losers in the Dow Jones were at that time American Express, which lost almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12 percent.
No title could bring benefits any more.
Bank Goldman Sachs' shares accounted for a decrease of almost ten percent.
Just a few days ago, the great investor Warren Buffet joined the company.
As part of the rescue plan, the means must be mobilized for the purchase of what is called damaged mortgage papers.
However, the amount should not be paid at once, but gradually.
On the other hand, the State should recover options on the actions of the financial company that may be exchanged in relation to the course's evolution in order to reduce its burden on the Public Treasury.
Courses of actions aspired to in the whirlpool in Europe and the United States
The billions of aid for banks in Europe and the United States do not address investors' concerns.
The course of the action of the great German bank Hypo Real Estate collapses and pulls the Dax to the bottom.
The U.S. Dow Jones index collapses despite the rescue of the financial market provided for by the State.
The German index (Dax) has led to a serious deficit in spectacular decreases in the Hypo Real Estate and Commercebank courses.
The share of Bavarian real estate finance has now lost three quarters of its value despite the federal government and private banks' rescue operation, Commercialbank has charged a decrease of more than 20 percent.
The Dax has clearly slipped below the important psychological bar of the 6,000 points and cost 5,839 points with a deficit of 3.7 percent.
Worldwide, stock markets have fallen to their knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened with sensitive losses.
Investors feared that the US Government's US$700 billion heavy rescue plan could not be sufficient to restart financial markets.
The Dow Jones at 10,809,25 points lost in the first hour of opening 334 points or 3.3 percent.
The U.S. House of Representatives intended to vote on the rescue plan, and the Senate vote is expected to follow on October 1.
The other European scholarships also had one direction: in London, the FTSE 100 index had a decrease of 3.2 per cent, the ACC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 per cent.
In Asia, the major Japanese index Nikkei fell to 11,743.61 points after an increase of 1.26 percent.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index ran from 2.1 percent to 18.286.90 points.
In India, the main Sensex index lost 506.43 points or 3.9 percent and closed at 12,595.75 points.
In MDAX, Arcandor's shares fell following the announcement of an increase in capital.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheim has subscribed to the 23 million new shares.
The multinational trade and tourism also indicated that the shares will not be sold to Thomas Cook.
Dark matter influences the flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has left researchers in perplexity: dark matter influences the speed of space probes during what is called gravitational support maneuvers.
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity is not entirely correct.
For almost 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" has been flying in space.
As a result of soon frozen fuel pipelines, cryogenic death threatens her.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has been the cause of disruption among researchers - the anomaly of gravitational support.
Gravitational support is a manoeuvre of space probes, by which they obtain an additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example, the Earth.
Thus, probes can save a lot of fuel.
The American-European research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical tip, just like the Ulysses solar probe.
This is surprising to researchers for years: flying objects do not always behave to 100 percent of the way they are expected according to the venerable laws of gravitation.
Much more, irregularities appear at the speed level.
The probes become unexpectedly faster or slower.
Until now, physicists could not explain this effect.
They baptized him the anomaly of gravitational support.
Some experts feared that the theory of general relativity of Albert Einstein, which describes the attraction force of matter due to the curvature of space, might not be entirely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study always believes hard as iron that Einstein did not cheat and tries to explain the anomaly of gravitational support using what is called the black matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
"Black matter could be responsible for this anomaly, which is also near the Earth," he wrote.
Space researchers have known the existence of black matter only for about ten years.
It apparently emanates from it an attraction force whose effect is observable on other celestial bodies.
On the other hand, it is completely invisible, i.e. it does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to scientists' calculations, black matter would still represent a good fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Tourists abducted in Egypt are free
After ten days at the hands of their captors, the kidnapped tourists in Egypt should be released, as confirmed by the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs.
The Sudanese captors had demanded a ransom of several million euros.
During the shooting before the release, six hostages would have been killed.
In southern Egypt, five Germans were abducted.
The ransom negotiations would already be initiated.
The Germans are constantly in the kidnapper collimator.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are visibly free.
This is what the Egyptian state television, the Arab Al-Arabija television channel and the Italian media have been broadcast in concert.
The Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the bulletins of the Italian television channel Sky TG 24: "Our citizens and other hostages have been released.
We are checking their health," said Frattini.
The five Germans, the five Italians and Romanians as well as their eight Egyptian escorts behave well and are safe, Egyptian national television announced.
The 19 participants in the desert excursion should already be on their way to Cairo.
The circumstances surrounding a shooting before the release of the hostages are still unclear: thus, the kidnappers would have been close to putting an end to the abduction, according to the words of an Egyptian security officer, before the Sudanese army kills six of the kidnappers without shouting the station.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with a ransom," said the agent.
There was nothing left to collect the hostages," when suddenly, "this surprise" happened.
Sudanese soldiers had shot down six of the captors in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt on Sunday, and had arrested two of them.
The hostages had demanded a ransom of EUR 6 million from Germany; the money had to be delivered by the German woman of one of the hostages.
The daily newspaper "El Masri El Jom" declared that, according to a German mediator, the release of hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the article, the captors wanted to release women's hostages after the ransom was paid.
The men had to be held until the captors found a safe way to escape.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to comment on this story.
Abuse of a father-in-law who leads to suicide
A court was informed that years of abuse by his father-in-law led a woman to commit suicide.
Michael Trerise, 57 years old, of Stitians, in the Cornwalls, was imprisoned for six years after admission of eight counts of indecent acts.
Truro's High Court reported that he regularly linked his daughter-in-law, Stéphanie Randle, during his childhood, from 5 to 7 years old.
Trerise wrote in a letter of confession: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court was informed that Ms. Randle, aged 34, committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007.
When she lived in Coventry, Trerise had tied her up and bandaged her before forcing her into sexual activity, while her mother worked in the pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in the Cornwalls.
Her daughter-in-law went to Plymouth.
But the court was informed that Ms. Randle, a volunteer assistant to National Trust, was plagued with abuses that had been inflicted on her twice a week.
Attorney General Ramsey Quaife told the court that friends had told me that Ms. Randle, who was a good surfer and cyclist, had appeared since 2006 "emotionally dead," and "had lost all hope for life."
In April 2007, his real father, Terrance Randle, found him dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
We think she killed herself by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle faced the beautiful father of his daughter who also had written a letter of confession that ended up saying: "I attached him and the bandais regularly".
"I didn't abuse her sexually.
"I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "You are really weird as a fetishist, your victim must certainly have been terrified, especially at the age of 7.
"This disgusting saga ended with the victim's suicide.
And what's even more surprising is that if she hadn't done this, her story would certainly never have ended in court."
He added: "I emphasize in particular, as described by his father and mother, the effects of your crime committed for years on Stéphanie.
"Without these, she would probably be a happy, promising, successful young woman today."
Condemnation for loss of official data.
The Cabinet Department Officer who had forgotten top secret documents, in June on a train, will be convicted by the Official Secrets Act, informed the BBC.
The man of the Ministry of Defence was on the move when he forgot two highly classified documents, on a train to Waterloo.
Documents passed into the BBC's hands before they were delivered to the police.
This is the least serious condemnation of this act, without any criminal intent insinuation.
BBC correspondent Frank Gardner stated that this episode had a lot of Whitehall people.
"They thought this case would remain between the walls of the Ministry of Defence and the Office," he said.
The employee who cannot be appointed is charged with a violation of Section 8.1 of the Act, i.e. the clause dealing with the safeguarding of information.
.The Crown Prosecution Service suggested that the ministerial officer be placed under the supervision of the Metropolitan Police, given the very sensitive nature of his work related to the Associated Committee of Secret Services
The documents he lost contained assessments of Al-Qaeda as well as the resources of the security forces in Iraq.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was then transported from his home to a secret place.
Building companies against invoice B&B.
British construction companies may have to pay an invoice of more than £80 million to cover the rescue of the Bradford & Bingley bank.
The Government provided £14 billion to protect the deposits of the 2.6 million Bradford & Bingleys savers.
The interest of this loan will be paid by all companies that collect money from savers, including 59 building companies.
The Director General of Building Societies Association (BSA), Adrian Coles stated that it is "irritating" to know that companies and their members will have to pay the broken pots...
The £14 billion loan will be refunded when the mortgages of Bradford & Bingleys are released.
But the interest that is going to increase at the same time will be debited every year to the 700 financial companies that collect deposits .
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 companies in the building are included in this list.
It's annoying to see that institutions that have been cautious... now have to pay some of the bills of institutions that were far less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It is stated that each company must pay a proportional amount to the deposits it holds, and that intermediate companies must pay about 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that the interest of the loan will rise to £450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find £81 million to settle the interests of the first year.
Adrian Coles, Director General of the Commercial Committee of Building Corporations, told the BBC that this decision seemed unfair.
It is "irritating" to see that institutions that have acted prudently during the recovery of the real estate market must now pay for far less prudent institutions.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since 1945, the date of the first years.
"We must examine all aspects of this case over the next few weeks, to assess the options to be adopted to prevent building companies and their members from paying this paid invoice," said Mr Cole.
Interest for 2009 covers seven months, from the end of September of this year to the end of March.
In 2010, the interests of the whole year will have to be paid, which could also double.
Since the building companies are non-equity organizations, their members end up paying the invoice either by higher charges or by lower interest rates for savings accounts.
Milk increases to five pence per litre
People in Jersey have to pay more for their milk
Jersey Dairy announced that she was going to increase the wholesale price of her milk, from five penny a litre, from Monday.
This is the second price increase that follows an increase of two pennies in February, and follows a research carried out by a consulting company.
Retailers must decide whether they are going in turn, increase the price to consumers.
. Prior to the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey's milk had been varied for the last time, in 2002.
An ex-Pm from Bangladesh was denied bail
A court in Bangladesh rejected a motion for bail from former PM Sheikh Hasina, which is likely to be arrested on his return to Bangladesh.
His lawyers said that the court refused to grant him his bail because of his examination for extorting a businessman, 50 million Taka ($729.000.00) when she was PM.
This case is one of the many accusations addressed to him.
Khaleda Zia, the usual rival of Sheikh Hasina, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to Bangladesh within a few weeks, but her party, the Awani League, demanded that the country's interim military government give it its full freedom first.
Correspondents stressed that the terms of his release were contradictory because if he was allowed to leave the country for medical reasons, they did not see why he could not remain free upon his return to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers announced that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court rejected Sheikh Hasina's claim that she did not require bail because she had been authorized to go abroad for medical reasons," said counsel Rafiqueul Huq.
"We will appeal against the order of the Supreme Court"
His lawyers argued that she needed this security to return to the country in order to prepare for the elections in December.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return after October 17, said a former leader of the Awami party.
She was detained last year after the military interim government assumed power, but was released in June to take care of herself abroad.
Sheikh Hasina, like Zhaleda Zia, denies the charges they face.
Concerns about the Afghan anti-poly campaign.
In Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children have missed the recent immunization campaign against polio, as a result of Taliban-related violence, said the United Nations.
The United Nations conducted a vaccination campaign in the six provinces last week.
But it claims to be unable to contact children in the dangerous areas of Helmand and Kandahar, located in the south.
A United Nations spokesman said that this had happened despite the Taliban's promises not to attack or obstruct thousands of nurses during vaccinations.
BSkyB loses ITV judicial battle
BSkyB lost its trial following the judgment of the Competition Commission, which would force it to reduce its participation in its rival ITV transmitter.
The Competition Appeals Tribunal ordered BSkyB to reduce its ITV shares from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The Commission stated that, in the past, MskyB's participation had prevented competition and allowed it to unfairly influence ITV.
BSkyB purchased its shares in 2006 following an agreement aimed at preventing NTL, now known as Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Fair Trading Office reported that the purchase by BSkyB of ITV shares raised doubts about the effective independence of ITV, thus encouraging the Competition Commission to investigate
Virgin's boss, Richard Branson, a consumer group and Ofcom regulator were all against this purchase.
BSkyB retorted that forcing it to reduce its share of ITV would not be reasonable and on the contrary it was excessive – especially since BSkyB has just given up its voting rights.
New investigation into the case of U.S. prosecutors.
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a special accuser to verify the issue of the dismissal of nine U.S. prosecutors in 2006.
The whole came from the report of the Inspector General of the Department of Justice, who criticized the actions of certain departmental officers.
The report was critical of White House officers, legislators and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation is based on the thesis of lawyers who claim that their dismissal is due to political causes.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officers interviewed during the investigation lied to the investigators, thereby obstructing justice.
"Serious, unsubstantiated charges of potentially criminal conduct have not been fully confirmed or resolved," said Inspector General Glenn Fine, in his report.
The appointment of a special accuser capable of forcing witnesses to file was one of its most important recommendations.
The dispute began with the elimination in December 2006 of nine U.S. prosecutors formulated by the U.S. Department of Justice.
At the time, the department stated that prosecutors were dismissed for poor benefits.
But then it emerged that the dismissed prosecutors were not more criticized than their other colleagues, which encourages some observers to award these dismissals a political connotation.
Some of the prosecutors were accused of being close to the Republicans of Congress, while others would have refused to investigate allegations of fraudulent voting against the Democrats.
U.S. prosecutors investigate and prosecute the courts for the government.
It is certain that they can be fired at any time, but they cannot be fired for political reasons.
The head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, ended up being involved in this dismissal case, and in the end he resigned.
A number of departmental officers from the Department of Justice also resigned.
The Inspector General's report was very critical of Mr. Gonzales' role in this case, stating that he considered him "the first responsible" for these dismissals, and eventually "abdicate" his role as leader," which was remarkably successful in not getting involved in this case.
Other ministerial officers, including former Bush collaborator Karl Rove, were criticized for failing to cooperate during the investigation.
The epic of Meat Loaf will have to be honored.
The Rock star Meat Loaf, must be honoured at the Q Awards for its epic Bat Out Of Hell song.
The singer, who will receive an Oscar at the London ceremony next week, said he was "honored" to get this recognition.
The nine-minute and fifty-second song was the title of Meat Loaf's 1977 album hit.
The award night is presented by Coldplay, with this year, a restricted selection to four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are songs transcending things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly part of it.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a great voice like Meat Loaf.
It begins with an instrumental section that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was put on the market in the United Kingdom, as a single in 1979, falling into the fifteenth place.
In addition, his album Bat Out of Hell remained nine years in the English rankings, and was sold to more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf- or Marvin Lee Aday, of his real name- has suffered from health problems in recent years, even undergoing an operation to cure his heart beat became irregular, after having collapsed on stage, in 2003.
In 2007, a strong laryngitis forced her to cancel concerts.
Then we found him a cyst in the vocal cords.
A Dark Street in the City, Often Forgotten, and Can Be Soon for Sale.
New York has hundreds of avenues, boulevards, streets and other parallel roads, some famous, others only functional.
And even some veteran taxis as well as long-standing local residents do not know how to get to Extra Place, because they have never heard of it.
The street is located in the East Village and runs north of First Street- not to confuse with Second Street- between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide for 120 long, it looks like a dusty alley rather than an active artery.
No signs indicate the street.
It is virtually impossible to find it on a standard atlas.
However, this street has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the manufacturer of recent luxury buildings on First Street.
He would like to repair Extra Place, and create a more fluid passage to shops and shops, which should open in the new buildings.
Other admirers, including long-standing neighbors, have said to be charmed by this shortcut simply because it remains one of the last and oldest streets of the pulp of houses.
But the Department of Preservation and Real Estate Development of the city that manages the street has no interest in keeping it.
This month, at a meeting of the Committees of Neighborhood Owners, representatives of the city agency and Avalon Bay drafted a proposal authorizing the real estate manufacturer to buy the street.
But the committee prefers the street to remain in the hands of the city, and requested a new proposal to submit next month, said Susan Stetzer, the local manager of Committee No. 3.
"There are only a few spaces left in the city, and we would like the city to retain Extra Place," she said.
"They could propose to restore and manage it, what Avalon could do, but we want to keep it public."
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that she wanted to repair the small street and install seats there, some would also be used by a coffee to which the manufacturer would grant the space.
The proposal for this potential acquisition was made public at this month's meeting.
Michele de Milly, Avalon Bay's spokesman, said that although society wants to exploit the street, it doesn't necessarily mean that it wants to be the owner.
"Avalon Bay's main interest is to re-look this abandoned alley, and make it public," she said, stressing that it was the city to suggest the sale."
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Preservation of Real Estate, confirmed that the city wanted to sell the street, stressing further that the agency's mission was to develop property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place left a slight historical footprint.
Some believe that Extra Place has been named since 1802, when the inheritance of the large farm of Philip Minthorne's many children was divided, leaving aside this small piece of land, which has been abandoned since.
The back entrance of the CBGB, a punk rock monument closed in 2006, reopened at Extra Place; the street is certainly more famous thanks to the cover photo of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia"
"This place was beautiful," said Danny Fields, the Ramones manager, who took the picture in November 1976.
It was full of scrapes, hazelnuts, barrels, posters, leaves and ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers who had already talked about the evolution towards the luxury of the East Village, opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, saying that this humble little property should remain public.
Others have proclaimed Extra Place as a true rare - a virtually identical fragment to the city that should be set in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, who conducts a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (under the title "The Book of Testations: A Lovingly Nostalgic Look at A City in the Extinction Process") tells the history of the City and Extra Place, published in The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a small narrow ass-de-sac, dark day and night, and defined by the doors of a rusty iron warehouse and blinds, full of last week's newspapers flying along the gouts."
With few exceptions, the street is always the same.
A short rat agile at the bottom of the street, near a door that used to lead to CBGB, and has now become the seat of a chic clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls, a bottle of beer of 22 ounces empty, lies next to newspapers that have just been dumped.
Some passers-by said they rarely thought of Extra Place, and suggested its enhancement.
Mr. Field, on his side, said that some underestimated the attractiveness of the street in its current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "have unfolded in dark, wet and disgusting places."
The Bilingual Debate: Immersion in the English Language
In this part of the Education Supervision program, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss candidates' position on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, former student member in California, and former director of the Department of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "not as Good as You Did. Why middle classes must be able to choose their school."
Attracting the favors of Hispanic voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama's proposals on education are an interesting example.
Obama's campaign points out that "African-American and Latino students are less likely to graduate than white students."This is a fact of fact.
In order to combat these differences, Mr. Obama's education program particularly supports, among many other subjects, "bilingual transitional education" for those who learn English.
However, the question for Obama is whether his desire to achieve bilingual education that defends language class education other than English is in addition to his interest in eliminating differences.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles.
The students of this school are largely Hispanic, and low-income.
More than one third of students, made up of many new arrivals, study English.
Among the students at the CM1, 100% passed the 2008 state exam of maths, expert level.
Likewise, almost 93% of students have passed the English-language-arts exam
This incredible success was achieved through another ingredient than that advanced by Mr. Obama.
Sixth Street focuses on analysis, practice, a constant capacity assessment and an exemplary attitude.
In addition, and here's an example that Mr. Obama could copy, says Linda Mikels, who is the chief of Sixth Street, this school has introduced the English language education "full immersion".
The total immersion in English focuses on the almost constant use of English in education.
Miss Mikels, contrary to bilingual education, told me "we had a huge success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico, 12 months later, if you were going without his class, you wouldn't have had a chance to identify him."
"It works, she observes, "it worked for us"
Mr. Obama should not take an example of Sixth Street Prep and replicate it in other schools composed mostly of Hispanic students learning English.
The excellent results achieved by this school speak of themselves; but the policies on education within its party (the Associations for National Education have long supported bilingual education) and its enormous support for bilingual education obscure the prognosis of Mr. Obama's response.
Although it is favourable to the fact that immigrants learn English, Mr. Obama recently considered this issue to be insignificant, when he proclaims that we must all stop arguing about the language of the laws in English.
"On the contrary, he said, "you must make sure your child speaks Spanish."
If Mr. Obama really wants to eliminate the differences, then he should consider carefully the educational models that work, rather than detach them or consider them insignificant.
Net Oil Falls Follow-up to New World Economic Concerns
Oil prices dropped sharply on Monday, as people fear that the rescue plan for financial markets will fail to bring the economy back to life.
The final crude oil operations fell by 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel. The New York Mercantile Exchange, during this morning's sales.
Prices have dropped more than $20 per barrel since last Monday.
Over the past two weeks, the raw materials markets have been shaken by the financial turmoil of Wall Street, as well as by two powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After having experienced an increase of $145.29 per barrel in July, prices fell to almost $90 per barrel this month, before rebounding again in view of the profound uncertainties of financial markets.
This Monday, investors are again concerned despite the agreement on rescue, the largest in history, concluded this weekend by the leaders of Congress.
The news was mitigated by the recent concerns that the crisis would be sustainable.
In the most recent episode of this financial disaster," Citygroup will purchase the Wachovia Corporation banking operations, said the government this Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments partly nationalized the European Financial Conglomerate, Fortis.
Barclays Capital analysts stated that the frenetic negotiations this weekend, concluded with the rescue agreement" seem to have failed to revive the market."
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for raw materials, including oil, should slow down.
"The prospect of global equity, interest rates and market exchange has become uncertain" wrote Deutsche Bank analysts in a letter to their investors."
"we believe that raw materials will not be able to escape this contagion.
"As far as raw materials are concerned, our most pressing concern is to understand the extent to which the American virus would spread globally and in particular in China."
The bank analysts reduced their expectations for next year, given the fall in oil consumption due to the slowdown in economic growth, they were therefore forced to decrease by 20 per cent, the forecast of oil and gas prices for 2009.
The Second Time Celebration Determining for the Improvement of the Team Record.
After having spent the last eight seasons, more time than anyone in the uniform of the Jets Shaun Ellis, the defender thought he had seen everything.
He watched the second time, when the Jets turned a 0 to 0 into an explosion.
"I've never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
The second time began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals played well under dark clouds.
Then the fourth back Brett Favre managed to make a pass at Laveranus Coles allowing a 12-yard touchdown, a precursor sign of one after noon during which their relationship made a leap forward.
Favre found Coles for another two other touchdowns, the first when a corner back fell and the second, 10 seconds from mid-time.
"I didn't get out of my area" Favre said about all his passes to Coles.
"he's a mediocre player"
"We communicate extremely well, despite what people think."
While Favre and Coles played the catch, the defense beat the fourth back of the Cardinals, Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, corner back, intercepted a lost shot and made 32 yards up to the touchdown.
Eric Smith made another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker, David Bowens let the ball escape because of Warner.
At the last change, the loss of Bowens' ball might well be the most charming event.
The Cardinals took control of this possession for the last 10 seconds, and then the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely made a 20 yard goal taking advantage of 34 to 0.
That's the best the Jets could have scored in a while.
"The Jet coach Eric Mangini, who was asked to describe this madness, said "the second time or the third?"
When they told him the two- the Jets let pass 21 undisputed points in the third time- Mangini said: "I can tell you that I appreciated the second time more than the third.
"Many points have been marked in a short time."
Gebrselasia rested, surpasses its world record.
Haile Gebrselassie, Ethiopian, again proved worthy of his title as the best runner of the century, after having beat his own world record at the Berlin marathon Sunday, becoming the first to run 26.2 miles in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a win in 2:03:59 of a comfortable race on the plate, Gebrselasie beat his record of 2:04:26 last year in Berlin by 27 seconds.
At 35 years of age, Gebrselasie won the 26th world record of his superb career during which he won the world championship or the world record for any distance, from the 1600 meters of the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassia had missed the Beijing Olympic Marathon, fearing- it can be exaggerated in the eyes of today,- that air pollution does not increase its asthma problems.
On the contrary, he promised to run to Berlin.
Under almost perfect conditions- sunny time, 48 degrees initially, 55 on arrival- Gebrselasie won Sunday, now an impressive average of one thousand in 4 minutes 43 seconds
The racers such as Gebrselasie and Paul Tergat, both Kenyans, converted into background runners, have contributed to the reduction of the marathon record by more than two minutes in the last ten years, since 1998, when Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin at 2:06:05 .
After Sunday's victory, Gebrselasie told the reporters, had suffered cramps two weeks before, and had missed training for a week.
It is clear that the rest allowed him to remain bright, but not rusty.
"I am so happy," he told the reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I gave it up last week, and today I had doubts; but in the end, everything went for the best."
He has been reproached - especially in Kenya, the rival is African of Ethiopia - for having too much orchestrated his races, avoiding the world stars of the marathon, actually counting on the hares as if they were in a race track, and considering world records more than the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the size of Gebrselasia's capabilities as a bottom runner.
Sunday Gebrselasie, preceded by four Kenyans, recorded a time of 1:02:04. on my way.
Two Kenyan elite riders, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to challenge Gebrselasia after the heads of the line disappeared.
Just over three miles from the arrival, Gebrselasie made his final climb to get off Kwambai, which ended second in 2:05:36, improving his best personal record by five minutes.
Kamathis arrived third in 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, now a German citizen, finished a remarkable year obtaining the seventh time of 2:19:19.
Englishman Paula Radcliffe holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko, surprised everyone winning the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She could not participate in the Beijing games because of a hypothetical wrong back, but promised to win in Berlin, improving her third marathon, her personal record of almost five minutes.
She runs using a skilled strategy, letting the group of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners take a great advantage , then exceeding about 18 thousand 1⁄2 afterwards.
Askale Tafa Margasa from Ethiopia arrived second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kipp, Kenya, ended third in 2:25:01.
In a town in Part, the Orgueil and the trials of the Black Life
Hidden in the development of its immense park, a few miles from the sunny, brilliant and giant Orlando, is a small quiet town where pride and complications of African-American experience arise.
"Eatonville, the first completely black town to integrate, Zora Neale Hurston's childhood home, this description she made in 1935, is no longer so simple to do today."The city in five lakes, three croquet courts, 300 dark skins, 300 good swimmers, full of goyavas, two schools and no prison."
She has now become a city of pilgrimage
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to Zora Festival every year in Eatonville to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous writer of the Renaissance Harlem.
And in various ways, the city she describes- has become tourist thanks to her inclusion in the Florida tourist guide published by The Depression-era Federal Writers' Project- remains a separate place.
She is also independent, dignified, and private that she was not already in the 1930s, when Hurston told that Florida's black rural population was often reluctant to share her true thoughts with the white man, who "we know so little, doesn't know what he loses".
Even though it is the year of the election of a black president, Senator Barack Obama, who has invoked an open dialogue on the subject of race, many here remain cautious of the look on the outside.
"we are very cautious about how to tell the story," said Hortense Jones, 59 years old, who has always been resident and the oldest parish priest in the city.
"It must conform to reality.
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and fighting.
It represents both a historical model of black people taking power and a community of nearly 2400 people where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a central point but also an example of South-South black rural culture - sometimes detached, sometimes acclaimed - which reminds us of the birth of American slavery.
This would explain why residents are both proud and protective.
The interest in Eatonville's image born with Zora, which everybody here calls Hurston.
She presented her hometown worldwide through sincere books full of dialects, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Your Eyes Are Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida guide transformed this city, located just at the exit of Route 17, a road that crosses the centre of Florida, often forgotten, which leads to the chapter of black history and human drama.
Such a bold case in life as in literature, Hurston led readers to the property store of Eatonville's first mayor, Mr. Joe Clarke, who was then divided into several private parts.
"past the road on the left," she writes, "you will find the modern brown and white public school, with its gardens and well-preserved playgrounds, which Howard Miller has always taken care of, although he barely knows how to read and write.
She also mentioned the new husband of Widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn" sells drinks of all kinds as well as anything that can be used for passing people.
So, in just a hundred words, Hurston associates Eatonville with a self-government but also with illiteracy, remarriage, and sex.
Of course, Fodor wasn't like that.
It wasn't actually a portrait that everyone liked.
Zora well described the reality " declared Ella Dinkins, 90 years old, one of Johnson's girls who had immortalized, quoting the colourless songs, interpreted by men who praised their beauty."
She added: "some people didn't like it."
We always remember Hurston as a living and eccentric person, who returned frequently after his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that Hurston usually arrived in town without warning, on board a large Chevrolet, a cigarette in his mouth and wore pants here, where even today, we are proud of traditional clothes.
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin said, while many mocked her.
"people were always happy to see Zora," he said.
But he also adds, swinging in his back patio chair that gives on Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was certainly baptized, that "it never remained too long".
At Hurston's death in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of production.
Eatonville and the whole world seemed to have forgotten him.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at the 20's Barnard College was buried in any grave, in Fort Pierce, Fla, where she lived.
In Eatonville, no great commemoration, no plaque for the general public.
I don't think they understood the contribution or legacy it offered to the world " declared Valérie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography of Hurston published in 2003.
A crucial moment occurred in the 1980s.
Public officials in Orange County wanted to take a five-way highway into town to replace Boulevard Kennedy, a two-way main street in the community.
Orlando's development has already pushed Interstate 4 to the west corner of the city.
The proposal was made while Eatonville was just remixing a difficult period of its history.
Forced integration, among many other things, has put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the conflict over the mix of races led to hatred at the gates of the community.
"At that time, a band of young white people came to launch oranges or objects against people sitting on the side," said Mr. Franklin.
"a lady has even died."
They launched a watermelon from their car."
In a letter from 1955 addressed to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's request for forced integration, defining its decision in Brown v. Board of Education" insulting rather than glamorous of my race."
Residents now proclaim that the elimination of racial segregation in schools, although positive in some respects, has diluted Eatonville's cohesion and weakened the confidence of young people.
"The black children used to be kissed--I remember well--we embraced our master in the morning, and also in the evening," said N.Y. Nathiri, Ella Dinkins' daughter, as well as Chief Director of the Rescue of the Eatonville Community, a non-profit group.
This lasted, she added, until the time when teachers and students were no longer from the same place.
"You don't kiss your white teacher because he's white--I mean there's a cultural demarcation line here," said Ms. Nathiri.
Civil rights, moreover, have created space for many other Zora Neale Hurston- black writers, actors and artists who have gone beyond harm, such as her, armed with a joyful own trust and lines of conduct such as: "how can they deprive themselves of the pleasure of my company?"
That's beyond me."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker visited the anonymous tomb of Hurston and began to fight to revive his reputation.
Five years later, a biography acclaimed by Robert E. Hemenway, a true best seller, reintroduced it to the American cannons.
The motorway project came just as Eatonville's most famous girl had found her attraction.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors consider her a lifesaver.
The community began to organize a Hurston festival to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences this highway would have.
Hundreds of fans came to the opening of the festival two years later, and many return in January to commemorate it.
After many years, the contents rejected the motorway proposal.
"The five-way highway fiasco, extremely fast, is a real civic pride," said Ms. Nathiri.
Ms. Boyd summarized the whole statement that "Zora saved Eatonville".
The victory against the motorway project allowed him to change his own image.
Non-residents, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been attending our church since 1993, began to come in large numbers, and residents began to reconsider the past.
Eatonville has been classified as a historic city since 1998.
A mono theme library (referred to as Hurston) opened in 2006 on a magnificent Kennedy Boulevard, renovated.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly for Florida: at six miles from Orlando, it can at any time be considered as a back street after a day of summer rain, small as it was when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
(Today there are 90 percent blacks)
Foreigners who come to discover Eatonville's story, his reason for being, are still cautiously treated.
We must ask permission for most interviews, and certain things - like the walls of the old Eatonville church, painted by white man, illustrating black men in the fields - should not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Miss Jones, a courageous teacher who has a weak for living red, are always afraid that their island community will be well understood.
However, given the expansion of the Hurston festival, a certain level of local pride has emerged.
Young people in particular tend to regard Eatonville as Hurton considered its entire race: beautiful, problematic and everything, not better or worse, but as proud, creative, bossy, mad and mixed as other ethnic and racial groups in America.
It is much of the heartfelt civic affection that is heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew Edwin Harvey, 18, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work for the local government or police forces, who need additional strength.
And even for younger people, such as 11-year-old Alondra and Alexia Kenon, winter Park twins, seem to have learned the Eatonville description correctly.
"Most people who pass in this area will think: "Oh, this city has nothing compared to others" Alondra Kenon said after last Sunday.
But if you stop and take the time to contemplate history, it is a very beautiful city."
Here in New York, everyone speaks frequently about finance.
In spite of everything, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan were staying away from the kiosk and giant TV screens at Times Square, they would not realize that they are in the eye of the cyclone.
They could never think only in the glass and bee nest offices above their heads, bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York, spend the worst "day of work in the office" since the 1929 crack.
Suppliers continue to fumble on the sidewalks, with their wagons and muffins for morning meetings.
Latino still hangs between residential buildings carrying, like mules, about 50 luxurious shirts hanging on a yoke arranged on his shoulders.
Office employees continue to line up to buy their morning sandwiches to street vendors, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m. a week.
I had not felt the crisis despite the completely pessimistic stories until this afternoon when I decided to open a new savings account.
Fortunately, I planned to work late at noon, because I found out at my local branch of JP Morgan Chase, about twenty people doing the tail.
Not in front of the cashiers' window, not to remove the species or make a payment, but in front of the customer service window, where regular customers ordered their cheques, tourists asked for management for the Macy store, and new customers opened accounts.
Most of those in front of me, I would later learn about Starr, my "authorized personal banker," were all tailed for the same reason as me.
Not in the same way, because they had already taken their savings from smaller banks, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They withdrew their money from savings accounts called trifts (such as a building company), credit associations, and the type of local savings banks and their subsidiaries that operate only in one state, and who claim to treat customers as their family.
In a recent past, 15 of these banks failed.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank in the capital of $327, has used the bankruptcy union, and while the New Yorkers were returning home for the weekend on Friday evening, another bank, Wachovia, on account of a value of $440 million, desperately sought a buyer to save it.
The office and the store employees who are in front of me, scared of another potential debacle, have transferred their money to a bank that they think is reliable, the one that makes the most of saving on Wall Street.
Some New Yorkers have become very familiar in the world of finance in recent weeks.
"I heard a lady at my local Chinese supermarket, talking on the phone of Lehman Brothers, the bank that failed, and his skinny CEO Dick Field, with the same familiarity she could have to criticize a colleague.
And Lyn, the concierge in the uniform of my building, changed the subject of our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or the deliveries of my fruit and vegetables merchant.
She told me, following my visit to the bank, "I put all my savings in the money market.
"I've changed, I don't want to take risks."
Desecrated Muslim Tombs while Austria oscillates to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, who abandoned the right wing of the Austrian Freedom Party party and , Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right Vlaams Belang, took part in a demonstration to present the organization of the " cities against Islamization" in Antwerp, Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They wear road signs depicting red striped mosques.
Police accuse extreme right extremists of desecrating an Austrian Muslim cemetery, the weekend of the victory of extreme political parties Right to the country's general elections.
More than 90 graves were seriously damaged at Traun Cemetery near Linz between Friday night and this morning, according to the police, organized action.
Offenders painted several graves, Jewish symbols such as the Star of David; however, detectives believe that this could have been done to disguise the sentiments of extremists against Muslim immigrants.
Could this accident be somehow linked to the elections.
A spokesman of the local Islamic community declared himself "deeply shocked" to announce this desecration, which occurs just during the religious month of Ramadan that comes to an end.
Austria is seriously thinking of regaining its courage, as a result of its oscillation to the right during yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two extreme right-wing parties, which had nearly 30 percent of the votes, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, conducted an anti-immigration campaign. Some of their slogans were even considered, according to critics, to be xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the votes, carried out his campaign against the port of scarf and burkas, and even expressed his opposition to alaha food.
During his final race in Vienna, he spoke of "a European fraternity" to avoid the rise of Islam.
Both parties are trying to prevent the construction of mosques and minarets, claiming that they would constitute a political symbol of the Islamization of Austria and Europe.
The polls and analyses carried out immediately after the elections defined the extreme right as the country's strongest political bloc, which is demonstrated by the majority of young voters who made the difference, as they were worried about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter is prohibited from travelling abroad.
The courts prohibited rock star glamour, Gary Glitter, accused of child abuse, expatriation in France and Spain.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter, after he expressed to the authorities under his control, his intention to travel to Spain through France.
The Police in Kent had given this ban to travel last Thursday after having proven to the magistrates the guilt of Glitter for child sexual abuse.
Glitter, or his real name, Paul Gadd, was not present at the court hearing in Ashford, but was still represented by his lawyer Corker Binning.
A court spokesman declared "Thursday, September 25 in Ashford's court, Kent's police requested an application to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from travelling to France and Spain until March 25.
"Paul Gadd wasn't there then."
Glitter, 64, informed the authorities that he wanted to go abroad, left to be registered in the sexual abuse lists.
It must inform the authorities if it wishes to go abroad for more than three days.
It must also inform the police, 7 days before its scheduled date of departure.
If he does not communicate his movements to the authorities, he could serve up to five years of imprisonment.
Kent's police stated that it would not discuss any particular cases or potential movements of Glitter in the contents.
A spokesman for the Kent Police said, "Kent's police will do everything they can to protect our children as well as those from abroad.
"We think it is easier to monitor someone who remains in the United Kingdom because we have devices capable of managing any potential risks, in a much more effective way.
"Protection of the people of Kent is the most expensive intention of the Kent Police, and we closely monitor the behaviour of those accused of sexual abuse in the region, in order to minimize potential risks to the public."
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month, having served 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two girls aged 10 and 11 respectively.
When he was released, Glitter took the plane to Bangkok from where he should have boarded for a flight to London.
But he said he wasn't feeling well, and refused to leave for London.
The Thai authorities blocked him into passport control, and in the end he left for Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities refused him entry into their territory, and therefore he was forced to go to Bangkok; the Thai police and immigration officers insisted that he return to England.
He finally arrived at Terminal 3 of Heathrow airport on 22 August and stayed there while his lawyer, David Corker, went to the court of limited jurisdiction of Uxbridge, West London, for registration on the list of persons accused of sexual abuse, as required by Scotland Yard.
In the past, Glitter had already been sentenced to four months in the United Kingdom, for holding images of child abuse.
A source from the Ministry of the Interior stated that Jacqui Smith, the Minister of the Interior, was reassured and happy to know that Glitter had been prohibited from travelling in France and Spain.
"I photograph the master out of the scene to capture elements of his character" Günther Bauer - Photographer
No heels, no foreign clothes.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, freed from all tensions to obtain the relaxed aspect of man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Inseparable except in the privacy, in these unknown moments of the general public, where we discover with intimate gestures and stolen eyes of artists who do not care to ride on stage.
German Günther Bauer mixes in "Flamenco - people" the theatricality of some plays with singers, dancers and guitarists with this less known side of artists.
In this project, the photographer resumes the particular iconography of flamenco from different angles.
Included in the programming of the Flemish Photography Month, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, greater every day," explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco - people" "may be anyone but, after seeing the photos, the observer realizes that these are not typical images of artists on stage.
These people photographed "in the street" are artists capable of transmitting on the scene of passion, sadness, joy ... by captivating the public.
To capture moments of personality of these artists you don't need to take pictures on stage.
They have a clean personality and character.
What interested me was to create an intimate atmosphere that allows me to capture with the camera the moments of personality of the flamenco stars."
With the festival "Cant populaire des Mines", Bauer began a long journey in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a flat camera.
These are portraits that, thanks to the choice of the camera and the equipment, recall classical photography.
The implementation of different stylistic means breaks with the classic side of the image, giving it a touch of modernity, this reflects the perception of flamenco according to Bauer: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and surprises every day".
It is not about dancing or singing in itself, but about the personality and character of the artist who captures the audience with his art.
The search for the essentials and magic has been the constant of this work presented these days at the gallery El Fotómata.
The flamenco stars such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are part of the selection made from about seventy photographers.
The project has become an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a collection book of portraits exposed to the gallery.
The passion for Bauer's portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with the "Portraits of Old Sports" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco - people", the photographer admits that he loves to photograph the portrait of people, to know them and to be able to enter their lives for a moment more or less.
I think in photography the portrait is the most difficult kind.
You find yourself in front of people, characters that sometimes you don't know or that just give you a few minutes to get a picture of them.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true."
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco called "Flamenco - people", is exhibited at the Galerie El Fotómata, located at the 20th Street of Mata (tree parallel to the Peopleaie d'Hercule) which will be opened until 16 October next.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is "true daring"
The novel takes place in places that nobody knows and deals with unknown subjects, but once again, Mario Vargas Llosa is determined to advance the new project on which he works, a novel that has as main character Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who has lived in Congo for twenty years and who has passed through Amazonia.
The Nobel Prize Prize for Literature yesterday confessed to the Hay Festival Segovia, that the novel currently occupying it "is a real daring" and that "everything proves that it should not write it".
"If I was reasonable, I wouldn't do it, but I will do it and hope to finish it," he concluded in his speech at the festival of exchange of ideas and thoughts that for four days he saw parade in the city of the aqueduct about a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "The City and Dogs" was the most expected character of the third edition of this festival and completed his contract.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award by the majority of the participants, made the hall full at the Juan Bravo theatre.
The presenter of the Festival, Felix Romeo, found himself confronted with a fascinated audience who did not see the past hour during which the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with a large dose of humor, traced the birth of his literary vocation, which is due to "sa thirst to read" and "to live new experiences"; how he wrote of a "very methodical manner" thanks to intense work of documentation, correcting and rewriting part of the text to face his "lack of inspiration"; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas influenced his vocation and how his memories inspire his novels.
The Hispanic-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if books change life. "But I refuse to believe that literature is a pure fun, an ephemeral experience," said Vargas Llosa, who said that it "has effects" and "makes people less similar", because writers were asked "not to let themselves go to frivolity" and to assume their vocation.
Bad weather spoils Pozoblanco's fair
The banner party that concluded the bull races at the Pozoblanco fair was suspended yesterday morning, after the horse bullfighters verified that the arena was impracticable.
In this way, the organizing committee, in agreement with Fermín Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Léonard Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the bull race.
The bad weather hit this fair, since finally two out of three parties couldn't take place.
Saturday it was rain that prevented the celebration of the second scheduled bull race.
At the poster there was José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz y Juan Bautista, who should have faced in the arena of Castilblanco
So only the Friday party took place
On Friday, the winner was Daniel Luque who cut three ears and was brought into triumph, after making arm movements in front of the bull with taste and aesthetics.
In the afternoon even Alejandro Talavante concluded on two banners planted on the back of the bull and a cut ear that the discovered gardens applauded more than his own struggle with the bull.
Worse still for El Juli, who entered the arenas of Los Llanos without pain or glory.
In his fight with the second bull, after a much better fight, he got whistled by most of the public.
Police control of a van in the province of Alava: two thousand kilos of hachisch found
Five hours minus ten in the morning.
Traffic control of the Basque police (Ertzaintza) at the border of the Municipality of Armiñón (Alava).
Police officers arrest two occupants of a van and the latter two undertake the escape.
Its loading, more than two tons of hasch, what to stop them from.
Police officers prosecuted them and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old man identified as A.A. J., according to information disclosed by the Department of the Interior of the Basque Government.
The arrested individual was accused of drug trafficking and document falsification.
The incident occurred when several officials of the Alava Traffic Unit carried out vehicle control on the N-1 border of the Municipality of Armiñón.
They were about to stop a van to inspect it when the driver disobeyed orders, suddenly accelerated and control started.
The police began pursuit until the vehicle stopped two kilometres further down the coast, where the two occupants descended to escape in a wooded area.
The Basque police finally arrested one of the two occupants and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they carried and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The rear of the vehicle was loaded with achisch bullets and then moved to a police station for a thorough inspection and weighing the drug.
In addition, officials found that the registration plate had been "facsimile" since it did not coincide with the one written on the grey card of the van, that is also why they charged the prisoner with a crime of falsification of documents.
Ertzaintza continues its investigation to arrest the other suspect, who managed to flee and determine the origin of the seized drug.
The 28-year-old A.A. J. was alerted to the various steps and will be judged within the next hours.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the influence of a drug
Actress Heather Locklear, the famous Amanda of the Melrose Place TV series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Bárbara, California for driving under a drug.
A witness saw him do strange maneuvers trying to get out of his garage in Montecito, according to what a spokesperson of the California police patrol revealed to People magazine.
The witness pointed out that around 4.30 p.m., Locklear "was fully supporting the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the garage, and going back several times, it rolled over its sunglasses."
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who initially had not recognized the actress, saw that Locklear stopped in the middle of the highway and got out of her vehicle.
This person, at that time, called emergency services because "she was worried about Locklear's life".
When the police patrol arrived, she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which partially blocked the road.
"She looked disoriented," which is why the agents took her to the drug and alcohol centre to perform a test.
According to a police spokesperson, the actress was cooperative and alcohol abuse was dismissed from the outset, although "according to the observation of police officers at first sight, we thought Locklear was under the influence of a drug".
Locklear was arrested being suspected of having driven under the effect of a substance that was not specified and was incarcerated about 7 p.m. and released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left the Arizona clinic where she was hospitalized to treat with nervous depression.
Lalamazares asked the Andalusian Federation of the United Left to assume its responsibilities in the Silva case
The coordinator general and deputy of the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, stated today that it was the regional federation who made a decision on the case of former Youth and Sports Councillor of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of performing favourable treatment to his family members.
"In these cases, I am very federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that will have to assume its responsibilities," said Lalamazares as regards the behaviour of the political party that he will have to adopt within the municipal council of Seville.
However, the leader of the United Left requested that investigations show "transparency" for the irregularities that Silva could have committed: "The United Left has always defended such cases so that they have a maximum degree of transparency".
He also stressed that the political party has "very strict ethical codes for all civil servants".
"Mayo's Blood," Garci's ossuary
Drawing from the stories of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recreates the famous battle of the Spaniards against the French in "May Blood", which is the most ambitious film of his filmography with nearly 15 million euros of budget.
The filmmaker tried "to stage the many characters and illustrate the social analysis" that he always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of the long list of actors.
The film lasting more than two and a half hours, "May Blood" will be released in the cinemas next Friday, which will then become a television series for Telemadrid for more than four hours.
Grand admirer of Galdós literature, José Luis Garci makes sure that he realized with this film "a child's dream" thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago to turn a memorial film for the two hundred years of May 2, Madrid, which he always accepted when the story was held to national historical facts.
The 15 million euros provided by the City of Madrid constitute a "one opportunity" for Garci to reproduce with the appropriate decorations and clothing the atmosphere of "a Spain that has deceived itself as leader for the fight, since the struggle for independence has led the people to rebellions under the reign of Ferdinand VII", he said.
But the filmmaker regrets that he did not get funding as for the films "Captain Alatriste" or "The Ghosts of Goya" - more than double that obtained for "May Blood",- because he was unable to turn some scenes written in a script signed by Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he collaborated during almost his entire career.
The filmmaker of "Rear has started" influenced his usual way of working, on the stage of actors, with whom he usually repeats before starting the shooting and to whom he does not cast, since it seems "humble" to him and considers that "the role of the filmmaker is to go to the theatre and to the cinema to keep himself informed".
Many actors in "Blood of May" repeat in front of the camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larragañaga or Fernando Guilllen Cuervo.
Four times the Oscar candidate (he won one), Garci considers that the three candidate films that represent Spain this year at the Academy of Hollywood, "May Blood", "Seven tables of French billiard" and finally the winner, "The blind sunflowers", are not representative of the young Spanish cinema, "which would deserve to be better known," he said.
With this film Garci doesn't expect a price.
"In the beginning you think you're working for posterity, and then you realize that you're working for prosperity, and now you're happy to make an extra movie," says Garci after more than 30 years of career.
Isabelle Bayón puts herself in the skin of the Sevilla dancer Tortola Valencia
A Sevillan dancer will pay tribute to an equally Sevillan dancer.
Carmen Tortola Valencia, daughter of a Catalan father (Florenç Tortola Ferrer) and a Andalusian mother (Georina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the district of Triana and who at the age of three will live in London with her family.
She was a free dance dancer and a specialist in Eastern dances.
She had an exciting life, a pioneer in the liberation of the woman, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was Buddhist and vegetarian and pleaded for the abolition of corset that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman, who marked the history of dance in Europe between the two wars, fascinated Isabelle Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and the latter offered me to interpret the Sevilla dancer Tortola Valencia and it seemed incredible to me."
According to the dancer, "we're not trying to tell her life but to translate her way of thinking.
His dance titles made me think of flamenco.
Thus, "the butterfly dance" made me think of a Cuban popular dance and "the snake dance" to some tangos.
His dance was sensual and they told me that my way of dancing was the same as his," she said.
The stage was made thanks to two remarkable contributions: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing again Isabela in one of his shows, as he had done at "The Open Door"; and that of Professor Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to collaborate with the one who was his student.
"Matilde turns Tortola into a mature character.
I am happy that she has agreed to play a role in my work and it honors me."
The stage was also made thanks to the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres y Paco Arriaga, the popular song of Michel Ortega, el Pulga y Moi de Morón; the percussions of El Pájaro, as well as the rape of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "who plays the role of the eternal companion of these kinds of artists who were considered divas".
This work also tells, in a way, the life of this woman who has exhibited herself in places so far away, especially for the time being, such as India, the United States, or Russia, but also throughout Europe, since she usually lived in London.
"I wanted to remind her because I think it's these women who have a huge influence in their time and now nobody knows and doesn't value her work," Bayón says.
The show will begin at 8:30 p.m. at the theater Lope de Vega
The publication of the "Newly Married Poet's Journal" concludes the Triennat
The presentation of the first edition of the "Newly Married Poet's Journal" in the Church of Saint Stephen's in New York, where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia to celebrate the "Trinnat Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the Nobel Prize for Literature and their deaths.
In this way, the "Triennat Zenobia and Juan Ramón" comes to an end with the reissue of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and with the travelling exhibition " Juan Ramón Jiménez: This poplar of light" which was inaugurated last May and which, after traveling in the various Andalusian provinces, will go to New York at the International Congress.
Similarly, the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia purchased eight hundred copies of the "Newly Married Poet's Journal", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to perpetuate the work of one of the most famous Andalusian poets.
America likes less without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people
Paul Newman was part of it."
This phrase is by actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "absence of malice", and illustrates the despair of American cinema, and all America, in the face of the shocking idea that Newman is no longer of this world.
He had a hard time getting an Oscar.
He hasn't been back since 2007.
Everyone knew he was sick.
That was a tough blow for everyone.
"Sometimes what one feels exceeds all expression, and now I have lost a great friend," cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better because of its existence."
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
One of the fathers of cinema and homeland died during a particularly dark period, where terrorists and stock markets are afraid, the esteem of Americans has fallen very low, desperately seeking the reasons for dignity.
When times are so hard and without reason to live, it remains to human beings only admiration and it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
He embodied for everyone an ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the enemy of Richard Nixon and the defender of lost and defeated causes, such as the foundation for the fight against drugs created in honour of his deceased elder following an overdose and the creation of his own bio-food brand.
It was a victory for a country that had a hard time imposing itself on a suicidal food culture.
This huge wave of admiration swept Hollywood without paying attention to nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, English Daniel Craig, found that no James Bond died before him.
Another Englishman, Oscar Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman marked the top of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to name Newman as his greatest inspiration.
"He put us the high bar," said George Clooney, who is perhaps the only one today who is trying to penetrate the screen as Paul Newman did: being very honest and having a serious private life and far from goals.
It's still not easy or possible in the media jungle today.
But there is the one who tries, and Paul Newman is an example.
After a divorce, he was married 50 years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he was faithful even though opportunities were not lacking to be.
"But why should I eat a hamburger out of my house, if I have a steak in my fridge?" he used to play.
In heaven, he proudly attends the meeting of his daughters with his fans on earth, something that is not so usual in America.
"Of all the great roles he has played, he has never been as proud as that of the devoted husband, the loving father, the caring grandfather and philanthropic," he says.
Madrid in the 2016 Olympics event
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid can organize Olympic Games, after the failure in 2012, this could happen in 2016.
But I wonder if we're ready.
If we take the example of yesterday's race: we are not!
They call it the perfect race, but I think it was the worst race I've ever been in.
If they had taken into account all the errors that had occurred during the race, they would have been the subject of an elimination note.
But let us examine everything in detail and from the very beginning.
Mistakes begin with the removal of the files, which forces you to go ahead.
It's not bad, but if they make you move, it'd be better if they gave you everything (including the electronic chip for the races).
Well, no.
They made you go there only to take the file (first mistake, move only for this) and (after a long line of waiting) surprise!, there was only the size 'S' for the jersey (second mistake, because I need an XL size)
What world do we live in?
Is it because of the crisis they decided to buy that small shirts with less fabric and less expensive?
Well, this isn't about what happened on the day of the races.
Apart from the fact that we have to go there very early to remove the electronic chip, the waiting line is 15 minutes and, moreover, we have to leave the bag behind at the entrance.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, this is incomprehensible since 11,000 people are expected for these races.
Since there was a long line of waiting, the competitions started and we had not yet left our bag behind at the entrance, although once done, the withdrawal was worse.
In addition, the rain accompanied the wait for more than 40 minutes during which rebellions and attacks took place in the barracks.
I believe that about 500 people will have pneumonia tomorrow, and some people like me, will not even be in the classification with the exact time, because of the chip they gave me who, I think, did not correctly mark the start.
Of course, if they asked me to cite an example of a perfect race, it would not come to my mind.
So I think we can always dream of becoming the host city for the 2016 J.O..
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT Microsoft Emerging Technologies conference, a new system of image recognition and human interaction was introduced, a kind of artificial intelligence with little intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to travel on the company's campus) in response to what was asked of him during a conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of forms and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people there are in the place, who they are - including remembering what positions they occupy - and listening to and hearing the key words of their conversations.
But also group them according to conversation groups
In the presentation video, the receptionist detects a third person but understands that she does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that she is not part of the company.
She asks if she's here to visit someone and tells her she'll answer in a few moments.
All this without blue screen.
Impressive.
But of course this represents the future.
Now the company has other things to focus on, for example on the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week we talked more about a change in strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and there will be no more associated programs.
Steve Ballmer discovered that if computers were sold with the indispensable instead of useless applications, they would go five times faster.
This represents a discovery since Microsoft, version after version, has continued to add features and "extras" to Windows.
The change of strategy is welcome.
Microsoft is right, its operating system loses importance but also its software.
When Google Chrome arrived on the network, I was one of those who adhered to the theory that Google Chrome is Google's first approach to competing with Windows.
Several people rightly pointed out that an Internet browser is not an operational system.
The operating system will always be necessary as it is the essential basis for computer hardware and software to be understood.
It occupies the same function as your wife or husband when you have to say something to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but we must see the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth but as a relative truth.
This week, Ballmer confirmed this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system, but more and more to the Internet browser.
We only turn on the computer to turn Firefox, Explorer or Chrome and every day people spend more time browsing the Internet than browsing windows.
Who serves half of the applications provided with the system?
Who can most can at least.
And Windows 7 will have to contain fewer applications, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, busy month, less complex.
For the moment, Microsoft is more interested in launching its own online services so that they will finally become an alternative to Google.
They desperately need this, indeed, and I show you an example.
The photo presented in this article was taken early this month in one of the rest rooms reserved for Microsoft employees in Redmond.
On the beverage distributor, a poster shows their request to use their own search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, a study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search for information on the Internet.
Last week a delay occurred in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not be released at the beginning of 2009 but by the end of 2009 or see in 2010.
Microsoft will certainly try to launch at the same time Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
After all, the phone looks more and more like a computer.
But the launch of Android is late and the iPhone is already on the market, it will cost them dearly.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore one on the Côte d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio wore it in Edward Zwick's 'Blood Diamond', as well as Al Pacino in 'Le Parrain' by Francis Ford Coppola and was part of the association of muscle gays.
And if we start to list all his appearances, we could also mention this mustache that raised weights in a walking circus.
It's not just a men's cotton, hand milling, and no sleeves.
The English call it 'tank' but the Fabulous Marcel de Bruxelles stands out among all the others.
First of all, by his flaming name - although he is known as ' Marcel' - who has to do with sport since he takes the name, according to legend, of boxer Marcel Cerdan, a lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
The ' Marcel' distinguishes itself from others by its excellent cotton, its unisex cut, its distinctive logo and the little Belgian flag (unrecognisable) that the best known body shirts have in their necks.
But be careful, because the Belgian brand not only produces top tanks.
But it also produces sweat-shirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, babes, mini-shorts...
Dresses designed for the comfort of undergarments.
Even if it's a shame to wear them only as underwear.
They have too much charm.
"I want to become a young mother; the candidate doesn't worry me"
His enormous resemblance to his sister did not prevent him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Currently, Sisters Cruz takes their new fashion activities very seriously.
According to Monica, they are not just beautiful and famous girls who give their name.
She was present at the promotion that the Mango brand made in Paris at its new headquarters but also at the presentation of the most important prices of fashion as the Spanish sponsor house.
Monica is warm and shy.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I created for Mango for the new fall-winter season, but also to attend the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the opera dinner in honour of Valentino.
A very intense day but, at the same time, exciting, awaits us.
On what basis is your new collection created for Mango for this fourth season?
The cinema of the 1950s and 1960s enchanted us and inspired us a lot for our collections.
I love to walk around town and watch women to see how they are dressed, how they combine their clothes, I often do it.
Dancer, actress and designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but in the end everything comes together and these activities have a lot in common.
Since I was a little girl, I liked my clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to look into my aunt's closets and see her clothes.
It was great, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, when I became a dancer, I always tried to take care of my dress.
Dancers really like to dress up for courses and tests, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress, when you wear clothes it's at this point that you actually put yourself in the character's skin.
All of a sudden, it's all tied up.
You haven't been there for 30 years. Was that hard for you?
Not at all.
I feel better than ever, my 30s make me happy.
I find that the woman is maturer, has more experience and enjoy life with fewer problems.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I have done all the things I wanted to do since I was a child and it has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, you think you're gonna become a mom?
Of course, I want to become a mother because my body asks me and, besides, I want to become a young mother; I don't want to lose it.
As far as the candidate is concerned, I am not concerned.
What I will do is to give my son a lot of happiness and raise him with a lot of love.
Let's go to the movies, you're waiting for the different movies you shot last year.
That's right, I'm looking forward to them coming out.
I'm a woman from the theatre, I'm very anxious and worried, I'd like to have everything now but of course it's not possible.
I look forward to the films 'The Last Hour' and 'In Search of the Tomb of Christ'.
See what you'll think...
A few days ago you started on the bridge with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Don't say that!
I didn't get on the bridge to make the model.
It's just, Naomi Campbell called me, I've known her for quite some time, to invite me to participate in a charity show in London for her association in support of women's support and the clothes we displayed - I exhibited two clothes from our collection created for Mango - were sold at auctions to collect money for Naomi's NGO.
People Naomi is a person with a tender heart.
They say so much about her, I know her, so much is not true.
Besides, this good side of Naomi fascinates me.
She asked me to parade for such a noble cause, but if she had asked me to do the dirt, I would have done it anyway.
The important thing is to make life better for women in the third world.
Alcohol repeaters on the wheel will have to install the 'alcock' system
The Minister of the Interior wants the driver who has had more than three administrative alcohol sanctions, to install in his vehicle a system that prevents the vehicle from starting drunk, or if he does not suffer.
The initiative was already announced last June and now appears in the report of the Minister of State in which this initiative is considered a pilot project that will last one year.
Its purpose is to reintegrate the driver by offering him road rehabilitation courses.
The Minister of State for Road Safety but also the Directorate-General for Road Safety and the Technology Institute for Automobile Safety Foundation will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists arrested for driving more than once in a drunken state resume the car.
Alcohol would avoid this because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the alcohol rate in the haloine and prevents starting the vehicle if the driver does not blow before; or when the driver's alcohol rate is higher than the permitted one.
Its cost is more than 1,000 euros and is borne by the driver.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with this device reduced up to 65% of the offences during the first year of installation.
And in Spain it is estimated that this could save 115 people every year.
This applies only to administrative sanctions for two reasons: dealing with such behaviours before they turn into criminal offences.
And facilitate its implementation, since legal reform can be done by ordinary means, but criminal reform requires reform of the organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial form, although some industrial and functional vehicles already have an experimental vehicle.
The Congress of Deputies will vote tomorrow for an initiative by the Spanish Socialist Party which proposes to install this system on school buses as has been done in France.
In Mexico without 'peep-toes'
At 5:40 p.m., the scheduled official time was the plane of the Spanish Air Force in which the Princes of Asturias traveled landed in the Presidential Hangar of the Airport Benito Juárez of Mexico DF.
The sun was on the eve of falling asleep, but its rays were still forced to lay hands as a visor in order to see the royal couple come down from the plane.
At the foot of the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities were present.
A few hours earlier I had asked the taxi driver in the street if he knew that the Spanish Princes were visiting the city to complete their official trip.
- Oh, all right, then we can't go to the airport to pick up customers at this hour... are you from here or so?
- No, no, sir, I'm Spanish, but I lived here thinking two years.
- Oh, all right...
But the Mexican press knows very well who are the Princes of Asturias and knows the importance of the trip.
They are several waiting in the airport hangar near the red carpet and a military row composed of 27 marine soldiers.
The Prince is smiling and clothed in marine blue, the Princess, when she has hair in the wind, is dressed very remarkably and does not wear her usual 'peep-toes'; perhaps they had told her that a storm was threatening.
They make a brief stop with photographers before going to the room where the official procession awaits them.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the four largest hotels in the city, a Rigolo journalist on Mexican television awaits them.
The most prestigious price of fashion
There is certainly no more suitable place in the world to present a fashion prize than Paris and there is certainly no living designer more extraordinary and good living than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the Mango Fashion Awards Button, in order to strengthen the international image of new fashion talents.
The winner will be rewarded at a price of €300,000.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at his models in the window of Mango at the 54 Haussmann boulevard in Paris and she cried almost with emotion.
It is certainly the second largest brand store in Europe that has just been inaugurated with 1,335 square metres of surface.
The first shop is in London.
The events, as well as the desire to thank the stylist Valentino, president of the competition jury, made us find ourselves in a luxurious dinner at the opera Garnier de Paris.
With the next table of the extraordinary Chagals family, the presidential table prepared by Mango, it seemed even more spectacular.
Having grown on the heart and making against bad good fortune good heart, because of the recent death of his brother, Nati put on a mango garment and a few ELAH beads, which cut off the breath, and arms on top, arms down with his son Luis - a beautiful man almost two meters high - she accompanied Valentino to her dinner prepared in her honour.
Andik, the owner of Mango, a gallant man, as well as the Baron of Rotchil ended the evening without a jacket because they had lent them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who presented herself at the store with a pair of pants and a shirt – from her own collection – and who, for dinner, metamorphosed by wearing a sexy and black long dress, was moved when during the night visit of the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us the rehearsal room of the ballets and recalling the good old time, she seized one of the bars and she made the gesture of a 'great fold'.
Ines Sastre did not stay for the visit of the palace's dependencies, but she first showed us on her mobile phone pictures of her son.
The following morning, we had the pleasure of seeing Olivier Martínez – another beautiful man who moves on a motorcycle – and John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his sheets, towels and having asked beforehand, that there are no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, here's life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are not only 1000 but 1001 ways to forget the chaos and frenzy of daily life.
And to crown the whole, they are all listed in a book that will bring relaxation to the booksellers on September 30.
The morning awakens us almost as he sounds at 7:00 a.m., but it's even worse when we think about the pace of the current life.
The office is synonymous with tension and the back pain computer.
Stress represents the evil of the 21st century.
But there are neither one nor two methods to combat daily fatigue and problems related to the world of work.
But 1001, not one more or one less.
Apart from yoga positions, classical massage or 'spa' treatments, Susannah Marriott gathers in the pages of a book a 'menu' of methods adapted to the taste and time of each.
The antistress work is called '1001 ways to relax' and will arrive at the booksellers directly from the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If anyone believes that it is not possible to obtain peace in places such as work or through personal relationships, this 'manual' denies such a belief.
In addition, this manual offers other methods such as contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that help you relax.
If adrenaline does not run in your veins to restore the balance of your body and if stress has become a problem, it is time to sit in the sofa, disconnect from your mind and focus on reading.
Talk in sleep
Some kids talk at night.
I do not refer to those who wake up very awake by telling us something that happened the day before, but to the children who speak during their sleep.
The first time this happens you may be surprised, but it really doesn't matter.
It's a benign sleep disturbance called sleepiness.
This is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure there's more than one talking during the night.
This phenomenon may appear very sporadic (once in life, for example associated with an episode of severe fever), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the day after the child no longer remembers anything.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance
They are often related to other sleep disturbances such as nightmares, night terrors, night sickness (beeping in bed) or sleepwalking, but this is not always the case.
As we have said before, they can also be associated with very strong fevers, stress or overexcitement situations.
Anyway, it's a little studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it occurs is also very variable.
He may speak with a quiet little voice, with isolated words, murmurs or instead with screams, cries, long speeches ...
In the event that sleepiness becomes very frequent, it would be wise to observe the child and consult a specialist, to check if there is a problem that causes much anxiety and to get an explanation for this problem.
We said it is a benign alteration, which is why there is no treatment, unless it is related to another sleep impairment that can be treated (e.g. if it is related to apnea of sleep or stress).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child before going to sleep.
Therefore look for quiet games and avoid programs or television series that are more or less violent.
With very nervous children who have difficulty relaxing, relaxation techniques can be used to help them calm down internally.
This will allow the child to have a more peaceful sleep.
As soon as sleepwalks appear try to remain calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will no longer remember what happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake him up.
It's useless because he's unconscious and you'd wake him up.
Even if he speaks, he sleeps and rests.
Remember that if he is very anxious several times, it is advisable to consult a doctor or check what causes so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not usual), do not be tempted to question him for information.
You won't get anything, because he's asleep, he's not aware to be able to organize his thinking.
In addition, you will hear what he says, but you will not know what he is dreaming of, then pay attention to the way you interpret the information and the conclusions you draw.
Never tell the child that you can interrogate him during the night to know his secrets.
Not even joking.
This causes a lot of anxiety.
In conclusion, don't worry, it's nothing very bad, it's an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illaeusern... finally
Illhaeuseern finally found the path of victory on his ground after a long period of distet.
Without making a big game, the Yellows and Blacks have created the largest number of opportunities and have succeeded in transforming one for the win of the game.
The pace was not very sustained during this meeting where the attackers had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by Captain Visitor Kauffmann who floundered the lucarne on a shot from afar, Illhaeusern was going to take slightly the ascendant and turn away Fonderflick from afar, then with Hirn above, Romain at the foot or Diebold came to haunt Dannemarie's defense.
In front of that, we'd block in the middle of the field and we'd just leave the Riahi move at the end of the attack.
The beginning of the second half-time was going to be decisive with first two occasions signed Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and soon after the opening of the score for the Illhousians by Marais, well positioned to resume a ball repulsed on a first attempt by Diebold (53e).
But the Illhousian buster will not be able to enjoy his happiness for a long time and will be forced to return the dressing rooms a dozen minutes later and leave his teammates in digital inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not be able to take advantage of it and will not pose any major problems to an Eleven Illhusian who just retreated a little to "compact" his defense, except in the last few seconds of the game where, after a big dive, the ball passed very close to the cross.
Sarkozy to meet angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy is going to take a trip through Brittany.
Faced with the demonstration of strength of the fishermen who strongly disturbed on Monday the access of several Breton and Norman ports, the President of the Republic decided to visit the port of Guilvinec on Tuesday morning in the Finnish Country to meet their representatives there.
They promised to welcome him "in a constructive spirit" and hoped that he would "come with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit that falls at the same time as a general meeting of the "crisis committee" created by the Breton fishermen to obtain measures in the face of the fluctuation of gas oil prices, which reached a record of more than 1.14 euros per litre on average.
According to Elysée David Martinon's spokesman, the president "will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their companies regain competitiveness and to secure the conditions of employment and remuneration of sailors".
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected to stand firm by fishermen.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out snail operations in Morbihan and Calvados, causing caps of nearly 10 km.
The port of pleasure of Quiberon was also blocked, but the links to Belle-Île were not stopped.
A filter dam was carried out on Quiberon Island.
The sailors have already shown their determination on Monday by burning, at dawn, tires and pallets in front of the fuel deposits of the ports of Brest, and Lorient, while demonstrations were taking place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports of the Atlantic facade and the Manche, such as the Sands of Olonne, Vendée, where the trawlers remained at docks, or the Havre, where about twenty vessels blocked the movements of commercial ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and the Croisic, in Loire-Atlantique, stopped in the evening the blockade of the important total refinery of Donges.
Those in Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until Wednesday's meeting was held in the department to decide on possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" must decide on Tuesday about the follow-up to the movement and its participation in the interview scheduled for the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by officials of the National Fisheries Committee, who did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "fishers will leave nothing" and "don't want to move to Paris", for example announced Liliane Cariou, the chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel fuel, currently pay about 50 cents per litre but consider that the threshold of profitability of a vessel is reached only with a gas oil below 0.30 euros per litre.
Paul Newman the Magnificent
The unforgettable performer of "Butch Cassidy and the Kid" died of cancer, at the age of 83, in his house in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford or Sam Mendes praised the legend of cinema and the actor engaged, Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecasts in 2008
The Brazilian aircraft operator is on 215 aircraft delivered this year in spite of the global economic recession threats.
The fourth world aircraft manufacturer, Embraer, maintains his 2008 delivery forecasts with 215 delivered aircraft, reaffirmed Fredrico Fleury Curado, his president.
In the first half, the aircraft delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer hopes much of the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft in the range of 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider giving over 15% of its assets
The American International Group, which the U.S. monetary authorities have reinvigorated, is considering giving over 15% of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion it has received, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is ready to study the sale of most of its activities beyond its international life insurance and retirement activity in the United States, states the newspaper which cites sources close to the file.
The AIG Board of Directors met on Sunday evening to examine possible transfers, according to the FT.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets of which AIG plans to separate include its subsidiary of International Lease Financial Corp. air leasing, its 59% share in the Transatlantic Holdings reinsurer and its real estate portfolio and investments in private equity, adds the FT.
No final decision has been made on these transfers, continues the FT.
AIG must quickly cash in order to repay the loan of 85 billion that the Federal Reserve has granted to it at the risk of the US authorities taking 80% of its capital, diluting the current shareholders accordingly.
Analysis Paris Session History Morning Meeting History Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange accused a historic fall Monday after the rejection by the House of Representatives of the Paulson Bank Rescue Plan: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a loss never seen approaching 800 points, and Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dived from 777.68 points to 1O.365.45 points.
In terms of points, the greatest drop in its history (684.81 points) had previously been recorded on 17 September 2001, on the day of the resumption of trade after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The technology-dominant Nasdaq index yielded 199.61 points to 1.983.73 and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points) to 1.106.55 points, according to final closing figures.
Already depressed at the beginning of the session, Wall Street sank after the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the Banks Rescue Plan which was expected to restore some stability in the markets.
By 228 votes against and 205 for, representatives refused the Secretary to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the means he requested.
Almost two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
"It's a bad signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"It shows the extent to which the market counted in this respect," she added, fearing that a project adopted in several days would not come "too late".
"If the project is indeed dying (...) then the relay will quickly pass to the Fed (the Central American Bank, Ndlr) and other central banks to manage the crisis, which would tighten the credit conditions," said Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight.
And increasing the sense of urgency, "every day that passes brings the fall of a financial institution" to the United States, pointed out Mrs. Piegza.
After Washington Mutual bankruptcy on Friday, the authorities organized the purchase of Wachovia's banking activities by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has suddenly accelerated, leading to emergency interventions for banks in the United Kingdom, the Benelux, Iceland and Germany, indicating that markets face "not only an American crisis, but a global crisis," said FTN Financial analyst.
The bond market has risen strongly.
The return of the Treasury Bond at 10 years of age declined to 3,632%, compared to 3,827% on Friday evening, and the return at 30 to 4,161%, compared to 4,357% on the previous day.
Obama, winner of the first TV duel
At the first debate on Friday between the two candidates at the White House, another happened to know who, from John McCain or Barack Obama, took him.
Without surprise, the Republican and Democratic campaign leaders proclaimed their own victory in this television duel which would have been followed by a third of the American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that the performance of John McCain, although honorable, has not been "bright enough" to allow him to delay his decline in the five-week presidential polls.
The Gallup Institute, whose opinion poll published on Saturday gives Obama a five-point advance (49% versus 44% in McCain), believes that it was the democrat who drew his finger out of the game.
In the undecided voters, who are the ones who count, Obama won 39% of the polls, while 25% of them gave McCain the victory, according to a CBS survey.
Obama should be able to confirm his advance on Thursday with the good performance expected from his colist, Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
She has good instincts," however warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
The seven-year-old McCain continued to highlight his undisputed experience in foreign policy, while stressing his opponent's "naïvety" on these issues that were at the heart of this first face-to-face.
"Senator Obama does not seem to understand that..." he has accused several times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge needed to be president," he said.
An angle of attack hammered since yesterday in republican television advertisements.
Obama stressed that he represented the future.
Without disassembling, he was concise and precise.
He highlighted his ability to make the right decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
"McCain has not yet understood, while Obama, if", retorted, this weekend, a democratic spot accusing the republican of not having taken all the measure of the impact of the crisis on the "American of the street".
"During the ninety-minute debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," said Obama, yesterday, in front of 20,000 people assembled for an election meeting in North Carolina under heavy rain.
He did not even pronounce the words "middle class" or "workers".The financial downturn clearly benefits Obama, who is considered by the Americans the most capable of saving the economy on the edge of the precipice.
"The coming week could be a decisive turning point," said the influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, an old Clinton administration, compared Obama's "good economic instincts" with that of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current debate "is the final eight-year verdict of a poor economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain."
Reaffirming, however, that 95 per cent of Americans would be able to reduce their taxes despite the riots of Wall Street, the Illinois senator also noted that the achievement of possible energy independence in the country through the promotion of renewable energy was his first priority, with the establishment of a health insurance system.
McCain, he, wanted to build a 45-nuclear power plant park by 2030.
Prudents, the two candidates avoided the financial rescue issues of $700 billion (€470 billion) adopted by Congress last night and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "Did you notice that there was an election?"
Young people and opponents manifested on Sunday evening at the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the legislation in advance.
A few hundred Belarus met on Sunday evening after the closure of the polling stations in Minsk central place to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislation.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexandre Loukachenko: "the dictator, resign".
Some confess that they didn't even vote: "What good, because they will do what they want from my voice," said one young man.
They do not believe that the regime that has made good the foreign observers with a view to regaining language with the European Union is ready to take a democratic turn.
Sanctions, including the prohibition of visas for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered to be clean by observers.
They were not against the opposition.
"We were kept apart from the electoral commissions and our observers were unable to participate in the decommissioning," lamented Iuri Potemkine, the spokesperson for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous grouping of twelve parties.
"It is a cosmetic change," said Alexandre Milinkievitch, former candidate for the opposition to the Presidential in 2006 and leader of the pro-European movement, because the important thing is who counts the votes, and in us, it is the executive power.
If members of the opposition come into parliament, they will have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament can mean space on television, meetings in the regions and proposals for laws."
The opposition must therefore enter into political play because " dialogue with the European Union must begin.
For if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, becomes a crisis, and we do not reform, we risk becoming a protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition feared that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that had followed the electoral process would not recognize the validity of the vote.
She pointed out that the participation figures appeared too high, and that the generalization of the advance voting (26% of voters in Minsk) opened the vote to all manipulations.
"Did you notice that there was an election, you?" asks Social Democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be no more than five Members of Parliament's opposition, those who are best suited to power."
The silence of the night returned to the place of October.
On television, President Loukachenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission welcomed their success.
Interview - Blood Safe Again
Héma-Québec celebrated yesterday the 10th anniversary of its foundation, and its president, Dr. Francine Decary, was right to rejoice because Héma-Québec became one of the world's most secure and effective blood providers.
And above all, he regained the public's confidence that had been seriously shaken by the blood scandal contaminated in the 1980s and 1990s.
As it is known, the national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were contaminated by the acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In February 1994 the Government of Canada initiated a public inquiry, chaired by Judge Horace Krever, which aimed to shed light on the circumstances leading to such a tragedy and to make recommendations so that such a disaster would not be repeated.
While Judge Krever was late to file his report, some provinces set up a committee to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this mandate.
Following the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Héma-Québec to serve Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to supply all other provinces and territories.
"In 1998, when Héma-Québec started his activities, only 38% of people still trusted in the blood system in Quebec, Dr. Decary recalled.
The situation was discouraging.
As a result of efforts to improve the safety of blood products and labour on the ground during the years that followed, we have regained public confidence," she said before proudly affirming that at the beginning of 2008, almost 94% of Quebec's population now had confidence in Héma-Québec.
However, Dr. Decary points out that "trust is something extremely fragile."
Since its inception on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, many cases of the human form of the mad cow disease, a new variant of the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, have emerged in Europe.
"And we did not know at all whether this disease could be transmitted by blood.
It was then based on one of the main recommendations in the Krever and Gelineau reports that when it is unknown and that a serious disease can result from it, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterized by a degeneration of the brain inevitably leading to death, exclusion measures are introduced.
In April 1999, the blood of people who had been living in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980 was refused.
But a few years ago, it was demonstrated beyond doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood.
This episode has shown us that the precautionary principle applied has meaning."
In 1999, a much more sensitive technique of HIV testing appeared on the market: nucleic acid (TAN) tests that allow donors to detect directly in their blood the presence of the virus itself and not the antibody against the virus, on which the tests used so far were based.
The TANs have made it possible to shorten the mute period, which extends between the time when the person was infected and where the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
This period could be reduced to less than a week.
This has substantially reduced the risk of some donors being infected without knowledge and cannot be detected.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS through blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
"In other words, it means that 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
As Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products annually, it will take more than 24 years before a case of transmission of HIV by a blood product occurs.
I believe that today one can feel comfortable receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to recover health," said the head of management of Hema-Québec.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
We never know which pathogen will emerge in the system.
Not later than last year the Chikungunya virus, like the West Nile virus, appeared on Réunion Island, was transmitted by an insect in the blood.
We must be constantly vigilant," continued Dr. Décary before pointing out that in addition to a secure supply, Héma-Québec must also provide for sufficient supply.
"Necessities increase because the population ages.
Since anticancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need a refill of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing population also has consequences on the blood donor network, which is on average only 3% of Quebec's eligible for blood donation."
Any person in health who is 18 years of age and over meets the eligibility criteria may, however, donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14 per cent of those who offer their blood are not accepted because they are infected with AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have traveled to a country where malaria is severe, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
"With these 3%, we manage to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Shortcomings are very rare.
But it is necessary to renew the members of this network of donors as they grow old and can no longer give their blood.
However, it is difficult to convince people to give their blood, but above all to hold them back and encourage them to become regular donors.
Today's life is so frightful, we rarely find the time to spend an hour giving of his blood," says Francine Decary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec provides not only blood products, but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eye cells and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These fabrics are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored at Héma-Québec, which also manages the only public bank of cord blood in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was previously considered a biomedical waste is full of blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat severe diseases, such as leukaemia.
"We celebrated a few weeks ago the banking of our thousandth sample of cord blood and we plan to collect more than a thousand each year.
We should start proposing them for grafts at the beginning of next year," says Dr. Decary, who describes this cord blood collection program as very popular.
"Many mothers are disappointed that there is no access," because Héma-Québec does not have the means to offer this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Soccer - The Impact in Half-Final
The Impact of Montreal was qualified for the semi-final round of the elimination series of the first USL division, thanks to a win of 3-1 (4-3 in total goals) at the expense of the Seattle Sounders yesterday, during the second and decisive match of the quarter-final series in total goals, at the Saputo Stadium.
The middle of the field Antonio Ribeiro marked the decisive goal at the 90th minute of play.
After a first half aimlessly on one side as on the other, the middle of the field David Testo and Rocco Plancentino marked the other nets of the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who played Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Remember that during the first round of the round round on Friday, the Impact had been defeated by 2-1 at Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, in the suburb of Seattle.
The Impact will be measured at the Vancouver Whitecaps in half-final.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, Thunder filled a 3-1 deficit in the return game to win it 4-3, but the Whitecaps also reached the 5-4 half-final round in total goals.
The Impact should confront the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
In brief - Victory goal of Kovalev
The trio number one of the Canadian is ready to begin the season.
The unit composed of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn fuelled the attack in a 3-2 Canadian draw at the Florida Panthers dams last night at the Bell Centre.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the meeting, scored a goal, Plekanec collected two aids, and Kovalev collected a pass in this win, the fourth of the Tricolore in six preparatory games.
Kovalev won the victory by marking the sole purpose of the shooting.
"I'm not ready yet, Russian has warned.
I need another game to feel comfortable."
"He tried to do too much in the first period," noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he enjoyed the end of the game.
He had a great ovation."
Charest on the North
The Prime Minister does not exclude triggering elections before the end of the year
Soon after the General Council of the Liberal Party ended, Jean Charest visited Jean-Talon in Quebec yesterday, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), tried to be elected during today's by-election.
"Rejecting the limits of our last great northern border": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual strength while remaining in the broad lines, at the end of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, a kind of Moulin was projected with images.
They circled, on three huge screens, spectacular clichés of hydroelectric dams, mining, Quebec seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Large means as in electoral times.
In the press, moreover, the Prime Minister refused to rule out that he would trigger the elections this fall, even though he pointed out that his schedule was very busy.
The "Northern Plan" is the fourth "vision" that the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes a labour agreement with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the Prime Minister's recent speeches, the opening of the North - the northern territory at the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, did not explain why the North was "a jewel with immense potential", but did not give a deadline, investment amounts, nor a precise priority in future projects.
At least a few avenues of what could be further developed: in particular hydropower, forest, but above all the mining sector, supported by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamond", according to Mr. Charest's listing.
This "territorial twice as large as France", "it's at home, it's in Quebec.
Not only is it home to us, but it is within us," he insisted, as if to show that he was asking for a national founder myth.
Quebec has built a lot in its relationship with the North, he stressed: the golden road in Abitibi, the Quebec engineering, the James Bay.
"It's ours, it's our future," he added, having taken a theatrical pause to contemplate the immense map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec territory, includes a portion of the Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, said the Prime Minister at the press station.
"It is a traditional position that all governments have reiterated.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a long time and, when the opportunity arises, I repeat this position on behalf of the government," he said.
Furthermore, "with climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the North," he said, speaking of the northwest passage, which will open all year round due to the melting of ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that occupying the territory is a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, First Nations and Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, especially young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pakistani MP of Ungava), have already begun consultations with some thirty communities.
An interdepartmental committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important place has begun work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a great meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a time when "we will give ourselves a common vision".
North development would also be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be "concerted, orderly and environmentally friendly," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as continuing with that of the Liberal prime minister who preceded it.
"Like the Liberals who have preceded us, we have thought differently to turn the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was also one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which started on Friday by a great cocktail to highlight the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage at the head of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Beauharnois Central in Adélard-Godbout Barrage.
"De Godbout, who created Hydro-Québec, in Lesage who made the Quiet Revolution and Nationalization of Hydroelectricity, in Bourassa who made the Bay James, our party has been able to forge the future," said Jean Charest.
In the press, he invoked another reference, conservative, the "Roads to the North" program by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
In addressing the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, Mr.Charest stressed that its deployment was planned for 2012.
"This remains between us, but I plan to be there," he entrusted his militants, raising sustained applause to them.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and probably not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of triggering an election this fall, which is permitted by law.
He stressed, however, that his schedule was filled, including a mission by the Council of the Federation in China and a Quebec-New York Summit.
The General Council of the weekend provided the Liberal Chief with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, including "constitutional aspirations" that were passed as a letter to the post: the PLQ in particular calls for recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
He also wished Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission and to have a veto over decisions made in Quebec.
On the opposition side, the main lines of the North Plan were welcomed with skepticism.
The Pakistani leader, Pauline Marois, pointed out the North Quebec Development Policy that the Landry government had launched in 2001.
According to her, the Liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, gave up its implementation.
If he had done so, "we would be more advanced today" commented Ms Marois alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (voting today), Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ said it supported the Government's adoption of a North Plan.
"But what we want is that it's not just a show," commented Sébastien Proulx leader, in place of Mario Dumont, who returns on vacation today.
Letters - A Dishonored Country
It was Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (or irony) in Harper's office, who had been able to say last summer about Louise Arbour that she was a "honest" for Canada.
To put the blame on this woman who has waged an endless struggle for justice and who deserves our admiration by saying as much about the Prime Minister's entourage as about Stephen Harper himself.
We are faced with a government which is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, to have not repatriated its national imprisoned in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
A government that does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager at the time of the facts against him.
The only government that, despite Canada's signing of the Geneva Convention, denies its word and allows a child soldier to be killed under inhuman conditions.
The only one who goes to a parody of justice to assess the guilt of the accused.
Let us remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of the Canadian Bar, inter alia, advocate for the repatriation of Omar Khadr for a fair trial in Canada.
It is this same government that closes its eyes on torture: it does not matter whether a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, probably forever after so many years of action.
We are not aware of this yet, but at this moment we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy", this word that Harper keeps branding and that sounds so hollow in his mouth.
Here comes the time when no morale exists anymore: one can harm, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen according to the good will of a head of government up to this minority (so it will be after October 14...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that advocates the Vertu, the Law and the Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what made our country's reputation and dignity.
Shame, Mr. Toews, she's here in this resignation, and not elsewhere.
Free opinion - The Orwellian speech by Barrick Gold
In his September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Patrick J. Garver, Canadian Mining Vice-President Barrick Gold.
Pursuing an Orwellian logic, it asserts that the world's largest gold company has attempted a defamation of six million against three authors and a small publishing house without the blow in order to launch a "transparent public debate".
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of defamation prosecutions, but the law.
Without surprise, this fundamental difference is completely concealed by Mr. Garver.
Because for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to bring to ruin anyone who dares to support a position contrary to his own?
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the authors and publishers of the book Black Canada will have to spend considerable amounts to prepare their defence and to fight, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by nearly bottomless pockets of mining.
Tactics, in these unequal struggles, are often to ruin the defendants in order to impose a friendly settlement that will strike the opposition in addition to frightening anyone who dares to reconsider the issue.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was in public opinion that she should have presented her vision of the facts.
Contrary to what is done in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, discussions in Canada are normally done by exchanging ideas rather than by slamming them.
It was therefore sufficient for the mining industry to open its books, records and establish a real debate, through newspapers, the media, publications and funding of independent research teams that could have shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to trust public opinion and rejects petitions and letters of support to Black Canada's authors.
Perhaps Mr. Garver could explain how he could at the same time request a "public" debate while disregarding the views of the same audience?
In the vice-president's world, it seems that this word refers only to fattening lawyers paid, not to all Canadians; this is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In democracy, even detractors have the right to speak.
What you don't understand - or don't want to understand - Barrick Gold is that the public supports Black Canada's authors and publishers primarily because it rejects the brutal way of mining.
This public is ready to hear Barrick and judge, but on the basis of civilized exchanges of arguments, and not in the context of what many perceive as a bulwark prosecution (continuing the "public debate", Barrick Gold has also filed a standstill with the authors of Black Canada inciting them to stop using this term...).
Beyond Mr. Garver's surreal speech, the pursuit of Barrick Gold is a direct attack on academic freedom of research and the quest for truth, essential to any democratic society.
It denies, in a bloc, the right to quote credible sources and to debate facts and interpretations, which are the very basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss topics that are displeasing to rich companies in this world in a country such as Canada, subject to repeat prosecution, who will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could do so by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Black Canada.
She has a right to reply.
The academic environment, which we belong to, has long known how to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's step-by-step action clearly shows that, contrary to her claim, she has no desire for a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the academic world, as it is for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place mechanisms to limit such abusive prosecutions.
Wall Street Rescue Operation - Democrats and Republicans Agree
The Bush administration and the heads of the Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the largest economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the US$700 billion plan to curb the financial crisis that has rocked Wall Street for months must still be endorsed by both Congress Chambers.
In particular, it provides: better control by the electors of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of public money committed, new provisions to contain the number of houses seized for default of payment, as well as a right to look at wages paid to the leaders of the assisted companies.
American Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday at the end of a two-day negotiating marathon.
"We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be effective on the markets," said the representative of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson.
"Everything has been done to protect the real economy and ordinary Americans from the ongoing crisis on Wall Street," the democrat explained.
"This is the fundamental point: if we don't do this, the trauma, chaos and disturbances on the daily lives of Americans will be immense," said Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had been sprinted in the last few hours in fear of the effect of a further failure on investors' mood.
The deadline for opening up the markets was this morning.
The two candidates for the U.S. presidential election, who were later associated with negotiations, were rather favourable to the agreement, although they did not fail to express their discontent that they were forced to reach this end.
Senator Democrat Barack Obama has given himself the addition of certain provisions to the agreement, including that of allowing the owners to retain their homes and the salary of state-recovery business leaders.
"When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there is no welcome.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on the American television waves.
Asked about another channel to see if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, said, "I'd like to see the details, but I hope so."
"The big lines I've read show that it's something we're all going to have to digest and with which we're going to be able to move forward.
The option of not doing anything is simply not acceptable," he said.
The 700 billion plan aims to redeem with taxpayers' money the suspicious, risk-active and unsold claims of U.S. financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis triggered by the breakdown of a real estate bubble that first led to the collapse of risk mortgage credits (subpressed) before expanding to other more widespread forms of credit securities (CCAs) and leading to liquidity freezes and bank and financial institution deficits.
It was a group of elected Republicans who had brought forward the first draft agreement last week.
It is believed to have come out of this deadlock since Democrats have agreed that some "toxic" assets of companies in difficulty are only insured by the government, rather than purchased.
In order to round the angles for everyone in Congress, a provision has also been added stipulating that if the government were to incur losses for five years with this program, it could put in place new taxes to help it recover its implementation.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first tranche of 250 billion to be added to another 100 billion if the President deems it necessary.
The payment of 350 billion more should be endorsed by another vote of the Congress.
In exchange for its aid, Washington will obtain shares in the assisted companies that will be worth dividends in the event of profit and that it will be able to resell when the storm is over.
The federal government will have the opportunity to delay the seizure procedures for housing related to the real estate loans concerned by this plan, as well as to set limits on compensation and severance allowances paid to the leaders of the affected companies.
The architects of the plan would like to see him put to the vote in the House of Representatives today, and in the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will have the green fire.
In fact, votes continued to rise against this project yesterday, both in the Republican and Democrat camp.
"Of course, Washington does not hear you," said Republican Scott Garrett, member of the House's Finance Committee, to his constituents.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one that consists of taking advantage of taxpayers."
Animator of a small group at Congress called "the caucus of skeptics", Democratic representative Brad Sherman presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred eminent economic professors, including three Nobel Prizes, wrote to tell us: Congress is asked not to hurry and carefully examine the way to go," he said yesterday.
At the same time, there was once again evidence of the global nature of the crisis in Europe.
At the end of an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion US).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been made necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas reported that it had refused to acquire its competitor in full shipwreck since it lost EUR 2 billion (US 2.9 billion) in the crisis of risky real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and ten largest insurers.
"This is not lost money," said Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
In return, a right to vote in the bank and influence is regained.
It is just something that savers and households now appreciate that the times are making an announcement of uncertainty."
Meanwhile, on the other side of the Channel, the British government seemed to be planning to nationalize another bank damaged by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would recover all outstanding loans from the Bradford and Bringley Bank, of which more than 41 billion (75.5 billion US) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy the British bank's branches and client accounts.
The Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after the Northern Rock, that the British government should nationalize from the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a committed icon
His beauty in the eyes of blue was long his own card, of some will say his weakness.
Had he been released from the narcissistic mirror, the American actor with a charming smile?
Yes and no.
Its stink, sensitivity and talent flowing from source will also have moved it away from the register of power that brings forth the true sacred monsters.
But what a great racer!
Paul Newman, who disappeared on Friday at 83 years of age from lung cancer in his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last icons of American cinema in the early years.
Less monumental than Brando, whom he resembled and whose long was a kind of rival on screen, more cautious in his game, certainly more fragile, but also apostle of the freedom and the breakdown of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often makes beautiful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, from a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother of origin.
From these European roots one of the glorious faces of the American dream will be born.
No self-measured, last quality brand.
Because in the early 1950s he projected a country steeped in self-made man, the Pacific war fighter, injured in combat, who studied dramatic art in Yale and then attended the Actor's Studio in New York, before winning the theatre, television, soon at the cinema.
This same man who was a civil rights activist was also the driver who ranked second at 24 hours of the Mans in 1979, doubled with a sex symbol, although a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
The shadow zones of this secret, discreet, engaged, allergic star also disappear with him at the explosions of the show-business, of which the enigma will not be fully crossed.
An honest man, in the noblest sense of the term.
Paul Newman's disappearance brought vertigo to the cinemas this weekend, while his great roles on the black screen of memories clash.
More than half a century of a seventh American art in perpetual mutation parade through it.
The charming cow boy of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man rejecting his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in La Chatte on a suitable heating roof of Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), his sensitive Mr Bridge, troubled in his old age by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
So many other Paul Newman have gone to history.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, offender, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Likes Me (Hate Marked), by Robert Wise, a role for James Dean, resumed after his death, who actually launched Newman in 1956.
This sympathetic villain in the brilliant The Sting (L'Arnaque), Oscar of the best film in 1973.
A bitter and vengeful billiard player in Robert Rossen's magnificent The Hustler (1961), he will resume the character on the return in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which in 1987 earned him his only Oscar on nine appointments.
That face through ages, it was him.
He's still there.
The eras fluctuate through its course.
Young people know him mainly through George Roy Hill's cultiastic Slap Shot (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of an orthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
With a final role as sponsor of the Irish Mafia in Road to Loss of Sam Mendes in 2003, the loop was looped.
Against several film legends that left early, Newman would remain in the saddle long while denouncing Hollywood, its bears, its faces and concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered him, not without humour, "as a living challenge to "underplaying" judging his benefits too supported.
The profession has not always been tender for the beautiful Paul Newman to whom the roles lie long and well cooked in the beak.
However, he played less often the young first than the marginals: neuroses, alcoholics, salauds or desperate, whose perfect traits reflected the drifts and revolts.
As a director, Newman revealed ill-known facets of his true prudence.
His wife, Rachel, in 1968 (according to Canadian novel Margaret Laurence), along with his wife Joanne Woodward in the main role, drew an end to the female portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott by overdose dedicated his film Harry and Son to him in 1984, a work of smell and sadness.
Among the rain of tributes yesterday on Newman, his great friend and former comrade Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, very saddened: "His presence has made my life and this country better."
Generosity, love of existence are vibrant traits of the missing actor.
Beyond his legendary career, he is also a great activist for civic rights, ecology, independent cinema, a contestant of Hollywood's drifts.
Many of his beaks have been seen riding on vinegar pots, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging the process of rather bad taste, although gag at first.
However, the profits of these sales were paid to its Children's Foundation in difficulty.
Newman, rather than sitting on his myth, will be committed to the very end.
He left his five daughters with a letter containing these phrases: "Always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there."
And a privilege for us to have followed the path of such a brilliant and generous American artist.
Citizens model, in sum and in addition.
What could Zuschlag &amp; Company do in their invoice factory?
Next, on 8 October, the hearings will begin in connection with the ongoing criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his accomplices.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of fraud, in the form of criminal organization, permanently and on a regular basis, resulting in particularly significant damage, and other charges have been held against them, such as false and false.
According to the prosecution, the money from subsidies was spent for personal purposes, while the benefits were justified by false invoices.
The state and municipalities' money, about 65 million HUF in total, went on the one hand in the funds of the Fiatal Baloldal movement and on the other, in the pocket of some people.
Their method, also made public by the authorities responsible for the investigation, was to reach the money from the subsidies obtained by issuing invoices of fees, behind which no actual benefit was provided and thus, the associations never complied with their commitments.
According to the indictment, a large part of the invoices were false.
For the latter, they were looking for invoice books in the Józsefváros market, while they were manufacturing the stamps in Kiskunhalas.
For the names of companies that would appear on the invoices, it was decided, among other things, during the tours in the northern province of Lake Balaton, carried out by István Lados, at the request of János Zuschlag.
According to the latter's statement, he had to find pensions and restaurants.
For his personal consumption, he asked for an invoice, on which they made the other invoices they were going to introduce, inter alia, to the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as to the Municipality of Capital to access subsidies.
The majority of invoices were created by István Lados and his partner András, who, according to our information, was mainly concerned with drafting the necessary files for obtaining subsidies.
During a "finding circuit", one of Lados' choices was a bistro.
According to the two invoices issued by the Zuschlag in 2003, this place ensured the restoration of a group of 90 people, members of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület.
However, according to the manager, it would have been impossible for so many people to occupy this place at the same time.
Similarly, in the summer of 2002, the invoice drawn up on behalf of the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, which later became the name of Együtt a Harmadik Évezredert, was a criminal offence of form and substance.
A pension, located in Badacsonytomaj, actually had only three bedrooms, and a maximum of ten people could spend the night there. However, the invoice mentioned one hundred and thirty customers.
The invoicing bill issuers also fell into excess when they mentioned the company Pigal Kft, also belonging to the Horeca sector. In their accounting, neither the name Jobb Jövőért nor the name of Hoppá appeared, according to the information given to the prosecution.
Győző Farkas, the manager of the company, told the site hvg.hu that when the prosecution summoned him and showed him the invoices, he immediately knew that it was false documents.
"The name of our company and our tax number were placed in a bad place on the cache."
He added: "Aside from the form, the fact that according to the invoice, a hundred people had stayed there, neither did it glue, since this establishment has only eleven rooms, which do not have as much room.
In addition, the invoice also mentions meals, and our restaurant has been closed for a long time."
In addition, there was no information on the travel agencies in Budapest, as part of their choice, but only organizing travel abroad. Thus, in fact, they reported stays in Hungary on cash bills, which also goes against the agency's accounting practices.
Overcrowded, as it appeared during the investigation, they also added VAT on these documents, while the travel services, the destination of which is outside the European Union, are invoiced without VAT.
Similarly, the VAT rate of the four invoices established on behalf of the Hotel Revefülöp in the order of Jobb Jövőért was incorrect, since the company's benefits did not bear a VAT of 25% as indicated, but a VAT of 15%. Furthermore, the hotel's employees issue only printed invoices, while the fakes were handwritten.
The prosecutor's investigation shows that "emitters" have also made mistakes by mentioning as a provision the carriage of goods by road, that the company issuing invoices could not exercise, since its profile was the investment council.
In addition, it is also for vices of forms, such as types of incorrect invoices and false stamps, that invoices issued in the order of Együtt a Harmadik Évesredért Alapitvány, of XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont proved false.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or Kunfehertó sports internship, both of which are the authors of the invoices issued on their behalf.
Faussaires also paid no attention to the fact that HIB Kft., established in Nyíregyháza, was in liquidation at the time (in 2001) the group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület was supposed to have a meal at their home. According to our information, that is why the liquidator of the company refused to issue this invoice.
Deliberately established facts
Another category of invoice issuers is that composed of those who were fully aware that they were required to issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alapitvány Foundation, at the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták Group, established an invoice at the order of the Együtt a Harmadik Évezredert Foundation, for a sum of four million HUF.
According to the indictment, the manager of Collab Kft. was led to issue false invoices by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi.
Similarly, it cooperated with the Zuschlags, the company Biogate Kft., which is currently under liquidation and which in 2003 issued invoices in the order of the foundation Jobb Jövőért Alapitvány, the Atlasz Egyesület association and the association Vörösfenyő Egysület, for an amount of about five million HUF, but behind which no benefits were actually provided.
Neither did any financial movement take place, since the invoices issued were subsequently cancelled, but this prevented the organizations from mentioning them in their accounts.
The following category of invoicing companies is that of companies directly related to the accused.
For example, the administrative delegate of the Director General of Delta Trió Kft., dealing with the trade in fuel and motor vehicles, whose head office was in Budapest, but where it could be found, was Ivan Kubatov.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices for the sale of computer equipment, amounting to approximately 18 million HUF.
According to the investigation, these equipment would have been purchased by Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which had been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The director of this company was a man of Romanian origin, to whom Ivan Kubatov would also have submitted documents related to the company, between 2002 and 2005.
According to what we know, Kubatov acknowledged during his investigation that he issued invoices in the order of the companies Atlasz, Hoppá and Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapitvány, and that he imposed their countervalue.
It was precisely at Ivan Kubatov's request that Romanian masons created Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In fact, none of these companies worked, which the accused explained by the fact that they did not receive work.
He still used these companies, since at the request of Master Zsolt Szente, co-accused and editor of the founding acts of the companies, he established invoices for their names, in the order of associations related to Zuschlag, such as the Atlasz and Y-Generásó associations.
Kubatov gave to organizations, 15 total invoices, issued by Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade companies, for a value of HUF 14.2 million.
The parquet thought that 10% of the amounts indicated on the invoices as well as VAT were in Kubatov's pocket.
The man even used the company Szi-Beri Bt. to establish fictitious invoices that were used in the context of the Biztos Pont grant application.
In January 2006, the Association Y-Generácó and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországert filed a grant application with the public utility organization of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapitvány (TMA).
They received this subsidy twice 500,000 HUF, but these amounts were not used for the objectives indicated in the application.
To prevent this being known, five fictitious invoices received from Works Team Kft. were presented to the TMA.
In addition, these invoices were found during the search in the office of Árpád Kemecsei, in the Ministry of Education.
At the hearing, part of the accused will report the method of making invoices, as she had previously done before the prosecution.
What might be really interesting is that the principal defendant, János Zuchlag himself, decides to lift the veil over all history.
So far, his confessions are not very detailed, and although he has promised several times to tell the smallest details, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest, or whether, possibly, the socialists would have concluded an agreement that in exchange for the reimbursement of a large part of the 50 million HUF, Zusi would bear only the hat.
Today, the latter is probably vexed, since the requests for his placement in supervised residence, on the basis of a relief from his detention conditions, are continually falling into the ear of a deaf person.
While those who have caused much greater damage, and the perpetrators of unreparable economic crimes, walk freely or at least, wait for their own home at the end of the procedure.
The psychology of the auction: why do we spend more money?
During auction sales, buyers tend to spend more, and overestimate the goods.
Researchers in neurology and economics at the University of New York have succeeded in updating the neurological and economic bases of this apparently irrational known behavior.
According to their study published in the journal Science, human beings do not want to be separated during this type of competition, such as a sale on eBay auctions, which is why they prefer even to pay too high a price.
These researches tried to draw up a neurological pattern of this kind of "game" using experimental auction sales.
One of the volunteer groups played in the loto, while the other group took part in a play auction, while using a functional magnetic resonance (MRI) process, researchers analyzed the active brain domains of experimental subjects.
In both games, participants could earn money, but during the sale to auctions, one essential element of which is the over auction of a third, the whole being under the brain stem, called striatum, was moved intensively during the loss of the party.
This part of the brain, alongside several other functions, plays a role in the mechanism of "self-stimulation" of the nervous system.
This is why, according to researchers, the rise in prices is explained by the leak in the face of the violent response of the striatum.
In support of their theories, the economists of this group of researchers continued financial monitoring analyses.
In these cases, three groups were over-involved against a partner in various circumstances.
They simply informed the control group of the actual value of the product in question, and they did so.
To another group, they promised that if, in addition, they were winning the game, then they would receive an additional $15 in reward.
While the third group received this $15 prior to the auction, the members of the group also lost that money, in case they lost the auctions.
The difference between these two groups is in fact that the emphasis was placed on one on victory, while the other on failure.
By proving the hypothesis of neurologists, members of the team of players "against failure" were willing to put higher than those performed by the control group and the "for victory" group.
"These results cannot be demonstrated by any existing economic theory.
In fact, each of them explained the phenomena observed in auction sales only by the pleasure of winning and the parade before the risk.
Only the neurological imaging methods helped eliminate the contradiction between the two theories by leading, now, to a third explanation." - Andrew Schotter, professor of the Faculty of Economic Sciences of the University of New York, observed.
Hepatitis: When should we consult a doctor?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while chronic liver disease is mentioned among the first causes of death in Hungary.
It is estimated that patients with hepatitis virus in Hungary are 100 miles away, but only seven miles are treated. This is due to the fact that patients often do not know they are carriers of the virus.
Hepatitis name is a generic name given to infections affecting the liver and caused by different viruses.
There are many similarities between their symptoms. Inflammation of the liver and yellowness are characteristic, but pathogens and diseases generated differ from one another.
Hepatitis viruses, according to pathogens, are mainly spread in two forms: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tube (e.g. contaminated food or water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses by blood and organic fluids (sperm, vaginal secretion, saliva).
For travellers, vaccination against A and B viruses is recommended. There is no vaccine against C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after the consumption of contaminated foods, generally accompanied by a poor general condition, weakness, stomach disease and nausea.
Then it develops on the skin and on the white eye a visible yellowness, the saddles become clearer and the urine takes a darker color. The healing can take two to three weeks.
Around the world, every year, one million people die in the most severe form of this pathology, such as liver cancer or cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main cause of this is that, according to estimates, only one in ten patients receive medical treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: if it is not treated, it can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most of the patients do not know how to reach the virus, because the pathogen destroys liver cells in a sneezing manner. In many cases, the first symptoms only appear after 20 to 30 years.
Therefore, early prevention is very important, as well as regular testing.
Contamination is much higher than the average among a population of three groups: people who had a blood transfusion prior to 1991, drug users and tattoos.
Currently, there are 200 million patients with chronic hepatitis C in the world.
Since the disease can be detected by a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to consult your doctor who treats symptoms of unknown origin as soon as symptoms are observed.
The disease can be cured if it is detected in time. The virus can be eradicated from the body, thus the risk of infection disappears and the development of cancer is prevented.
30 September is the world day of hepatitis, first organized in 2004 by agencies representing patients from all over the world.
Its aim is to draw attention to the cirrhosis of the chronic liver caused by viruses, the causes of its development and the importance of early diagnosis of the disease.
Does he who believes in God feel less pain?
According to recent research results, religious belief would function as some kind of analgesic, which would have already contributed to making the death of Catholic martyrdom more bearable.
The British daily Telegraph published an article that researchers at Oxford University have had an interesting experience in analyzing how belief in God could influence tolerance to the pain of the human being.
As part of this experience for the least odd, 12 Catholic believers and so many atheists were subjected to electroshocks, while each of them observed a painting representing the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude much of the suffering.
Thanks to a technique of palpation of the human brain, it was also discovered that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain responsible for the regulation of pain.
This analysis is the first of a series of experiences, which are attended by academics, scholars, philosophers and theologians from different sectors of the university.
Specifically, the experience is carried out as follows: an instrument emitting sparks and disseminating electroshocks is fixed on the left hand of the experimental subject.
The researchers asked participants of the experience to look in a sustained way at two paintings, one being the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and the other, the Lady with the Hermine painted by Leonard de Vinci in the 15th century.
The researchers at the origin of this experience hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary evoked a kind of state of faith among the believers, while the choice of the painting of Da Vinci, not very different from the first, concerned its soothing effect.
Experimental subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and during that time, they received 20 electroshocks in four succeeding parts, while looking either at the religious theme painting or the more general theme painting.
The Catholics stated that in the eyes of the Virgin Mary, they felt like "safe", as someone whose "care" is taken care of and they "calmed, and peace invaded them".
In view of the painting of religious theme, they reported 12% pain less than when they looked at Leonard's work.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who himself took part in the experience, believes that we can achieve the same effects with any other strong image, in the atheists, provided we find the appropriate photo.
"We should find an image against which they react very positively, such as a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
Tom Wright, Anglican bishop, welcomed the results of these researches.
"The practice of faith should change and in many cases change our personality," Wright added.
After these excellent results, there remains only the question of what would be the effect on the regulation of the pain of the subjects if one shows believers a Madonna painted by Léonard or by a painter of the same size?
Would the view of a better quality Virgin Mary lead to better results?
You're what you're talking about.
On the occasion of his tenth anniversary, Google claims that it can be found at the bottom of the people's pocket in the same title as the sky above their heads. He knows where they have spent their holidays, what specialists they consult and what their centers of interest are.
However, it is still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, who is one of the influential people of society.
While with regard to skeptics setting a parallel with Orwell's horror vision, they do not see the bulk of the web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google's main ambition is to gather even more information about its users. This is necessary to enable Google's founders to meet their original goal that sounded as follows: "We collect all the information in a system of the world!".
According to the Google leader interviewed, after ten years of global exchange work, they are still only at the beginning of their objectives of being able to process all the information.
The question: what will happen in five years? Schmidt answered that he would like Google to answer questions like "What could I do tomorrow?" or "What would I do best?". However, software will only be able to answer this kind of question, simple at first sight, on the day when they know enough about users.
It is not perfectly clear to all Internet users that the words used during Internet searches, the IP address of the computer that launches the search and the pages subsequently consulted by the interested persons are precisely listed.
Through the Custom Search program launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own research history and consult what they have searched for, what they have clicked on. Thanks to this, in the long term, Recommendations, program based on the same logic, will be able to give much more personalized answers, and will submit products and services based on our previous statements and registered preferences.
What happens if someone uses my data against me, if he looks at what my job is? ask users, who are worried about Google's monopoly of information.
In most cases, it is the potential power represented by society that can cause fear, and it is not guilt, fear of punishment, desire for freedom or possibly revolt against power that can provoke counter-reaction among netizens.
However, it is confirmed that the terms sought are not only registered, but in justified cases, they are passed on to a third party, and in such legal cases nothing protects the personal rights of netizens.
The most striking example of recent times is probably coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google transmitted to the Brazilian government the information it had collected on the public page called Orkut, thus allowing identification.
Netizens concerned about human rights were able to raise a sigh of relief last May, when Google, holding on to the EFF electronic legal protection agency, has proven its right to the court against the FBI. According to the judgment rendered, in the future, Google will still not be obliged by any of the points of the constitution to disclose information on the FBI's secret request, of any kind.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully obtained some 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms it had won in relation to the strengthening of the Child Protection Act, voted several years before. But ultimately, it failed to obtain the lists of searches from private users, nor the full list of websites and keywords in the last two months.)
Google's judgment is therefore quite contradictory: it is flogged by those who fear the transmission of their personal data, because they think that their intimate sphere and their private domain suffer from it when they begin to use Google services. Therefore, they attack them in the spirit of rebellion that they manifest against multinational companies proud of their conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its "savegeons" bringing together the passionate, activists and enthusiastic users of the computer that appear in many countries see in Google the next generation of big companies, the "connected corporation", as opposed to its rival, Microsoft, categorized as an invasion of the world because of Windows, and this, even though both are fighting for the same goal.
This can be explained by the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for identification code, does not ask for money for its applications. The documentary code and program package, continually refreshed, has a much more accessible, younger and cooler effect, compared to the practice of the official software giant.
The reason may also be that geeks see very exactly the problematic relationship between human rights and the internet, and what web 2.0, the most proclaimed key word in recent years, draws right behind it.
In fact, web 2.0 concerns nothing but collaboration, but the fact that we intentionally leave traces behind us, and that we use channels of communication made available to us, and while the dimension of them changes one by one, the main thing remains the same: one exposes itself.
A young person, in general, can hold a profile on several public pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and he can even link them to other services, such as Twinter, or last.fm, listing his musical habits. Then he can link them to a tracking system, such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. These youth can also hold blogs, in which they automatically appear their latest photo galleries that they store on Flickr or Picasa.
While many examples can be learned, such as that of the girlfriend who easily understands the morning photos, taken by the circle of common friends, with whom her unfaithful friend spent the evening, or that of the society that fired one of her employees, nothing but for the honest opinions that she wrote on her blog about top management, one can be on one thing: the term of privacy is totally to be reconsidered today.
The one who lives an online life, is made up of what he shows himself, and so one can define the principle by hiding behind the behaviour of today's youth.
He wants to hide something, or at least he wants to try to circumvent Google's monopoly, he can do it (starting, for example, with Scroogle, using Google's search system, but at the same time deliberately leaving no trace).
The number of people who deliberately do not register on public pages so that it is not possible to find them, is not fewer. Google services online, passing through the processing of text to image processing, reading information can be replaced by alternative versions, which are not linked to huge server parks and which do not assemble our best profile, which have existed so far.
Public opinion awaits, without really hiding, the moment when Google will reveal its true nature.
The company, with its current value of $156 billion, is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion). AdWords/AdSense advertising areas threaten the turnover of advertising agencies, while the benefits introduced at an ever-increasing speed lead to serious migrants not only to Microsoft, but also to many other computer program creators.
However, critical observers find, in addition to all of this, contradictions with disturbing effects: for example, the top management of the company has rejected, in its entirety, the protests of employees, after it has doubled the price of the company's maternal and after the company has considered the multiple daily restoration too costly, taken any time. All of this seems to be hilarious alongside the fact that Google has acquired before the Chinese government in 2006, and according to the terms of their agreement, the company detects all the results that harm the good taste, as well as the interests of the Chinese regime.
According to one of the company's internal rules, new services are not announced only when they can be used. What is certain is that in the coming months and years, they will move the world on new points. While some think that Google's book and magazine scanning and archiving project takes on such important dimensions that the company will soon be confronted with the U.S. Supreme Court, others tremble before its Health system, because in this, we can build a complete medical profit from our results of previous analyses, our doctors and our problems.
The fact that Google builds a genetic database can give good raw material to the next generation of science fiction authors. The novel of the famous Cory Doctorow, written with Orwellian half-tons, describes the future in which a man could be approached in a dazzling way only through Google's data.
Two minors helped eliminate the traces of ozd's double homicide
"The police summoned two minors to interrogate them in the case of the double murder of Ózd. According to well-founded suspicions, they helped eliminate the traces of the crime." - said the spokesperson of the department of Borsod.
Young people have acknowledged the facts that are being blamed, and for the moment they are accused of complicity.
The two minors, who, according to information from MTI (Hungarian Telegraphic Agency) are young girls, defend themselves freely.
The complicity of murder may result in a detention of up to 5 years.
The suspect of the double murder of Ozd, a young man in his 23-year-old area, was placed in pre-trial detention on Sunday.
The counts against him are multiple homicides, committed with premeditation and interest.
During the investigation, it turned out that the 23-year-old man owed a large sum of money to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to settle his debt and that is why he attracted his creditor last Wednesday to a site in Ózd where he killed him, as well as that man's 9-year-old little girl.
According to information from the ITM, the young man premeditated his crime. The weapon with which he was going to commit his hidden crimes at the crime scene is proof of this.
The police examine the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the help of specialists.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange makes a proposal for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw stock exchange offered two hundred million euros, about five billion Czech krona, for the 100% repurchase of the Prague stock exchange package.
Ludwik Sobolowski, the president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed this proposal that the Polish made despite the fact that the Czechs had previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for this exclusion is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the State.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish State which wishes to separate more than 60% of its shares within a few months of its activities.
According to the Czech economic daily E15, the Polish proposal represents the highest offer that has so far been made for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna stock exchange, the Nasdaq transatlantic stock exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London stock exchange and the Deutsche Börse have made an offer to date.
Petr Koblic, the director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among the interested parties, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the least good new owner, and did not rule out the fact that this could lead to the disappearance of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague grant is estimated at between 5 to 10 billion Czech krona by market specialists.
On the basis of an agreement between shareholders, some 90% of the papers would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Patria Finance Investment Bank, with approximately 25 percent stakes, followed by the 14.7% of the Ceská Sporitelna Bank and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5%.
The financial crisis from the European press
In their comments on Tuesday on the international financial crisis, increasing from day to day, the leading newspapers of the European press are already referring to a "second September".
"The global financial disaster, we owe it to the American president" - accuses the daily newspaper of Rome, La Repubblica. "The president has not even been able to block with his own party a proposal for a law, improvised to va-vate, aimed at helping a desperate situation..."
Instead of a new Pearl Harbour, as recalled by the billionaire Warren Buffett, it is more appropriate to speak of a second September 11th.
Part of the Madrid press also sees the emissary village in Washington.
According to the daily view of El Mundo, it was the lack of political leadership there that brought the world economy to the brink of collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the American financial system increases every day, and then the whole world will pay the price for it.
Bush's plan was far from perfect, however, according to the vote of the congress, a real danger, the one that Washington does not propose a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy hangs in the void, just as in the history of capitalism, one of the greatest transformations takes place.
We can't ignore the threat any longer - highlights the Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva.
Some states may still have a bailout to their titubant financial agencies, and thanks to their taxpayers' money, they can save them from bankruptcy.
Of course, if even more banks collapse like dominoes, then neither financial resources nor new improvisations will be sufficient.
In the long term, we need the European Union's states to do little about their national selfishness and to centralise control over the divided financial markets.
Only Monday, the weak financial institutions received more than 100 billion euros - recalled the Viennese daily, Der Standard, which adds that fears that European taxpayers too will have to put their hands on the pocket, very deep, in a way similar to the Americans in order to remedy the crisis, are becoming increasingly realistic.
So far, the EU has not really dealt with the crisis, which, like a tsunami, runs through the old continent.
"Savers" should not immediately raise 100 billion euros, but it would be wise if they noticed in what case it would be rational to touch taxpayers' money, with the aim of preventing further damage.
The intelligent car imitates the flight of the bourdon
What method would be better for developing technologies capable of avoiding an obstacle, if not the imitation of an existing obstacle detector in nature?
Like, for example, bees.
In the amazing project presented at CEATEC, taking place in Japan, boudoning bees gave the strategic idea of starting engineers at Nissan, to inspire them on how they should design the next generation of obstacle detectors.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan built a mini robot, a bio-inspired auto-robotized control system, BR23C-type, which he equipped with bees' qualities, the ultimate goal being to encourage the development of a system capable of avoiding all obstacles.
On its flight, each bee is its own, oval-shaped space, which actually resembles much of our secure protection hull - explained, during the exhibition, Kazuhhiro Doi, the director of the research and development department and technological public relations of the brand.
The facet eye of the bee plays a vital role, as it is able to see in all directions, at an angle of 300 degrees.
In order to imitate the functions of the facet eye, the engineers discussed the idea of the laser telemeter.
It identifies the obstacles in an angle of 180 degrees and at a distance of 2 meters in front of the BR23C, evaluates the distances and sends a signal to the aboard microprocessor, which transforms it into avoidance maneuver immediately.
The perception of the obstacle takes place in a fraction of a second. Then, the mini robot, imitating the movements of the bee, immediately changes the direction of its wheels by turning it at an angle sufficient to avoid collision.
Contrary to any existing system, this avoidance manoeuvre is carried out in a whole instinctive way.
"If not, the mini robot could not react quickly enough to avoid the obstacle," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robotic car project.
It must react instinctively and instantaneously, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and most internal layer of the protective envelope, a layer where for the time being the collision is considered inevitable.
This whole process must reflect what bees do to avoid other bees.
The process must take place in a close eye.
Unlike bees, the difference cannot go up, down or diagonally, it can only be two dimensions, and only in the direction in which the wheels can turn.
In this way, instead of the infinite combinations that bees have to avoid other bees, in our case, only the rotational movement, acceleration and slowdown could be used as manoeuvres at the disposal of the mini robot
The BR23C uses polymer lithium batteries that are lighter and the energy concentration is higher, making their life span longer than in the lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, it is the smart instinctive reaction that is paramount, not data processing, and even less capacity to store.
This mechanism should only treat some incoming signals per second, and react to them.
It is not necessary to store them and react with intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers. In this way, it uses only a few dozen kilo-bytes of continuous memory.
There is no need for memory of a giga-bytes capacity, not even mega-bytes.
This is the first step towards the design of a technology for instant avoidance. According to Nissan's estimates, this system will make its way into the cars manufactured in series in the next ten years.
Another application could be its incorporation into the GPS satellite navigation system, so that it can guide the driver to his destination by avoiding obstacles on his way.
We even gave the baby a name out of price.
The written version of the $700 billion economic rescue plan, aimed at repurchase the bank's doubtful credits, and used several times, is ready.
In the first round, half of that amount will be spent.
Reuters announces that during further debates extending until after midnight, Saturday, local time on the east coast, Congressional leaders have agreed on the controversy that has existed for days and days around the rescue plan of a total of $700 billion.
"We have taken a serious step forward," said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic President of the U.S. House of Representatives, according to which there is nothing left to put the agreements on paper.
The compromise, born from the plan, is supported by the two presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson stated by commenting on the results of the compromise that the program will work and will be effective, but other measures still need to be implemented. According to Pelosi, there is no question here of saving Wall Street, but of turning the wheels of the economy in the other direction.
The written version of the plan was made public prior to the opening of the Asian markets, Sunday evening at 20h, Washington local time (i.e. Monday at 2h in the morning, according to Central Europe's local time), but did not cause spectacular increases in scholarships.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will be the first to vote on the proposed law on behalf of the 2008 Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, and then its fate will be in the hands of the Senate.
On Saturday evening, President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi, and then the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement.
"We are satisfied with the progress achieved tonight, and we strongly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and to protect our economy," said Tony Fratto, the spokesman for the White House.
In addition, the programme diverges from the initial proposal made by the Bush administration, which noted that the $700 billion had to be spent in one time, for the purchase of securities on doubtful credits.
At present, up to half of the sum of 700 billion can be spent. The first 250 billion will be issued immediately after the adoption of the law by Congress, probably Monday. This first amount will be used by the Treasury Secretary to purchase suspicious bank claims, while the use of the additional $100 billion will be left to the discretion of the President.
The programme will be supervised by an independent body, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The expenditure of the second half of the 700 billion depends on a new decree of Congress.
Under the Act, the Treasury secretariat will be able to establish a combined strategy: at the same time, it will be able to buy suspicious debts, securities related to suspicious mortgages and mortgages, as well as other types of "toxic" debts.
The department's competent persons stated that purchases may take place in the context of an auction sale, but also directly.
The rule gives the companies concerned the opportunity to participate in an insurance program, where the Treasury Secretariat guarantees the tools underlying the concerns, for which companies have paid a premium equivalent to the foreseeable damages.
Henry Paulson stated that the law provides the necessary tools to devote $700 billion for the urgent needs of the financial system, whether it is the vast repurchase of questionable claims, their insurance, or to avoid the risk of seeing the system causing the collapse of one or another important financial institution.
"We will take the necessary measures, to be ready to apply the law, as soon as it is signed," he added.
On the other hand, bank leaders in bad postures and waiting for state aid can expect that their departure allowances, simply called an overseas gold parachute, will be capped by the government.
The ceiling on wages is only mentioned in specific cases, and the limitations depend on how the Treasury Secretariat offers its company assistance.
The cap principle means that if the Treasury Secretariat buys back in a auction, they will collect a surplus of gold parachute tax unless the accredited bank president retires.
Directly after the purchase of suspicious debts, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the amount paid to leaders is not overstated.
For the image to be complete, it is still necessary to add that existing golden parachutes are not modified. The ceiling only concerns new contracts, thus motivating participation in the plan.
This is the first time in the history of the United States that legal ceilings will be in force regarding the appointment of directors general - commented the chairman of the Board of Directors responsible for the financial benefits of the Chamber of Deputies, Democrat Barney Frank.
In addition, the State is granted a right to acquire shares in banks taking part in the plan, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, since they may even be winning in the case as soon as the economy and with it the banks saved will fall on their feet.
The bill states that in the next five years, the President must introduce a proposal to Congress which will decide how the losses will be returned to taxpayers from the financial sector.
On both sides, there were, of course, those who expressed their doubts about this plan.
That's not why American citizens have sent us, this does not protect taxpayers' dollars - said California's Republican MP Darrell Issa.
His Democratic colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, thinks it is the same people who are pressing for action, than those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices have continued to rise

The higher prices of plastic and chemical raw materials resulted in a considerable monthly increase in the prices of the manufacturing sector of chemicals and products (1.6 per cent).
This resulted in deflation in the oil processing sectors (1.4 per cent), the manufacture of electrical machinery and apparatus (0.9 per cent), as well as a minimum increase in the wood processing sector (0.1 per cent).
The prices of paper production, publishing and printing have not changed.
The other sectors of the processing industry have increased from 0.2 per cent to 0.9 per cent.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors, which represent a significant weight in the national industrial operation, prices increased by 0.3 per cent in August, mainly due to the effect of the increase in the gas price established by the authorities since 1 July.
In a 12-month comparison, taking into account the domestic sales of the processing sectors, the prices of the oil processing sector have increased most significantly (32.4 per cent).
In the metal manufacturing sector, prices rose by 13.2 per cent, while prices rose by 11 per cent in the major area of food, beverages and tobacco production.
Price reductions were made in the textile and textile production sectors (2.5 per cent), as well as in the manufacture of machinery and electrical appliances (0.3 per cent).

In the consumer goods production sectors, prices increased by 0.3 per cent, while those in the energy and materials sectors intended for subsequent processing did not change compared to the previous month.
In August 2008, compared to the same month of the previous year, the largest increase in energy production and materials for subsequent processing (16.8 per cent) was observed.
In consumer goods production, 6.8 per cent inflation was measured, while for profit-initiating sectors, a 1.4 per cent decrease was measured.

In one month, our national means of payment fell by 1.7 per cent compared to the euro and 7.1 per cent compared to the dollar. Compared to August 2007, it increased by 7.5 per cent compared to the euro and 15.9 per cent compared to the dollar.
Next year, will we still need a visa to go to the United States?
Kinga Göncz believes that there is a good chance that by January 12, the American-Hungarian visa-free agreement will enter into force. That is what the Minister of Foreign Affairs told Chicago, before the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
According to her, "now everything depends only on the time when the overseas electronic input and control systems will be put into operation."
On occasion, she drew attention to the fact that in the new system there will be no entry visa, but tourists will have to register before departure.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy will be in negotiations from today in Washington.
He will meet the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Condoleezza Rice, to whom he will give the decoration of the Commander Cross with the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary Star, and will have an interview with the Foreign Policy Advisors of the presidential candidates, Democratic Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain both support the bank rescue plan
On Sunday, Barack Obama as well as John McCain, the candidates for the presidency of the two major U.S. parties, assured their support of the government's 700 billion-dollar rescue plan. However, there are politicians who demand the resignation of the U.S. secretary from the Treasury.
After marathon negotiations that lasted days and days, representatives of Congress and the Administration finally announced on Sunday at dawn that they had reached agreement in principle on bank rescue.
This funding plan, with the aim of freezing the Wall Street crisis and the paralysed credit market, became the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain even present themselves, each as more suitable than the other, to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, with the emphasis on economic issues, Obama has again succeeded in obtaining a little advance. McCain's advance, obtained with Sarah Palin's appointment as a schoolgirl just after the Republican convention, has founded.
At a campaign meeting held in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress would vote quickly on the 700 billion rescue law.
He stressed that the proposal contains the consumer protection passages that he also supports.
"It is now necessary to act with responsibility (...) a danger threatens your work, your economies, the entire industrial sectors and the stability of the entire economy" - he said before a crowd of 35,000 people.
He did not fail to qualify McCain's economic ideas as outdated.
In an interview to the ABC channel, McCain said: "We will all have trouble swallowing it ... but doing nothing is not a possible way."
The Republican Senator stated that the proposal mentions the establishment of a Treasury Control Board and the ceiling of departure allowances for senior officials, and that it was, personally, very attached to these points.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no substantive role in the negotiations, while he was in daily contact with the Treasury Secretary.
Nancy Pelosi, president of the House of Representatives, said Sunday that there are serious hopes that the House will vote on the bill on Monday.
The press review of the German language territory
The right camp is intact, it is only in the heart of the party that voters have become more aware - this is how Der Spiegel, the low score of the CSU in the Bavarian country, evokes.
Haider is ready to rule Austria, to prevent the coalition of red and blacks.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the Internet edition of the German left-wing news magazine, Franz Walter analyzes the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article entitled "The Revolution in Bavaria devours his fathers".
According to this recognized politician, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took office.
Christian socialists have transformed Bavaria for decades and now it is these same modern citizens who turn their backs on them.
This change of time is at the same time the problem of all Christian democracy, and therefore also that of Angela Merker.
For the CSU, failure was not quite a surprise, but on Sunday, a process came to an end that was likely to happen ten years ago: the undisputed hegemony of the national party ended.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU gathered with 47.7 per cent, for the first time since the 1950s, with a score below the level of 50 per cent.
This was repeated three years ago during the 2005 Bundestag elections, that is, at the time of the so-called Stoiber.
The cause can be attributed to the modernization "devoting its parents", set up in the region consistently by the CSU.
It has been 40 years since sociologists announced this but strongly wronged about the pace. However, secularization, educational results and the establishment of Germans from the north and east in the developing Bavarian region could not remain without consequence on the loyalty of CSU voters.
Modernisation goes hand in hand with increasing opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also visible.
The right camp is intact, it is only within the party that voters have become more conscious, more critical and more stubborn.
It is also surprising that in recent weeks it is precisely the groups of classical citizens who have moved away from the CSU, such as the independents, artisans, the holders of the bac and the graduates of higher education.
In these groups, support for the CSU decreased by under 40 percent.
Die Presse (depresse.com)
In his article entitled "Who ? With whom ? Party presidents stand on the reserve in the face of coalition issues", the conservative Austrian daily deals with the situation of the confused domestic policy that settled after the Austrian elections.
The Austrian Socialists of SPÖ want to discuss with the Conservatives of ÖVP.
ÖVP prohibits SPÖ from interfering with its internal affairs.
The BZÖ populist party is open for negotiations. Greens still do not want to agree on the coalition.
The elections took place, now everything revolves around the coalition; during the debates held on public television, party leaders barely let their cards appear.
Werner Faymann, President of SPÖ, confirmed that he wished to discuss with ÖVP.
SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is indeed possible - that is what already exists in some regions and in the socialist partnership.
The question that he would imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current President of ÖVP, as Vice Chancellor, remains open on behalf of Faymann.
As he mentioned, the Schüssel-Molterer orientation was, in any case, rejected.
A replica of this combination is out of the question.
Molterer responded with caution to red proposals.
As he has already said, collaboration will certainly fail if Faymann tries to get involved in ÖVP's internal affairs.
In its party, the choice of opposition or entry into the coalition is currently an entirely open matter, and these points must be discussed in the ÖVP.
Jörg Haider, President of the BZÖ, is once again open to all proposals.
"To avoid the coalition of reds and blacks, we are ready to assume government responsibilities," Haider said.
Járóka said: We must break the vicious circle of poverty and segregation
Today, in Paris, the European Summit for Equal Opportunities began, the host of which is France, as representative of the current Presidency of the European Union.
In his message before the plenary, as one of the main spokespersons of the expert consultation, Lívia Járóka, MEP Fides European People's Party, drew attention to segregation in education, because it is a violation of the law that affects Roma children most and thus one of the main obstacles to their success in life.
On behalf of the French Presidency, this high-level conference was opened by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, and by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Labour, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among those invited to participate in the consultation are the European social partners, as well as the most prominent representatives of legal protection and European civil bodies, in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the Group of MP Fides People's Party, Járóka warned that, alongside the distinctions found during hirings, the Roma disappear from the labour market, first of all, as a result of their low qualifications.
"A overwhelming majority of young Roma do not have high school degrees, and as a result of poor elementary education, only a small part has the possibility of obtaining a higher education degree."
Járóka also stressed that education as a basic human right plays a key role when advocating other fundamental rights.
Investment in early education for Roma children means strengthening the economy of the EU member countries.
According to the Member of the European Parliament, it is necessary to raise awareness of these relations in the widest possible circle, also between Roma and non-Roms.
Indeed, the earlier a Roma child begins school, the more he increases his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; by taxes paid from his income and consumption, he participates in the state budget.
"By virtue of their European Union nationality, Roma must be guaranteed their right to quality education, and protected from low quality and sectarian education." - stressed Lívia Járóka.
According to the honourable Member, cooperation from the European Union aimed at an objective and action is necessary for an immediate acceleration of the process of disintegration of schools, so compliance with existing anti-discrimination directives and in preparation is of paramount importance.
"We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and joblessness. We must give the opportunities provided by democracy to Roma children, so that they can participate as full citizens in the future of Europe" - Járóka demanded.
On behalf of the "European Year for Equal Opportunities" for all, the aim of the Summit for Equal Opportunities in Europe held every year since the Berlin Summit last year is to provide a single platform to support measures taken to promote equality of opportunity and to combat discrimination at European and Member States level.
CSU: grace for a transitional period
The decision on the fate of the duo Huber-Beckstein will be taken in October
Despite this pitiful electoral failure, the heads have not yet fallen, and the debate on personal issues at the summits of the Bavarian CSU has been adjourned.
The president of the party, Erwin Hube and the head of the regional government, Günther Beckstein, can still keep their place. The question is how long will grace last?
The fate of the tandem, having suffered a catastrophic loss of voice of 17 per cent, will be on the agenda of the congress of the exceptional party, held on the last weekend of October.
In any event, members of this highly criticized pair felt that they did not hold specifically to their seats.
As a result, they worked to calm the angry members of the fraction and base, who one day after the "tsunami Bavarian" demanded personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - it is true, still under the direction of Edmund Stoiber, at the top of his career - the socio-Christian union won 60.7 percent, while today, one year after the putsch against Stoiber, only 43.4 percent of their strength remains.
For 46 years, the CSU was the "only sovereign" of Bavaria giving 18 percent of German GDP.
But conservatives are still heavily involved in this southern region, which is of key importance to the Hungarian economy. In the future, they will be forced into the coalition.
As one of the first signs of internal reform of the party, the Vice-President and Federal Minister of Agriculture, Horst Seehofer, presented as Huber's possible successor, also received a place in this modest recognition group, which initiates discussions with the FDP Liberals, as well as with the Free Electors, formed along the right-wing values, about a possible coalition of the Munich government.
A strange nose of fate was that with the help of the Free Electors list, Gabriele Pauli entered the legislation, whose measurement against Stroiber served as a possibility of putsch perpetrated by the Huber-Beckstein duo, and then without modification the very ambitious municipal political woman.
Now, the leaders of the CSU are putting all their energy to stabilize, in one way or another, Beckstein.
In this transition, Stoiber, who so far pulled the wires behind the scenes, will also receive an active role. The former head of the regional government and former president of the CSU, appointed September 28 as the most bitter day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber launched some sharp remarks to the CDU. According to him, they would have deserved much more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as a warning for the CDU and also for Angela Merkel.
Following the Bundestag elections, which will take place in September 2009, Merkel will once again be a chance only if they re-establish in one way or another, with a common force, the CSU, having played an important role in the national success of 2005.
According to Merkel, hiding his disappointment caused by fiasco, the land loss of the CSU will not adversely affect the large Berlin coalition.
This is relative, however, because it will not be easier to manage the injured CSU, and the socio-democratic crisis still lasts.
Since 1946, the SPD has achieved its worst results with 18.6 per cent in Bavaria.
Lukasenko - its rivals : 110 - 0
No member of the opposition acceded to the Belarusian parliament after the Sunday elections.
According to the Russian observers, this is explained by a country led by Alexandre Lukashenko, which provides him with prosperity and stability, while according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained by illegal voting.
The OSCE, having sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the elections.
Although the legislation composed of 110 people in that country of 10 million people has been going very well for decades, before the elections yesterday, the opposition joining its forces under the name of the United Nations Democratic Forces (ODSZ) seriously hoped that Lukashenko, renewing his term as president for the fourth time in questionable elections, on the traces of the amendment of the constitution in 2006, would "allow" this time the presence of a few MPs of the opposition to parliament.
In this way, the ODSZ gave up its original boycott.
The fact that Belarus, which is increasingly economically dependent on Russia, would like to improve its relations with the EU, where because of the Belarusian political order as anti-democratic, Lukashenko and several senior politicians do not receive entry visas, was one of the expectations of the opposition. Belarus had to take credit for decreasing imports of Russian natural gas, which was increasingly expensive, and thus contributed to the passage of Beltransgaz, owner of gas pipelines across the country, to the hands of the Russians.
The fact that the OSCE, in the evaluation of the campaign, focused on positive changes rather than on shortcomings, such as the prohibition of one third of candidates for opposition, referred to a pre-arrangement.
However, the OSCE communiqué of Monday already challenged the campaign, during which most opposition candidates could not appear in the media, particularly the fact that the opposition could not be present during the vote.
Despite all this, the opposition still sees tangible improvement in the political regime: political prisoners have regained their freedom, and Minsk is ready for small confrontations with Moscow, still refusing to recognize South Ossetia and Abazia separated from Georgia. However, Russia with which Belarus forms a confederation on paper, has considered the two independent territories for a month.
"We have taken two steps forward, and one step backwards, but the most important thing is that the dialogue has been started between Belarus and the EU," Alexandre Milinkevitch told our newspaper.
According to the candidate for opposition to the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable that this remain, although "the power was afraid in this parliament which has no weight, to bring even one opponent in".
The opposition does not provide for action to protest against the results; rather, it seeks to convey its message on the need for economic reforms to voters.
"Of course, we have a lot of concerns on this side: we have to get our opposing newspapers printed in Russia, the local authorities are putting us on wheels with regard to broadcasting, but I can also see that they are increasingly supporting the elections, even in the old people's circle," said Milinkevitch, referring to the fact that in the current Lukashenko regime, which considers social security as its main result, the layer of the most officially supported retirees no longer considers it appropriate.
"Because of the country's debt and the increase in the trade deficit, the collapse of social security, 'revoking the silence of a cemetery', is no longer a matter of time" - Milinkevitch estimates.
Unlike the opposition politician, the Russian observers described the democratic elections.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian press agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words, but in acts." Thus, the absence of the opposition is only proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From today, breakfast before work".
Never, in the history of the Chigi Palace, we had no turning doors for the entrance and exit of the employees.
But from now on, this new measure against the clever little ones is in force, against which he points and then drinks coffee at the bar during the hours of work.
Today, the new anti-fairners were presented by the Minister of Public Administration Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"The turning doors," said Brunetta, "are a tool for better working, with more productivity, more presence and more services," said the Minister.
Now begins a new season of responsibility and transparency.
"It's reformism," Brunetta added.
The installation in all institutions of the Presidency of the Council is complete with the Chigi Palace.
According to Masi, "the choice of rotating doors is important even from a symbolic point of view.
There was no resistance on the part of the employees, the Secretary General said: "It is a process shared by the employees, and we have had the cooperation of all."
In short, more breakfast during working hours; more coffee or growing.
Brunetta's promise, which suggests smiling, "a good cappuccino at 7am is an excellent and safe resolution".
At a conference at the Higher School of Public Administration
in Rome, the minister informs that "in three months, the absence of public employees' disease has declined by 50%, or 60 thousand workers more than a year".
And he adds that it is essential to make the Public Administration more effective.
Italian, "including wage dynamics," explains the Minister. "The last 8-10 years have doubled compared to the private sector, and much more than inflation rates.
At the same time, thousands of public employees joined together to challenge the standards of the Brunetta decree using the Codacons.
"while the Minister of the Public Service is now detailing the data on the decline in absenteeism in the workplace due to illness - the association of consumers - the people of "active farmers" continues to increase.
In Italy, thousands of correct and productive Public Administration employees gathered to declare war to the illegitimate standards contained in the decree.
In particular, the Tar is challenged by the exclusion of additional allowances in case of disability due to service; the extension of the hours of stay of the sick worker's home, during which inspection visits are carried out, as well as other aspects contained in the new provisions required by the Minister.
Accidents at the workplace, Napolitano: "Criminal prevention"
Every day in Italy there are 2,500 work accidents, 3 dead and 27 persons who remain permanently disabled.
In 2007 the Inail data confirmed that white deaths were approximately 1,200.
Figures that show the severity of the phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of death, and cause almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
To get the attention of institutions, social forces and media on this dramatic aspect, the Angel celebrates today, in all Italian provinces, the 58th National Day of Accidents at Work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The disturbing data broadcast by Anmil, as well as the tragic events of recent days, confirm the importance of the topic of prevention at the workplace," said the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, in a message sent to the President of Anmil, National Association of Mutilates and Invalid workers, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his sincere appreciation for the ongoing associative effort to prevent workplaces, the protection of injured workers, assistance to victims' families and public awareness."
"Of course outraged, everyone has hit a punch to put an end to such tragedies which, by their size, provoke the clamor of the media and the participation of the public, even though the daily reality presents us with dramatic, even repetitive cases in their dynamics.
Napolitano does not hide that there is certainly a resource problem: it is essential to invest in training and information.
The many initiatives promoted in the school sector are of particular importance for a more direct awareness on the part of young people entering the world of work.
It is our duty, to maintain attention to this phenomenon, not to assess the alarm on social gravity, to apply and improve legislative standards.
For his part, the president of the Gianfranco Fini House has stressed how "the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which insults the conscience of each of us, and requires all institutions to make a concrete effort to put an end to it quickly".
The accident data at work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not prevent the number of white deaths is still impressive" later pointed out the president of the Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
"We do not want this "downward trend" to translate in fact into a minor attention, because it is just when the attention is relaxed, that tragedy comes.
"we believe that in general, we do not do enough to contrast the accident phenomenon and the contrast can be made through multiple actions."
"We have pointed out that Mercandelli-more controls and inspections are necessary, as well as a more important intervention on the training of workers, and this, from school."
He added that further efforts should be made to communicate and raise public awareness.
"But above all, a greater sense of employers' responsibilities towards a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
"Mandandelli then denounced "the gradual deterioration of the conditions for the protection of workers' benefits" and "the drift of assistance towards which the system has been oriented in recent years".
"The aim, therefore, is to give the worker the insurance guarantee – he added – so that the destiny of the person having an accident should not depend on the spontaneity or enlargement of the legislator"
Mp3 reader pointed at the finger, they put the hearing at risk.
Listen to full volume music for an extended period using portable music devices such as Mp3 players can cause permanent damage to the hearing.
This is announced by the European Commission, which, in a communiqué published in Brussels, cites the Scientific Committee's opinion on the unexpected and recently identified health risks (Csseri) of the EU published today.
"of this scientific report - let us read in the note - it appears that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least five years, listen to full volume music using portable musical devices, for more than one hour per day and per week, risk permanent loss of hearing capacity."
"I am concerned that such an important number of young people who frequently use portable music and full-volume mobile phones can unconsciously damage their hearing in an irreparable way," Meglena Kuneva says.
"Scientificly, according to scientific data, the EU is still at a clear risk and we need to react quickly.
What counts most is to raise consumer awareness and make this public information.
We must also review existing control systems in view of scientific opinion so that they are fully effective and can follow new technologies."
Brussels asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the intensive use of portable musical devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise generated by them.
"Scientifics-conclude the executive EU- confirm that there are good reasons to be concerned, and that the European Commission will now examine with the Member States and other interested parties what measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and adolescents against exposure to noise from portable music devices and similar devices.
There is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable music devices to 100Db, but concern increases as to the auditory damage that could result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to limit these data using solutions such as reducing noise levels and duration of exposure.
The Scientific Committee notes that users of portable music devices, who listen to full volume music (more than 89 decibels) for 5 hours per week, exceed the current limits on the maximum noise level at the workplace.
Those who listen to music under such conditions during extended periods risk permanent loss of hearing capacity after 5 years.
This affects 5-10% of users of these devices, and their number can be quantified to approximately 2.5 and 10 million people in the U.S.
Rome, Germano has ordered the Commission to leave for the future of the capital.
Today we begin, in March we end, in June we will draw the sums.
This is the timetable set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capital", which took place this morning at the new headquarters behind the Therms of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will develop the directives for Rome.
In March, when completed, the Committee and the Council will evaluate the analyses and projects, so as to present in June the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official stamp " of the Capitol and its Mayor Gianni Germano.
"The Commission is absolutely independent; all political, social and cultural ideas are represented there," she said. "She should propose ideas for the development of Rome to be used by the political decision makers, who remain the Committee and the Council.
No superposition of roles, but only the will to have a corner to develop a great project for Rome.
In March, it will have completed its tasks and will then disappear, as this experience must have a precise temporal duration.
In June- announces the mayor- we will present the strategic plan resulting from the work carried out by the Commission for the Future of Rome Capital."
For those who accuse the Commission of being unnecessary, since its views will not be binding, Germano replies: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and on the quality of its proposals.
If quality is there, as in France thanks to the Attali Commission, as in Rome, I am sure its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics is overwhelmed by day-to-day management and emergencies that manifest themselves from time to time.
On the contrary, we want to see forward, and beyond, towards a deeper perspective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future."
In addition, the Mayor of Rome wishes to stress that "this Commission is not a useless body or a bureaucratic set: it is absolutely free, and will not cost the Roman city citizens a euro, and will serve to study and involve the best intelligences that express the Capital.
For Germano, in fact, "we need a draft of strategic reference, neither firm nor immovable, in order to allow our city to improve, what it absolutely needs, while thinking of its future now a unitary spirit."
A future that, according to the Mayor of Rome, "will not be limited to the usual communal borders, but will look further" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as Capital, but also in relation to the role that Rome can and must have, as Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? The first anti-American president. That's why.
A famous American politician who wants to become an independent politician wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, on the part of his decisions, destroyed the US economy and had relations (as he still has today, as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam."
Attacks on Obama are increasing as the election date approaches.
A Miami lady wrote on a website: "This person is full of ambition".
Obama is really polite: he believes that he will be the highest function of a nation that counts at all, two governors and five black senators!"
In fact, they are attacks that do not say much; they are of course racial attacks, and they do not answer the question of all voters: will he be a good president? We also have the polls, who all declare that Obama will win and with a good advantage.
In this case, it's still someone who talks with the heart and not with the brain.
A newspaper from the Mississippi, in the inner parts of the southern United States, wrote an article: once in the polling station, we know who the American patriot will vote for.
This is what emerges an aspect of American mentality kept secret until the end.
"Tell me what you want, we'll see ourselves putting the cross on Obama or McCain.
There are even people who swear: if Obama wins, we will leave the United States.
Things never revealed so far, to such an extent that the success of the black candidate seems almost certain.
However, despite all these reasonings, the winning card for Democrats is George Bush.
We asked 1500 people: what were Bush's mistakes during his term of office? 89 percent answered: Iraq.
America changes.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50 miles of soldiers and was sent back to her home on foot.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers lost their lives, and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Despite this, Iraq has, for the most part, been Bush's weakness.
Who will take the place of George W will have a huge spot to fulfill.
Usa, the economic breakdown is felt even among journalists: in the press, it's time for suppression. And many accuse the Internet, this "murder" of newspaper paper.
Five hundred American journalists were interviewed by the PEW Research Center on the status of their profession and mental control for the future.
Well, almost all journalists are today pessimistic about their future.
However, they did not openly declare themselves concerned about credibility to the information attachees.
They don't feel isolated like they used to be.
The problem with American journalists is money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of a destroyed economic model.
In addition, the deletions made in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work in the assembling of newspapers, are a major problem.
It is a problem that needs to be resolved, according to the journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism, as the general public hears it, is not significantly reduced.
An obvious but complex pessimism invades American journalism.
Six out of ten senior executives and press journalists are convinced that journalism at the national level is following a bad path.
Locally, the executive group is 65%.
Published against broadcast.
Journalists don't have a hard time seeing where the web is going.
The largest publishing houses are passing to the Internet, perceived by many as "the killer" of the newspaper paper.
The "economic pressure" that journalists feel is increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted to technology hoping that it would "do something good" for their journalism.
Today, the biggest acroc in American journalism lies between those who run the newsrooms - i.e. the directors - and the reporters who work for them.
56% of directors at the national level are convinced that reporters share their values, while at the local level, this percentage falls to 23%.
For some, this is related to "work safety".
Directors who are planning to lose their jobs in 3 years are 47% at the national level.
As far as journalists are concerned, we're going to 30%.
The "safe work" at the staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is still on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In an immense nation such as the Usa, with 300 million people and thousands of journalists, magazines, radio, television and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, and it becomes quickly a matter of taking or leaving.
Directors receive almost always large salaries, while the editor can earn $10 thousand a month, in addition to retirement and insurance payments.
As for holidays, logic becomes complicated: x days after the first year, x days after the third, up to 15 days in whole, past a number of years.
But, according to their revelations, American journalists are often "diseased" during the year.
It's the fault of the climate.
UNIPOL:TRIBUNAL ROME, DANILO COPPOLA IS STILL GROTTAFERRATA.
The president of the second criminal section of the Court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the instance of the real estate agent Danilo Coppola, who had asked to be allowed to leave his city, Grottaferrata, for a dwelling in Rome.
. Coppola is investigated for the highway as part of the Unipol-Bnl climbing instruction.
During his trial last week, he had been released into compulsory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estate agent be able to travel the city of province to a housing in the capital.
According to the court, such travel (which the PM did not grant) would allow it to influence its company and to have access to the evidence that accuses it.
The elites are in danger.
The phenomenon had already appeared a few days ago, with the vote of the House of Representatives, contrary to the $700 billion rescue plan approved by the White House: a significant number of Americans were, and still more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the American economy.
And it is the New York Times yesterday that confirms it by communicating that the current crisis divides the Republican Party, even more divided between its early East Coast soul, moderate, favourable to federal institutions as well as to business community, and its new soul, rather conservative, hostile to "the Washingtons" and the world of finance, which is especially powerful in the Central and South states.
The soul, precisely, which became despotic with the vote I was speaking to you at the beginning.
However, what has just been mentioned is just one example of the changes, the major changes that the current economic earthquake has announced or already leaves to run: not only to the United States, but throughout the West, and may not be just here.
In the United States as well as in Europe, the crisis seems to speed up the phenomena that have been occurring for some time, to such an extent that, in the new climate, they are solidified and revealed.
The first of these phenomena is the renewal, the extraordinary revival, of the dual sovereign state category, compared to a kind of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking-financial institutions that obviously have close relations with the foreign country, but which, above all, are involved on a large scale, the balance sheets of individuals and families living in one country, in one state.
This creates an immediate political problem for those who govern it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of individuals and families who are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears economically global but politically, it is almost only here national.
Political internationalisation seems really out of play, or not much to say: the obvious evidence is provided by the European Union, which, as usual, between the various interests and the various national strategies, does not come to a decision on a common political line.
And so, it is from the government of each state that everyone expects interventions, rescue and recovery plans, new rules, and above all a credit condition: when we go through a difficult period, there are only the states that have the economic resources, the mass of financial resources that can try to put things back in place.
They also have the necessary means and legitimacy to use them: two resources of invaluable value, elements that no international market or organization can ever have in a similar manner.
This new emphasis on the state-of-the-nation crisis is, of course, in perfect harmony with the ever greater importance that recent economic developments in the economy tend to attribute to a fairly related factor: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we were now entering the realm of the network, of increasingly sophisticated technology, of non-material, convinced that globalized finance was now destined to dominate the world, we realized at once that our future will need to settle its accounts more and more with things that are not material, such as water, crops, oil.
Things that can certainly be transported from one place to another from the earth, but which are absolutely linked to a confined space, to a territory.
Thus, who is sovereign, certainly has more maps than the one who is not, that is, the one who has the misfortune to live in a place without harvest, without oil and without water.
I now come to the second novelty which, however, foresees a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably said Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective need for authoritarian leadership, the search for a person who knows how to take over the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leaderships, economic species that have proved inadequate and full of shadows.
And moreover, something even deeper, in a certain sense, even worrying: a discredit, a suffering, an image of inadequacy, a feeling of remoteness that tends to involve the entire class of directors in an increasing number of Western countries.
This further increases the conviction of the various classes, before the actions are the same ideas of the social elites until now at their peak, their way of listening and being, their culture in the complex acceptance of the term, to have the same time, and to be ever more foreign to the opinions of the majority.
In short, The demand for leadership, in an underground way, feeds a powerful and ramified movement of delegitimizations of the ruling classes and traditional political orders, which manifest themselves in the improvised electoral "revolts" or, in the changes of collective moods of the latter recently, from the conservative rise in Austria Bavaria, to the fall of the workers in Britain, to the rebellion of the American congressmen against Bush (and it might well be that the victory of the right in Italy did not come by chance).
It is felt that traditional elites, their parties, their programs, as well as their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format, someone seems to have ever more difficulty, which does not date today, to understand and therefore to represent the deep layers of Western societies, and that the economic crisis strengthens, increases and potentially shakes in a disproportionate manner.
In view of all this, speaking of a current "rebellion of the masses" on the agenda seems frankly exaggerated.
But we say well, keep your eyes wide open, that's not for no reason.
The super collar to walk on the walls.
Break the laws of gravity through a super glue and, in the future, walk on the walls like Spiderman.
This is the goal of various American research centres, and today a team of four institutes has almost succeeded.
With an adhesive measuring barely 2.5 square inches, the researchers managed to hold a body of 100 kilograms on a vertical wall.
The Study- The American journal Science published the findings of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material, invented by the team of researchers, is an evolution of those we know who use a particular structure of carbon, called carbon nano tubes.
"The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged as a pile of spaghetti." Explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology of Atlanta.
Scientists have inspired themselves from the legs of geckos, covered with microscopic hairs that ensure the animal, a perfect adherent.
Tests on various materials, such as glass, Teflon, and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the feet of these reptiles, and at the same time, that it "is easily detached from the wall," explains Liming Dai, researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
MARKING ON MURS? –"this material could be used as a temporary adhesive" added Liming Dai.
Can it be to walk on the walls like Spiderman? Perhaps so, but researchers think of much less fascinating use such as the connection between electronic devices, since carbon nano tubes are drivers of heat and electrical current.
Other applications could be related to aerospace engineering.
For now, no superhero.
THE OTHER RESEARCH- Berkeley University, California, is also looking for a new adhesive.
In an article by the American Chemical Society, Californian researchers presented an adhesive made up of microfibre like hair, which self-cleanses dust during the movement on a surface to ensure perfect and constant adherence.
Medicines: never with fruit juice.
Attention to grapefruit juice, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed mainly in the summer because they are desalient and rich in vitamins, if associated with certain vital drugs, alter their amplifying or decreasing absorption as appropriate, their effectiveness, with even serious health consequences.
David Nayley, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, recalls the risks of fruit juice, whether in box or fresh, if associated with the ingestion of certain medicines; during the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he launched a new alarm: enough of grapefruit juice, orange and apple juice, to reduce the absorption of certain vital drugs, undoing their beneficial effects and endangering the health of patients.
grapefruit juice has already been strongly criticised as it has been held responsible for increasing the effects of certain anti-arythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, anti-stantal and neurological drugs up to toxic levels.
Medicinal Products A RISK- The Italian Medicines Agency itself, which reported in a two-year information bulletin, alerts doctors and patients not to assess the danger arising from this mixture and to be careful about drinking, taking medicines such as Diazepam or Methadone.
NOT THE PAMPLEMOUSSE- According to experts, even orange and apple juice contains substances that inhibit medicines.
Long is the list of active substances inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
From there, the appeal of Michele Carruba, director of the Department of Pharmacology of the Public University of Milan: "These discoveries are generally, immediately reported to the various national and international drug agencies that will need to change the information notes of the drugs.
It is always necessary to read the illustrative papers of the medicines taken, and, if something is not clear, not to be impressed, but to speak clearly to the doctor or pharmacist," said the expert at the Ansa Agency.
The Nobel Prize in Economics in Paul Krugman.
The Nobel Prize for Economics was awarded to American Paul Krugman for his research on business models and on the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a New Kenyan who teaches at the University of Princeton and is also a famous editor of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest criticisms of the Bush administration's foreign economic and political solutions.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, during the days of Enron's bankruptcy, Krugman had written, in an article published on the New York Times, that the second event would have been more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on the history of the United States.
A forecast that triggered many controversy, which was reproached by the economist for years, but has now proved to be correct.
"I am surprised and even a little shocked at the speed with which the memory of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom has disappeared from public attention," said Krugman at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "high-value economist", but also a very aggressive "stylist", particularly critical of the excess liberalism of the Bush administration.
Open Office, this is the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package.
It is the day of the broadcast of OpenOffice.org.3.0, the open source of personal productivity that aims to always and even more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, offering a free alternative to the most famous Microsoft Office.
As a result of nearly a year's work, carried out by volunteer developers, monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office package shows itself to the general public with various innovations: from the welcome screen, and the interface reviewed and became less austere, to more important ones, such as compatibility born for the Apple Mac OS X operating system, and support for the new ODF format (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest ISO standard version.
Open Office has paid particular attention to the interaction with the Office 2007 suite and it is possible to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx.)
Also interesting, certain functions specific to certain modules, such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example, to send them by e-mail, or to import PDF files into the graphics development module, preserving the original aspect of the page.
Still on this front, it is possible to create "Hybrid PDF" documents that combine the typical Adobe graphic with elements of a spreadsheet or text maker.
Collaboration between several people is an element that has had various improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet, various users can intervene, avoiding conflict on changes, in the drafting of texts, because each employee is assigned a color of comments for better recognition in the revision phase.
Some companies are even working to bring some OpenOffice functions on the Web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks, they should deliver the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.htmlet and is added to the English version on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the suite is as usual available also for the Linux operating system.
Upon request, the installation code may be shipped at home or at the workplace.
And if the theme of gratuitousness can be a means of spreading it into the homes, it is precisely in the business, that Open Office then tries the big challenge, which can already count on various projects carried out in the public administration and schools.
Apart from the realities that offer a training, consultation and assistance service, ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could also open up to business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for Word equivalent writing video; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for PowerPoint rival presentations;Dbase, such as the famous Access, is the program that allows you to work on databases; finally Drwa is the graphical module.
Target for 2008, reaching 5 million downloads, and considering that today there are almost 3 million and 600 miles, it is likely that with the release of the new version, we can even exceed the expected figure
Kohl too, is positive, this is the fourth case of doping.
New case of positivity at the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian of the Gerolsteiner team, Bernhard Kohl, qualified third, and winner of the best climber's jersey.
This is the daily website L'Equipe that reports the news.
At 26 years old, Kohl is the fourth positive cyclist in the Cera, the third generation Epo, after the Italians Riccardo Riccó and Leonardo Piepoli, and German Stefan Schumacher, also from Gerolsteiner.
Blood tests performed on Kohl testes are part of those carried out in recent weeks by laboratories in Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-analysis confirms the positivity in Cera, the Austrian will lose its third place in the Tour and will have to wait two years for elimination.
The news of Kohl's positivity at the third generation Epo, was confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who communicated to the Associated Press, had notified the Austrian authorities of the positivity.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed himself on the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, thus rubbing the best climber's peas shirt.
IMMIGERS: NEW YORK TIMES ASKING IF ITALY IS RACIST?
Italy "as a country of emigrants has recently become a preferred destination for immigrants" welcomed reluctantly.
Would this turn the beautiful country into a nation of racists? That's what the New York Times is about, who dedicated a long article discussing the theme of racism in Italy, starting with the case of young Abdul William Guibre, from Burkina Faso, who was killed last month in Milan, for stealing a box of biscuits.
This case highlights what the New York Times defines as the "northern paradox": the Nordic regions are both those where we register" more integration and more work", but also" an anti-immigrant feeling the country's strongest and most important support for the Northern Lega"
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, NYT also referred to the episodes of intolerance of Milan, Parme, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only.
Even the new legislature required by the Lega to curb immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegals is cited as evidence of climate change in Italy.
Tendency underlined by the Pope as well as by the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano during his meeting with Benedict XVI in Quirinal, asked that the State and the Church work together to overcome racism."
Student victims of expensive rents, up to 900 euros for one room.
The student rental market has no crisis
According to Sunia's latest survey, the tenants' union, renting a single room can cost a student, up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now reached very serious aspects to the exclusion of entire categories of young people, from the right to study due to the very high overall costs that families of origin must support," explains the head of the study office in Sunia, Laura Mariani- in these cities, the high demand of students has distorted the market so much that a generalized increase process has even begun for residents.
In most cases, rental offers also include a series of violations: free-type contracts, not registered, without rent limit, sub-locations.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions through the tax revision are necessary to calm prices.
When we look at the survey in detail, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, it takes about 450 euros; for a single room, we have to go from 650 euros minimum (Black Strip area), to an average value of 800 (Lambate, Udine, and Fiera area) to a maximum of 900 euros (Vittoria area)
In Florence, an average bed costs 350/400 euros, one room approximately 700 euros.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in the nearby areas of the University, it takes 250/280 euros for a bed in a double, and from 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, in the areas close to central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), about 600 euros are required for a single, 450 euros for a double bed.
slightly lower values (550 euros for a single) for areas close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
You can save only if you stay away from the peripheral areas: 300 euros for one bed, and 450 euros for a single one in the Predestina, Centocelle or similar area.
In Naples, it takes 300/400 euros for a single bed, from 400 to 600 euros, with higher prices in the polyclinic areas, Vomero, and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, for bed, it is necessary to count 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a simple one.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they are of major importance in the urban economy.
Finally, cities such as Perugia, where rents are often taken by extra community students, there is a subsequent anomaly: the rent requested from foreign students is increased by 25/30% compared to that applied to Italians.
Farewell old cinema Paradiso, cities choose historic halls.
Historical cinemas are in favour of the Multiplex.
"A city without cinemas is a blind city, it's like a face without eyes"
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore, well illustrates what is happening in the large Italian urban centres, but also in the provincial cities,
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the birth in the periphery of the large halls, and the death of consumption of the mono halls in the central areas of the cities, is one of the major events that we find inevitable and undeniable; it also has all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
To disappear, these are often historical places and loaded with memory, "it's as if one of my friends disappeared, someone we know, with whom we shared a piece of road and so many emotions" observes the director of the New Cinema Paradiso, a film that offered to Tornato 20 years ago, the first Oscar as well as the Grand Prix de la jure de Cannes, and who narrated the poetry of a provincial hall, and the nostalgia in a way to live the cinema, lost can be forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the main association of traders, mean everything: over the past five years, 316 traditional cinemas have closed, and it is the rooms of the main cities that have paid the most: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closure, Emilia Romaine is leading with 82 cinemas mono halls lost, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
The evidence that confirms t that the first responsible for their disappearance is the advent of multiplex, because it is the three Italian regions that have recorded the most new multi-room cinemas: 195 screens plus in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany as well as Emilia-Romagne.
"The Italian exploitation has developed irrationally" notes Paolo Protti, President of the Annec, "it is useful to build new structures, but it is still necessary to guarantee the survival of those that already exist, because when a room in a city, these visitors are not necessarily all willing to go to multiplex.
Not to mention the missing deliberation of credit for traders: the previous debt of the state is about EUR 10 million.
It is shameful that, from an ethical and moral point of view, the Government does not respect existing laws.
To support the sector, it would take between EUR 16 million and EUR 18 million a year.
Note the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, concerned about these closures, decided to resolve the situation through the signing of a protocol between Mayor and Anec, the first of these in Italy, to defend and promote the cinemas mono halls of historical and peripheral centres.
The proposed regulations include tax facilities for managers and benefits to the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the restricted traffic area, and special parking rates will be available in some parking lots.
"It is an initiative that pleases" observes Giuseppe Tornatore "and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna putting in place other measures.
However, it is clear that, in order to contrast the superpower of multiplexes, traditional rooms must also improve the quality of sound and image, as today's audience is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the Bagheria Supercinema, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make "New Paradise Cinema" which I had already thought for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass in front of the Rialto, or the Quirinal of Via Nazionale, now closed, where I have experienced so much shared emotions, I turn from the other side not to see the blackboards by the dust.
Links between politics and ‘drangheta, arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro.
"The Mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to standardize the mayor's choices to the interests of the Piromalli clan."
heavy charges are launched by the magistrates of the Directorate antimafia de la Calabria, to the mayor and vice mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione, as well as Rosario Schiavione, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external competition for the Mafia Association.
The handcuffs also for Gioacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and the public administrations, and his little son lawyer, homonymous of the boss, already condemned for association of mafia-type criminals, as well as to pay 10 million euros.
"a response to legal and moral norms, and above all common sense," wrote the prosecutors, the two local administrations had expressed their willingness to pay for consultations with Master Piromalli.
"So it would have been given to the clan - the judges write - to officially enter the city halls facilitating the already considerable possibilities of control and guidance of the public administration"
The president of the Calabrian regional committee Agazio Loirero, only hides "collusions between local committees and organized crime, there are more than one" in his region: "there are places where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where the collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are also many politicians who resist the pressures of drangheta, heroes who are honest."
This morning's arrests followed those of July, after which the police announced that they had beheaded the Piromalli clan.
As of late April, the community council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved; already in 1991, and still due to alleged conditioning between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been discharged from their duties of administering the City.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, UDC's mayor at the time of dissolution, had been appointed head of a right centre coalition, after the May 2006 ballet.
He screamed at the scandal when the prefectures ordered the dissolution of the communal council.
He accused the deputy minister of the interior at the time, Marco Minniti, the accuser of having handled everything on a political issue, but given the application for incarceration signed this morning, the judges explained that the Piromalli clan had even succeeded in requesting the variation of the A3 project.
From the interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, the PMs write, emerged "the willingness to marry the demands of a businessman, representative of a better known group, close to the Piromalli, uniformizing the choices of public administration to the interests of the clan.
When the energy is born of waves, now the big ones launch .
This is a disproportionate deposit that occupies more than 70% of the planet's surface and now the world's largest energy companies are discovering it.
Waves, currents, tides, these are the new renewable sources on which colosses like Chevron have put their eyes, and now they are trying to get their hands on them.
The possibility of obtaining energy from sea movements has been studied for hundreds of years, and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
When the price of oil fell by 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was set aside, but now the ecological bodies and the new increase in oil give a great boost to the sector
London's World Energy Council (WEC) estimated in 2007 that 15% of the world's electricity needs could be covered by offshore coal mining systems.
This amount would be twice as high as that produced by nuclear power plants.
And in addition, there would be the currents and tides..
Colosseous to the attack.
The first company to put on marine energy was the Energy, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build a facility in northern Portugal.
When the agreement was announced, a true revolutionary step would have been said.
Two years ago, more and more candidates from these traditional energy companies have been putting on marine energy.
"Chevron is currently studying ocean energy technologies," said the spokesperson of a company associated with the American oil colossus, the economic daily Wall Street Journal, "and evaluates the possibilities of cooperating with us."
The cooperation in question concerns the obtaining of a permit deliberated by the American Energy Commission, which is necessary to give rise to a project for the exploitation of marine energy in Alaska.
This is a very interesting signal, especially if we consider that precisely in Alaska, the Usa continue to extract oil, and recently President Bush has put in place a project for new excavations.
In addition to Chevron, there is Verdant Power Inc. From New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey, which travel the way of energy coming from the sea, and the sums invested so far, although their details are unknown, indicate that observers, an increasing interest.
Technology to be developed.
Experts are talking about technology at its beginning, on the part of the fact that marine energy does not dispel fears about the ecological impact.
Currently, systems such as those in Portugal, or some in Scotland, are of small size, and do not seem to create major problems with the ecosystem.
To produce large-scale energy, however, technology must be used with a higher ecological impact.
"And the choices are diverse: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of bumps connected to each other.
The wave thrust, which moves the mud upwards and downwards, is converted into a hydraulic pressure of the pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
Pressure spins a turbine that in turn feeds a generator.
The energy is sent to the shore through marine cables.
For the moment, we have four systems of this kind in the project phase, pending a single federal approval and some of the energy could serve a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the contrary, already produces energy for a shopping mall and parking using six marine turbines from the East River of New York.
The movement of water during tides, turns the blades of turbines, creating a rotational movement that feeds a generator.
Verdant announced having a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to pull energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say to the Institute for the Research of Electrical Energy, is currently worth the potential of tides.
Although this is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable from the wind, the sun, or waves, and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
And it is precisely the energy of tides that states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others, look to the coast, invested $7 million in 2008 and forecast investments of up to $35 million in 2009.
