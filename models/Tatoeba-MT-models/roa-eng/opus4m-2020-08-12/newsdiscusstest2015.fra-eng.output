The remaining UKIPs that refuse those who live with HIV are a perfect example.
You're talking about when Nigel Farage says that the NHS should not be used to pay for those who come to the United Kingdom to do health tourism, and when, with this in mind, he answers yes when the interviewer specifically asks him whether people living with HIV are included in the unwanted ones.
First you use specific arguments, then you discredit them by a barely veiled homophobia.
Every time I and my family need NHS, we have to do the tailings behind the chronic hypochondriars who think that everything is due to them.
I think it's you who use specific arguments.
Health tourism, as defined by the right-wing geeks, is virtually non-existent.
I believe that is what democracy is called.
So no one would be affected by UKIP measures against health tourism, so there is no problem.
There is only in the parallel universe of UKIP that Carswell can appear as a revolutionary.
A quote from a torch does not constitute evidence.
Yeah, so shoot the messenger.
The Mail didn't write the report, he just commented on it.
Those who control the majority of the media in that country should be shot for spreading such populist propaganda as if it were reality.
I don't think you know what a specific argument is.
Neither do you know anything about my personal situation or identity, so you should be careful when you try to kill the debate on homophobia charges.
Farage's sentence has been very surprising, but only because we talk so rarely about this problem.
He made absolutely no homophobic remarks.
You'll have to be able to get back to it.
I'm not sure where you want to come from, but I imagine you don't like it when the media talk about what you don't like.
So rarely is this because contrary to Farage and his bold followers of Thatcher who believe that AIDS and floods are a sign of God and not a reflection on their own inability to understand that the complexities of humanity are something of good, so no.
Finally, the situation is as bad in Ireland as in Spain.
With the new crisis that comes during the austerity period, nothing will be fixed.
Expecting almost 5% growth in 2015 is a big joke.
Ireland's ''EUROPE TIGRE''' boasted us a few years ago.
We knew the rest of it!
This begins to read the article.
We are trying to make Ireland appear to be a virtuous country and a ''New Economic MIRACLE''' is happening.
With the Brussels agreement, imposed on the lowest societies in Europe, a very flexible labour market, a continuing emigration.
With these ingredients not what ''pavoise''' for the moment with the arrival of the Poles.
In the 1980s of the twentieth century, Irlance was one of the poorest countries in the European Union, with the Portuguese By considering a constant perimeter, without the new countries, the situation is always better than it was.
Greece was in front.
That their development was not a long, peaceful river, it is in view of recent events.
The lowest rate of taxes in Europe?
It's not true!
Latvia has a 0% tax rate on businesses.
Now there is a hypocrisy in France on the part of the policies on the taxes actually paid by multinationals.
If it is believed to be a report issued in 2008 or 2009, they pay less than 5% in France in general.
Only SMEs pay full pot.
Now I confirm that road traffic has become huge again, and there are new (and expensive) cars all over the street, just like before the 2008 crisis.
I have lived in Dublin for 14 years, the recovery is evident in the daily caps since the return.
Is this supposed to be economic news?
Don't worry, I'm sure the comments will soon be on fire.
In another article they are writing, 2 Vauxhaul Astra are involved in a hanging on the A140.
Does Ryanair now plan to transfer passengers from one flight to another in this way?
I believe that Mr. O'Leary will soon buy a whole new fleet of devices, so some bags and scratches on the old ones will soon be forgotten.
That said, I'm flying with him next week, so I hope it won't be on one of those two once you've got a chance.
Then it would be entirely the fault of the other pilot.
Did Ryanair pay passengers an extra fee for the additional fear we wanted to provide them?
But without this kind of Irish business, you couldn't afford to leave on vacation, young man
I never took Ryanair and the last three times I took the plane was with BA.
I prefer when the airline offers quality service.
No, but it's Ryanair, so they can give each other a good time.
Any Ryanair article triggers dozens of comments from people who would never take Ryanair for those who like to take Ryanair and think that those who pay anything other than the basic tariff have only to take themselves, etc.
It's pretty transparent.
Ryanair will not be satisfied with the additional costs due to this incident.
I wonder what the delays will be and whether the passengers will have to be compensated and, if so, whether Ryanair will be able to avoid paying by saying that it was an airport air controller error.
Passengers were placed on another plane in less than an hour, they were not entitled to compensation.
Sorry to disappoint you and your dreams of compensation.
Welcome aboard this British Airways flight that takes the English ISIS to Syria, not true as you say.
Good trip
Last Sunday in Paris, rue des Francs-Bourgeois: the Marais is largely pedestrian, and literally crawls around the world.
People do not come in mass for the quality of the restaurants (some, for the most part) or for the Review Salon at the White Manteaux Space (hyper-intellectual and slightly dusty).
The reason for this crowd is that stores are all open and the neighborhood is incredibly alive and lively.
With many foreigners who spend .....
Do you think Sunday opening will create jobs?
Go to Paris Rue des Francs Bourgeois where shops are open on Sunday, world-rich with 50% tourists.
@aloes Faux!
The only argument that would seem admissible to me is that of the areas receiving a large number of foreign tourists and it is clouded by the fact that they buy in detachment.
Tourism areas lose a considerable turnover each year for the same reasons .
The industry remains where expensive equipment, operated on Sunday, allows to lower prices .
Dominican rest is a right which employees benefit from, except for exceptions.
That is why it is planned and regulated by the Labour Code.
Neither the Minister for Economic Affairs, nor the Minister for Foreign Affairs, has the slightest competence to reform the Labour Code.
As long as they lock it up.
What's the law for?
To satisfy a part of the population and businesses who want to work on Sunday.
In Montreal on Sunday am I take my children to the municipal library.
In my town of 30,000 inhabitants where I live in France the municipal library is open 4 days a week but not the we!
This is access to culture ...
And it's also the regulation of working time.
the way of life he defended with tenacity against fascism
the way of life he defended with tenacity against fascism and Bolshevism
What if his daughter's estate was, against his will, to use to pay the inheritance costs?
There are paintings.
Some are good, others are terrible.
Perhaps his estate would want his share of the cake, if you pass me the expression.
his preference for a victory of the nationalists/Franco in the Spanish civil war...
And his hostility to the independence of places such as Ireland and India and his fascist ideas as a whole and also add his well-known hatred of the Jews.
Churchill wasn't perfect.
Neither do I.
But for five years, and only for five years, it was perfect.
In 1940 He led the other aristos of the government who wanted to discuss an "agreement" with the Nazis and he won very skilfully.
Thanks to his magnificent rhetoric and energy, he united the country with the idea that fighting the fascists was the only way to win.
The inhabitants of the United Kingdom, France and Belgium and, ultimately, the whole world can thank God for having had during these five years, just over the five years, Churchill at the bar and no one else.
Churchill's greatness has nothing to do with this discussion.
That his descendants sell the paintings on the free market to raise the money from inheritance expenses, they could even make a profit.
If the public wants to be able to admire one in a museum, they collect the money to buy it.
It's as simple as that.
But we could use the tax money.
No one can deny that when it was "the moment of truth," Churchill's personality was a positive advantage for his country during World War II.
A relaunch of the internal market through public works will only encourage large companies, which will increase their dividends by avoiding hiring, with infrastructure sites being by definition not renewable.
As for the social reforms advocated by the Minister, they reflect the real evil francai: their distrust of dialogue
Back to prince values.
A reform of unemployment insurance is not contradictory.
May the weakest of us not be in need!
Either we come to his aid, or he has DROIT in exchange for services that he renders or rendered to a minimum of resources.
The SM40H that I prefer to smic corresponds to this vision.
There is also the tenant who lives income from his property.
It is necessary to distinguish the person investing for a return at the time of his retirement and the one living from his rents.
One property to rent or two for a couple on top, it's vice
Finance's little genius lacks imagination alone.
The new deal was a policy of great work, but at a time of lack in large infrastructure.
Today, in Europe and France, that is not the case.
Developed countries are equipped.
The need for infrastructure is marginal so in no way a new deal could be a solution.
Especially at a time when the question of decline emerges in response to a recession which is only a savage decline therefore brutal
You would have been right 30 years ago: more need (or possibilities) of dams, coal mines, highways...
But if we want to make the future climate-energy shock less harsh, then the need for investments is overwhelming: isolation, renovation of the rail network, urban transport, transport and energy storage etc.
Taxation that promotes high incomes and rents.
Who's in power?
He's obsessed with smartphones.
Charles Arthur is really a galopin.
Samsung's profits are bad for the iPhone 6 and its competitors of the same range
The mid-September introduction by AppleTM of larger screens for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus may have seduced buyers who would otherwise have purchased a Galaxy
I tested all these phones and decided for the LG G3.
So Samsung lost me as a client, but not for Apple.
I believe it is essential that we have an alternative.
When Microsoft put in place this philosophy, we experienced a decade of stagnation that was finally broken by Google, Apple and the open source community.
We must have several dynamic platforms to stimulate competition and development.
In addition, we all have different needs and they cannot be met by a single manufacturer, because they are not compatible.
For me, I tend to buy Apple because I like their underlying philosophy and I like design.
Some people do not attach any value to design, for them options, functionality and price take precedence.
There's nothing wrong with that.
Let's stop looking for "a better platform".
Is there a "better car manufacturer", not really, they are different, but similar.
I would like to see a thriving mobile industry, with radically different approaches for different people and markets.
It's healthier and it needs to be encouraged.
That's what we're all interested in.
I'm glad you found exactly what you're looking for and that it's not an Apple product, even if I made a different choice.
Most people I know have iPhones.
Our umpfrontist friends who, according to one of them, fight ideas and not men (on the contrary, well on Parisian fools) could tell us which author they fight ideas about the genre and tell us the works they intend to fight.
Or are they attacking just the genre as described in Le Figaro, Minute or Actual Values?
Their sources are Judith Butler or Eric Zemmour?
Well, Jean, I love you, and you're an intelligent, cultivated person.
I said this about Judith in the vein of Furusato referring to Holopherne, a rapprochement that had not come to me (I do not have his lively mind).
Otherwise, in the "bottom", as you send it back, this subject is not of interest to me, and I honestly don't see where the problem is: I was hoping that you and your friends could get me out of my back, because I am slow but I understand well...
@ Jean: Recognize that culturally, sending Judith back to Holoferne, that does.
Who's afraid of the world?
But what are we afraid of those who fear?
Furasato and @ give us answers.
The first invoking Judith from the Bible, the second in calling Judith Butler a very symbolic throat slicer.
We see how much these studies affect the most intimate of them.
We are obviously no longer in the idea debate.
It's something else, much deeper.
@ Have you read,Jean, that the World has published an article on the need for theology?
@: With regard to a discussion of ideas, I thought it was appropriate to go to sources.
Aiming to fight ideas from the only exhibition their detractors make (Cardinal Ratzinger, inventor of the Theory of Gender or X Lacroix, theologian) doesn't seem very rigorous.
But, as I explained to our umpfrontist friend, it's the whole difference between having an informed opinion and a simple opinion.
I'm not sure he understands the nuance.
I didn't read Judith, the very symbolic throat slicer, I was content with the "Second Sex" (it was more than my time) that I believe the source of "the source" according to Lo's wishes.
As I watched the eclipse from Melbourne, I saw red lights when the moon briefly showed itself when the clouds opened.
This sudden appearance of the red moon had its charm and made up for a little disappointment of sometimes having the view blocked by the clouds.
It was fabulous here at FNQ.
Yes, last night's cloud would really close the coast of Victoria and NSW, while most of the rest of Australia had a clear time.
Special flash moon of blood.
Tony Abbott / Joe Hockey make Labor responsible.
But if the Labour accepts our unjust budget, we will give it its true color as soon as possible.
You're obsessed, aren't you?
I was in Melbourne then naturally I saw only clouds.
Melbourne has also managed to cover itself throughout the week of the meteor shower of the Persedes and for almost all the important astronomical phenomena of recent years.
I'm starting to think there's a bad genius whose only purpose is to prevent the inhabitants of Melbourne from seeing anything in the sky.
Melbourne is really not the best place for an observatory, even if things get much better on the other side of the Cordillera.
There were periods of 10 to 20 minutes where I could not see the eclipse because of the clouds above the suburb of Melbourne.
I'm gonna put a TAXE on this eclipse.
WHO looks at this eclipse should pay a TAXE.
I bet your first thought of the day is for Abbott, just like the last one before you go to bed.
Who or what will you obsess when it ends (strongly) to disappear?
You seem to spend a lot of time reading the discussions by looking for messages where people criticize the Abbott government and then accuse them of being obsessed.
Beautiful picture of the moon above the Harbour Bridge of Sydney.
It looks like Mars is going to collide with Earth!
Nothing on stock and real estate speculation.
Nothing on the inequalities between income from work and capital.
Nothing about tax fraud.
The other liberalism is killing Europe.
Nothing about Babylon's gardens...
The article says too much or not enough.
The details and arguments of these recommendations are not given.
There is no hyperlink to the original documents so that we can make an opinion.
Let's see today Tuesday, October 15, the results of the miracle revenues: in Spain, exports have been at the lowest for five years.
In Greece the stock exchange collapses.
Yet they seem to be the examples to follow.
The reform of notaries would generate a claim for compensation of EUR 8 billion.
The Ministry of Economics states that these claims for compensation are not based.
What if the Ministry of Economics errs?
Will decision-makers who have gained the political benefit resulting from the courageous attack of notaries have the same courage when submitting the invoice to the state budget?
The suite in time.
Okay, thanks, JYL...
@lol No the state is not comparable to households in terms of managing its budget because the temporal horizon of the state is theoretically infinite while that of the household is blessed by the life of its members.
In addition, unless public spending is considered unproductive, it contributes to financing material and intangible investments in future growth and therefore future revenues.
A few elements of the answer.
A regrettable decision.
But remember the sacred oath of Hippocrate: the health of the profits of global pharmaceutical companies must be preserved first and foremost.
Nice conspiracy theory.
Unfortunately the truth does not correspond to your ghost.
Medical staff would like to be able to use it, but they have their hands bound by law as written by policies.
This is the same situation as for the product that causes medical abortions rather than having risky surgical interventions, safe shooter rooms for drug addicts rather than having them on the streets, etc.
On these issues politicians want to please the uncultivated masses.
In fact, doctors don't make money with drugs.
That's why there are pharmacists.
Doctors don't make money with drugs since the Liberals want our health system to look like that of the United States, you should learn about how it works.
Doctors around the world are courted in the same way, but it is more or less visible.
It may have been poorly formulated to put the fault on the tubibs, but the reality is that many countries, including Australia, give priority to business profits and "research".
So read the few reports on our spending on Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and on negotiations with pharmaceutical companies compared to other countries.
Compare the world prices of drugs present everywhere, as well as differences from country to country about what is on free sale or only on prescription.
This strengthens itself is a political and economic process, not a medical or scientific process, directly or indirectly.
In fact, some companies are currently testing marijuana inhalations against cancer pain, despite the laws that hinder them and the expensive permits required.
Although manufacturers of certain drugs may not be happy that alternatives such as marijuana are used, those who arrive at a version offering good quality products at known doses will benefit widely.
Sorry to tell you ma'am but you're wrong, there's a lot going on behind the scenes for doctors and pharmacy.
As for this hospital, they were happy to use it until someone put the chip in the ear of an officer of that hospital.
We can't keep patents on grass...
If "researchers" in social sciences were doing research instead of doing politics and networking, their "work" could be used.
One investigator investigates, does not compare one fact to another.
Compare it's not looking.
To compare is to do pedagogy not research.
We can't say "search is done you have to apply it" and then in the same jet "you have to experience everything."
If your research is done, why experiment?
If your research isn't done, why do you ask us to apply it?
Can I be explained how a "researcher" can deduce that a student who cannot assimilate mathematics alone could more easily assimilate mathematics and other materials?
New technologies allow students to learn on the condition that they learn to use new technologies but how would they learn new technologies if they could not learn?
Pisa tests are only an indicator that allows us to find satisfactory indicators.
What's the point of building an indicator that informs you of what you're up to, a will for self-promotion, a deception?
Only one track to train teachers: to keep the sophists and ideologists away from training and to teach practitioners.
make reread the paragraph on internships (which is unfortunately not very argued) and you will see that your conclusion leads us to the most ineffective conservatism: "It is a device that primarily leads to the reproduction of existing practices, and does not allow the system to advance."
In view of the general consensus on the state of the French system, it cannot be hoped that only practitioners will teach practitioners, even if they have all their place in modern teacher training
Theoretists of education must have no place.
The practitioners must have one.
Would you like to be operated by a surgeon whose training is purely theoretical, and who has never set foot in an operating block before?
There is no consensus on the causes of the problems of the educational system.
Giving more weight to the theorists of education would ultimately destroy it.
Your analogy is totally fair: if I would not like to be operated by a practitioner who only has theoretical training, I would like to be operated by a surgeon who has no theoretical training and who has learned about the task force.
Mike Weatherley, Conservative MP for the fight against copyright violations by David Cameron
Why doesn't he just tell Cameron to stop?
Someone should make a popular arrest.
MDR exmaiers thank you.
If I ever start to feel guilty of violating copyright, I'll just read an article like this.
In an information economy, the violation of copyright = vol.
It's the same because they have to quote their sources correctly.
Often, getting a license costs nothing.
No, it's a violation of copyright.
Not exactly the same thing.
By using content without the appropriate license, you deprive artists of their breadwinner.
You can always discuss pedestrian assumptions - but it's theft.
And you can repeat it as much as you want, it won't become as true.
It's a violation of copyright.
Come on, repeat it again.
If one day I start to feel guilty of violating copyright
You obviously don't mind depriving artists of their income.
If they think they should receive money for images used in school duties, an almost perfect definition of what should be a reasonable use, then I am happy to deprive them of this fictitious income.
Lesson 1 should be to show how, if children themselves create anything and publish it on their preferred social networks, they leave any intellectual property to the site under the general conditions they have passed by a click.
Perhaps if they share the listeners of their mp3 walker with a boyfriend on the school bus, they should be expelled for violating the law in such a way.
Ah if we could export this resource that we're looking at, the grumbling that says everything's wrong...
If it is a PS Member who says so, then we must believe it.
I have 2 children and when they are of the age of choice, I would advise them to leave France if nothing has changed from here.
France shoots people down in the assistants continuously.
I do not want my children to bear the debt that this policy has created.
What brings France down are speeches like yours.
@gus I've been working in private business forever.
I had the CHANCE to have worked in companies run by excellent business leaders: it exists in France but it is rare.
I am employed because I know that I do not have the skills to run a business and this choice allows me to shoot red balls on the null patterns I often encounter.
At ease in my basketballs I fully share the post of Jean-Pierre Bernajuzan: he says the horrible truth!
@gus, when compared to German companies that French business leaders constantly quote to ask for reforms in France, in Germany companies have been able to structure their industrial fabric to make it competitive, in particular by ensuring the link between large and medium and small enterprises - What do French employers expect to do so?
That the state is holding their hand?
That state they accuse of empire?
& Jacques L.
Always this anti-business couplet on your part!
Remember me, what have you created as a job, as value added, to be so severe?
@ Pat I understand your reaction.
In fact, France is faced with an insoluble problem: the incompetence of French business leaders unable to create jobs and who are bouncing and undermining while waiting for the permanent assistance of the State!
That's terrible!
But they have solutions: abolition of the Labour Code, employer charges, taxes, work 45h/week paid 35, and some, walking on eggs, dare to claim a reduction in wages if not their abolition!
I look forward to seeing all the "negative" comments on this subject.
Which is ironic given the way people still complain about the First Group.
According to what I see from where I am, Last wasn't really an investment for us taxpayers.
They tried to keep themselves floating rather than transform themselves.
It doesn't mean that the Scottish railways haven't improved since Last took care of it.
But they had also improved with their predecessors, including British Rail.
Unfortunately, we do not have the power to do this, unfortunately.
I tried to have them recently, but I didn't succeed.
But well, the Labour is gonna get us bored, isn't it...
It's an international subsidiary.
They already operate trains in Germany.
Nothing prevents people in the UK from creating a more moral company and taking part in tenders.
But it seems that we are not very good at managing, most of our privatized services end up being managed by a foreign operator.
I still remember scandal and criticism when First won the Virgin contract, all so that the decision was finally cancelled.
And there's better: MTR, a Hong Kong company has won Crossrail's operating contract for 8 years.
Well, the Labour, as they repeated to us during the referendum campaign, is totally for sharing and sharing and thinks that workers must all help themselves across borders.
It can therefore be assumed that they will be happy with this decision ;)
Maybe it's because Dutch management is on good tracks while British management isn't.
What ScotRail needs is not just a change of ownership but above all new ideas.
Abellio is perhaps the least bad choice possible, but the real problem is the ridiculous system of franchises, not the franchiser.
"She was a beating girl."
Lord, I hate, but I really hate that kind of expression.
To assume that being "batting" is a quality superior to many others, the concern of others, intelligence, listening, for example, the fact of being "batting" has nothing to do with surviving a disease: cancerous "battants", who are not least dead, I know of it.
Coming out of a disease has nothing to do with merit.
Let's start again.
I'm not telling you it's the condition to manage, I'm telling you it's aid.
Nothing to do with any merit!
When you're in the examples of your life, there's only you to judge them.
I'll start over.
Insinuating, it would only be for a moment, that one can have merit to get out of a disease or that one can deserve not to get out of it, is simply monstrous.
The body follows or does not follow.
A body that releases, everywhere, despite the will, despite the trust in medicine, do you have a vague idea of what C?
I am sorry to think otherwise, if having a strong morale may make it easier to accept heavy treatment and prepare for it, to try experimental treatments like this woman did and not refuse them out of fear.
Someone who's fighting medicine is primarily someone who trusts medicine..
But if we prefer to go back to the "sir" it's something else.
Neither with merit nor with courage.
These considerations are specific to moralists.
When you catch a dirt, a real dirt, you get yourself stripped to the point of becoming a zombie.
I personally caught two, dirt, big ones, and if I fought like these psychological ends say, it completely escaped me.
Unless this fight consists only of tightening teeth, suffering hell and beatings.
I thought the charge against Milosevic was decided and finalised about ten years ago.
I haven't seen that name in newspapers since at least that time.
What's going on?
It's a birthday.
A forgotten birthday.
His trial was carried out "fast" and then swept under the carpet.
Is this the story we told at the time?
The communist became a nationalist who triggered three wars in the Balkans over the last decade?
The Communist President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia?
Please ask what we have voluntarily left behind: 1.
How could NATO bombings be legal under the MOINDRE rule of international law?
Which country did Serbia attack?
About RTS (Radio-Television-Serbia), why not mention that NATO destroyed the same building by killing civilians and then considered it a valid target.
Milosevic had no way out of it: if he did not defend his country against NATO attacks, he would be crucified as a traitor.
And if he defended him, he would be swallowed by the western compressor roller.
The Westerners used a smoke screen to detach part of a sovereign state that then unilaterally proclaimed its independence and was quickly recognized by the Western States, which then ultimately lied about the situation on the ground.
The Serbian population has now completely disappeared (ethnic cleansing).
Vojislav Kostunica, mentioned here, died politically after his first term of office for not having understood the situation that had developed.
Zoran Djindjic was one of the most controversial figures in the political world of the time.
Finally, the Guardian should not call Milosevic tyran (even if we did not love him).
To my knowledge, there is only one method of predicting earthquakes in Greece that is walking about, measuring the piezoelectric level in the quartz.
Such studies are undoubtedly useful and thank you for sharing the results.
A hope, therefore, but caution is put This water has nothing to do with that of the exoplanet named HAT-P-11b, located about 124 light years from Earth in the Cygnus constellation that would be "the smallest and coldest planet to present detectable water molecules," according to a study conducted by Drake Deming's team and Jonathan Franine of the University of Maryland.
So the method to follow.
Just like those that involve animals feeling a threat to come.
Thank you Science Passer for giving us, often, these experimental prowesses that are realized in the world.
How would animals know (advancely)?
Probably due to the perception of other elements whose rate changes in the case of earthquakes.
Like radon, for example.
An a priori gas odor for man but perhaps detectable by animals.
All these methods are undetectable for man, but not for the instruments of measurement available to him.
But we don't have a reliable result on these tracks...
It has been observed many times (and for centuries) that some animals have acted strangely a few hours with a earthquake, including chickens, cows, dogs but especially fish and snakes.
I had seen a report on art telling about the fight of two scientific teams, one Californian, the other Japanese, to acknowledge the validity of their work that related to the sensitivity of animals to earth's magnetic fields, and especially to their modification before a earthquake.
So of course I'm not scientific, but their assumptions convinced me!
Or are we on these research?
Why so much contempt for this track?
We should learn to listen to nature again...
If you look at things calmly and rigorously, you publish it in a serious magazine, and no one despises it.
As soon as we talk about the "signs" given by the animals, we encounter each other in the same way: everyone will remember that 5 minutes before a earthquake the red fish was spinning strangely round.
I don't understand that one can think that Boris would make a good leader for the Conservatives.
He did too much as the mayor of London.
When we listen to the LBC program we can't help but think that this man knows nothing about it and always tries to have fun with a joke.
He never responds directly to anything.
He also said he agreed with Farage, and then Nick Ferrari asked him what.
He couldn't name one point.
He made so many promises to be elected as mayor and he did not keep one.
It just highlights how much the rest of the Conservative Party is just a bunch of shit, doesn't it?
Because it's popular.
Because it's funny.
It was in "Have I Got News For You".
Because it's a celebrity and people have been taught the worship of celebrities.
The Londoners voted for him and he will be voting for him for the rest of the country.
When (and not if) he takes the leadership of the party, the popularity rating of the Tories will crack the ceiling I am certain of it.
God help us.
I'm not so sure: people like jokes, but they don't want their prime minister to be one.
That's exactly what the Londoners said.
He should have brought with him his friend the parpaing, smarter than him
In many ways, I think he's trying to copy R Branson
The Americans had one as President.
The French have really and always been uninterested in the history of the Pacific War.
For all those who have been able to read a few books (there are, among them, a French and excellent B.
Millot), the "Solomon" and the "Shipping Strait" speak, unfortunately as much as the dead who remained there.
It is understood that the Australians, who know (one of their heavy cruisers, Australia, must always be there from the bottom since the Battle of Savo) did not want to return there.
We actually spent in front of the island of Savo, in the "Iron Bottom Sound".
Even if the mission comes to an end.
It's the little ones.
But the green side is a total smoke.
Calculate kerozen consumes to achieve the goal totally discredits the concept..
Just go through the list of sponsors than philanthropists.
A coma operation no longer does or does.
The cow, it gives too much desire!!!
I look forward to the webseries!
Your story makes me look back, identifying me a little bit at the pass (I also learned to sail with the Crocos of L'Elorn at the White Moulin in the Brest race!).
Chapel also for the ecological message, although some criticize the impact of the movement.
The end justifies the means.
Continue to review us, and show with pride that the Bretons are great travelers!
Pierre, Trinidad and Tobago.
Good evening I think the red hat that has shown against taxes is happy to know that this trip is sponsored by the Region of Brittany and the City of Brest.
More seriously it seems to me that local authorities and public bodies of any kind should not devote a sum of our taxes to financing the dreams of some adventurers even as nice as those!
Are there any players in the current Serbian formation who are of Kosovare origin?
I know that Dusan Bajevic in Lyon and Milos Krasic, formerly in Juventus and now in Fenerbahçe, are from Mitrovica, but I don't know if they're still in the team
Bisevac is Lyon's defender, not Bajevic.
Bajevic was in the middle of the field or before in the 1970s and 1980s and trained many teams in Greece, but I don't know where he is from.
Bajevic is from Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and has played as an attacker in the great team of Velez who, under the supervision of legendary Suleman Rebach, completed twice in second place in the Yugoslav League (and also included points such as Vahid Halilhodzic and the faithful team of Arsène Wenger, Boro Primorac).
Well, thank you, Mole!
Of course I know Halilhodzic and Primorac.
Just out of curiosity, what happened to Krasic?
It was said that he was going to become a great player when he was in Juve, he is currently in Turkey, but the last time he appeared on my radar screen he was bound to Blackburn *frisson*
There, I can't help you.
I know he lost his place when Conte arrived, then he went to Fener and as much as I know he didn't own it.
Maybe he can still do something, maybe in the Indian Super League?
Seriously, Serbia.
Seriously, Albania, don't be afraid.
You should love Albania because you're neighbors.
The thing is that the flag of this drone is not the flag of true Albania today.
Apparently it was the flag of Great Albania, which encompasses all regions where there is an important Albanian presence.
A little excessive nationalism, in fact.
Fortunately, there was not too much damage (I know).
In fact, it was an Albanian flag with the map not of what is called the Great Albania, but of Albania before 1913, when the great European powers decided to give the neighbouring countries ends.
How can one have felt "an explosion of joy" by seeing two towers collapse knowing that women, men and children are without doubt inside?
How????
What bothers me a little bit in this "witness," is that the only fact that I could, would only once, spontaneously rejoice at the horrible death of thousands of people, bears witness to a "line border" personality that all the "witnesses" should be taken with the greatest circumspection.
Perhaps in the short moment of "joy", we would not have thought of the dead or the reality of the horror inflicted.
We will have just thought, for a moment, that for once Muslims had succeeded in doing truly and apocalypticly evil to the great wicked Satan in his own heart.
To make qqch powerful.
Great.
It seems that this feeling has been shared by thousands of Muslims oppressed by their sense of humiliation.
With testimonies filmed in Palestine.
Classic Schadenfreude.
We doubted it a little.
The western "Christian/white/Gaulois" cannot measure the degree of frustration, anger, hatred of the Muslim when it contemplates the gender poverty, the social and cultural underdevelopment of today's Muslim Arab world.
I'm talking about the faubourgs of Cairo or Algiers, not the towers of Dubai.
The splendid past, certainly magnificent is not a consolation, on the contrary.
How do we get the Muslim world out of this evil annoyance?
Totally in phase, 2 major poisons irrigated the Arab world l: the bigot conservatism of the powers in place and the fascist nihilism.
The common point, the freezing of thought and the excommunication (soft or armed) of its critical expression.
As soon as we understand it before, we must not have Muslims retreated.
It's the only way.
Did Edwy Plenel read this article?
I suppose that is true in many countries.
But in Britain, autumn marks the beginning of six long dark, humid and depressing months that affect the well-being and mood of many people.
Besides, everyone gets sick.
Seasonal depression.
I'm suffering from it myself.
When the light goes away, it becomes hell for me and those like me.
A dose of vitamin D should help a little for mood and well-being.
The fall is beautiful in Britain, with or without rain.
The campaign in particular is to cut the blow in the fall.
Not as much to cut off the breath as the green of summer when everything is alive instead of being about to die.
In Britain, if you're lucky, summer falls a weekend.
We had a great summer this year, don't make your grunt who slows down the clichés!
Not everyone.
I rarely get sick in winter.
But now I'm retired and I don't develop immunity to germs from outside, it can change, I guess.
It's not about to die, it's just a step in a cycle...
A wonderful stage full of energizing smells, with a fever that culminates with festivities such as Halloween, Guy Fawks, Christmas, the risks of snowing and full of other wonderful words.
Just keep doing things!
Here are my recommendations for parties for you.
Yes, these dark and gray months actually make me much happier and more relaxed.
For the taxation of increases for children , it is the amount charged by the State that comes mainly from Deciles 8 to 10 .
However , with regard to the number of households having seen their tax increase following this measure , Decils 4 and 5 are mainly concerned ( median income ) according to Chart 2 .
The elimination of the half part concerning widows is not at all dealt with in the article or rather its impact is completely under assessment: €230M is a joke that does not take into account the impact in 2012 and 2013 and implies that it is painless.
And it's not ready to settle.
Well, we're not on straw for sure, but thinkers.
For once the PS makes a politics rather left we won't cry...
It is clear that those who are among the richest 20% must bear much more than 75% of the increase in taxes, why not 90%?
Let's continue this way and you'll encourage these 20% unless you work or leave.
Well, I know, it's not politically correct, but I'm saying it anyway.
Live the Trots and OICs recycled in the PS: they understood everything.
Adam, you don't see what you're looking at.
The proportion is always the same here or in Bahrain: 20% of the population own 80% of the wealth.
A fair tax is when he forbids anyone to collect as much as he can.
Beyond a certain limit, money loses its full use.
And once the money's worth is exceeded, money is used only to make money, that is to say to make the most of it.
We are among the richest 20%.
Probably also of the 20% households that work the most (and create the wealth that a part is logically redistributed).
A fair tax must allow these households to take advantage of some of their efforts.
Or so much lower your arms and live minimum social, especially if you have social housing .
The utopias of the red Khmer head cutters have fortunately lived.
I did two AirBnB in Norway recently.
No problem.
In one of the two, we had things that we wouldn't have had in a 5 star hotel and we didn't have to show up at the reception or face any worries.
Just go to someone's house, sleep there, store behind yourself and leave.
Now this will be my first option when I'm on my way.
The logo has changed, people...
Check your insurance before renting your home.
In most cases you will need a kind of owner insurance.
Make sure you use a service with the right logo!
Ah, 6 o'clock too late.
I love Airbnb.
"It's very dangerous and highly risky" No, it's not true.
You just really missed luck.
Based on the link provided in the section:
At its discharge, Airbnb's response to Teman was rapid, almost absurdly rapid.
Within 24 hours, according to an email provided to Gawker by Teman, Airbnb had sent a locksmith to change the locks, made arrangements for him to spend a week at the hotel and transferred $23,817 (for which Airbnb is insured, but still).
So why does this article quote Teman complaining that he received no support from Airbnb?
I adore AIRBNB, to receive as to travel
Hello I'm looking for people who've already used bnb air just to reassure me.
I'm looking forward to paying a discount and a month's rent at once but I'm a little afraid to send £1,000 to a site I've never really heard of.
But where are we going?
"Support the troops," sang the Bu$herie on every tone...
So harmless weapons.
I am sure that this will please families and close to thousands of dead Kurds in halabja to learn that their parents and friends have succumbed to something other than the chemical bombings of Saddam Hussein.
Unless the content of the article has been radically modified by the author, your comment is inappropriate (to remain polite).
Furthermore, why would this mass crime committed in 1988 prove that the chemical weapons discovered nearly 20 years later were still usable?
It is not super clear the author's style: "in search of weapons of mass destruction.
We agree.
You think it's time to weaken the army to strengthen education.
This is never the time to strengthen education, because we are still at war.
Alternative: Is it always time to strengthen education, because we are still at war?
Education would already be greatly strengthened if "they" were to work 35 hours instead of 17.
At present, our teachers are gaining more than engineers.
And let us not believe that teachers spend 18 hours a week preparing their program.
But this cannot be seen because National Education does not have the means to provide an office to the college/lycée to its teachers so they work at home.
A kind of forced teleworking in sum, except that the employer does not pay for the computer, internet connection or supplies.
Besides, it's so flat at 5:00 a week and 4 months of vacation that we can't complete the math CAPES, come on, we're waiting for you.
How come you don't want to collect poorly educated clairvoyants whose parents spit on you by treating you as a handkerchief?
I believe that the priority in this area is to disarm the jihadites so that the population of Khurde can better thrive.
Where we can see that the Bush administration has absolutely gone through everything.
My first graduate job was in the sale, in London, to earn three times and yet it was a job for which a diploma was required.
A year later, I saw an announcement to be a London metro worker, paid £5,000 more a year and did not even claim the patent.
I've never regretted it.
In this respect, don't do it if you don't find a graduate job, try to find something that pays well, or you like to do it.
If I'd stayed at the graduates' jobs, I'd still be paying my student loan.
I don't like business work so much, so I hope to eventually be in the public service or in the university world.
LOL LOL LOL This article is really late!
Exactly, when I graduated in 2011, there was already a three-year arrears.
The best way to reduce the number of unemployed graduates?
Getting rid of bious lines such as art / letters / theatre / media / philosophy / political sciences, that is what we call unemployed diplomas.
I have one of these degrees and I'm a production director.
It turned out that the important thing was not the degree but, as the above article says, a good career, starting at school and throughout the university.
True, the starting wage was lower, but the levels are rapidly rising because in the real world, what counts is results more than knowledge.
This debate engineering studies/arts have lasted for years.
Scientists can't solve all problems, it's more important to be able to get up in the morning, get to work on time, and interact with people in order to achieve results.
Letters, philosophy and art are bious lines?
That's ridiculous.
I'm guessing you're talking about a media study degree or whatever the absolute line where you went.
Letters, philosophy, political sciences and art are real lines.
We need people who can explain the big questions to high school students, who understand the importance of the foundations of culture such as literature, art, etc., and highlight them.
Wouldn't it be better if it was a real territorial policy to disengage Paris and boost the rest of France?
Personally, I find it hard for the people of the background of the Essonne and Val-d'Oise to go back and forth every day by bike to come to work in Paris.
Intra-wall and small-belt inhabitants already have many more practical common means of transport (métro, bus, tramway).
> Several secure and key-closed parks, as already exists in the cities of northern Europe, Dijon or Lyon, will be installed on the road.
Good idea.
On the surface, the space is cannibalized by the 2RM.
Incidentally, it is hoped that the City of Paris will work with professionals from the Netherlands and Denmark.
Both benefit from their extensive experience in the field.
Well, we didn't find room for one single bike coupling device.
The motivation seems stronger when it comes to finding an office for Bertrand Delanoë....
Well, it's not okay at all.
When we discuss with pedestrians and other users of public transport the reasons why they do not pedal it seems to me that the main reasons are: 1/ it is super dangerous with all these bathrooms, these trucks, these scooters that ride super fast and fuck the survival of the bikes 2/ we take full pollution in the head For me the bicycle tracks are going flat, we need to reduce the traffic car (urban weight type congestion charge), reduce the speed (Paris = zone 30), enforce the road code by systematically verbalizing (even the bikes to bemmol before it is necessary to adapt the code of the written road for animals 100 years ago to the bicycles), generalize the buffer zones after the closed passages, not before the banals and scooters do not generate.
The bicycle tracks are apartheid, but we need to cohabit but rebalance the occupation of urban space.
Anything on the bike in the great Paris?
Not a word on the bike's place in public transport?
EELV is right.
The objective of 15% of veil movements is ridiculous.
I'm starting to believe that Anne Hidalgo rolled the greens into the flour.
In addition to what is reported by OR, the EELV assistants seem sceptical.
I'd rather be optimistic.
Before the racket starts, it would be better to find out who really hides behind this massacre.
Index: It's not Russia.
I'm not sure I like the way the world evolves.
It looks awful.
My children are not a financial asset.
A lawyer expressed his intention to bring the case before the ECHR, but I did not hear that a complaint had actually been filed.
In addition, they should first file a complaint in Germany or Ukraine.
I also expect these cases to be rejected pending the outcome of the accident investigation report and the criminal investigation that would result from it.
Yeah, but Libya didn't blow up Pan Am 103 either.
Malaysia Airlines is not wrong, the fault lies with the air space security authority, in this case the Ukrainian government.
Was the accident predictable?
Other aircraft had previously been shot down, Ukraine was launching into the zone of air strikes against rebels and any aircraft could of course be considered a possible and immediate threat.
Has the Ukrainian government taken reasonable precautions in view of an obvious threat or has it chosen to play with innocent people's lives for airlines to pay for land overflight rights?
Where are all the pro-Kiev trolls that defend their usurping government / ultranationalists of Western Ukraine - and who want to show in general that Putin has shot down flight MH17.
As far as I know, there is already a complaint against the Government of Kiev because they are responsible for what is happening in their heavens.
The previous one: a 1986 judgment of the International Court of Justice which concluded that the supply of weapons by the CIA to the rebel forces of the Contras in Nicaragua did not mean that the United States was responsible for their actions.
There is no chance that Russia will not let this case go to the ICJ.
It's funny to think Abbott wants to tell Putin that Australians have been murdered by rebels supported by Russia.
I hope he can provide evidence to support his allegations.
So far the investigators have said nothing like that.
His name is Ricardo and being such an eco-friendly belotian, it's distressing!
His name is Polar is losing the north is exciting.
One question of belotian: is today's poorer than yesterday's poor?
I can't help but notice that those who criticize Piketty's book most virulently have not read it!
It's easy to read, I took a few days.
It shows the statistical evolution of income-production, income-capital, inequality-concentration, inequality of income from work, ownership of capital, merit and inheritance in the term log.
It shows that the concentration of today's capital joins that of the beginning of the 20th before 1914, it shows that it was the 2 world wars that lowered the concentration of capital, from 1914 to 1945, and then how the concentration resumes after...
Bernajuzan: you say no to what.
I ask you how long it took you to read this pave knowing that an individual's concentration capacity has some limits.
Then the question is not whether it is easy to read.
The question is whether the summary of the central thesis given by the press is fair or not.
If it is fair, we can debate it without reading the book, the main point of which is to argue in a unique sense in favour of it.
No, it's easy to read...
Bernajuzan: How long have you spent reading it?
Is the central thesis of its pave summarized by the press false?
I haven't read it and I won't read it.
I therefore rely on the summary of his central thesis and that is what seems to me to be pure fumistry.
The notion of a gap between rich and poor is subsidiary.
Hasn't humanity been globally enriched?
And this enrichment added to an increase in the population is the real political issue today.
Malala Yousafzai is an impressive personality and deserves the price without a doubt.
But remember, she's only 17.
An age at which most people just start finding their place in the world.
I hope that this prize will not be a burden on the girl and that she will find her way to live a happy life.
The problem is not the price but the political capital of Western governments who want to prove the old saying that colored perverts are the incarnation of evil.
All my wishes for happiness in Malala, but she must realize that it is used and that nothing will be done to educate girls in Pakistan or elsewhere - even in the popular neighborhoods of Great Britain!
Someone thought his speech was a little strange.
She thanked her father for giving her much freedom but said that if she was not there where she is now, she would have been married at 14 years of age.
Is not Malala herself part of these "colored perverts"?
You should not have any "antenna time" on this site.
You're a terrible pervert yourself.
It's absolutely revolting.
No, her father wasn't going to marry her when she was 14.
She was 15 when she was shot.
His father runs a school where girls are educated and he is in favour of equal rights for women.
It is, and has always been, that she receive higher education and that she has the right to decide her own marriage.
However, he is an unusual person in Pakistan, as he thinks women are equal to men.
What she said was that an average Pakistani girl should often get married at 14 years of age, without having her say.
I'm sorry she didn't state it in a sufficiently eloquent way for you.
This may seem contradictory, but perhaps it means that if her father had not given her freedom, she would have been married at 14 years of age.
Rather disappointed by this entry in season 4 and especially by Jessica Lange who obviously has a bit of difficulty finding her character from Marlene Dietrich.
I have just looked at the last two seasons that are quite different but I must admit that it is one of the best horror series, one of the most successful!
A fascinating first episode.
The realization is close to perfection and Jessica Lange's show singing the anachronistic Life on Mars of Bowie is simply overthrown.
I haven't watched this new season yet (which will be the last for me, without Lange bof bof).
In the case of American Horror Story I prefer to have all of a sudden to watch 13 episodes spread over 3 to 4 months.
But one thing is about, outside of Jessica Lange's extraordinary, it's mostly the risks of staging and staging that helped me.
There is an avalanche of original plans in AHS that makes it easy to accept today's productions.
I'm a little out of sight to see you throw the sponge in advance for the next few seasons without even waiting to be able to control the quality of it.
Jessica Lange is certainly a pillar of this series but, you say so well, there are many other things.
It's not just that for me Jessica Lange (and especially her way and the way she uses it) is really one of the pillars of the series outside the technical qualities.
And good bah I look a lot for her.
Then I find that the series is fishing in writing, she wants to do too much at the same time.
Season 3 was slightly below, in season 2, it was too scattered despite some excellent episodes.
I don't see them doing 10 seasons of American Horror Story or it'll end up like 24 hours what.
But good everyone does what he wants!
That's why I say "I won't look later" that everyone is forced to do the same!
I simply share my point of view nothing more, nothing less.
Jessica Lange's loss, I think she'll be fatal.
But then, that's just my opinion.
Let's talk about less tax increases, please - let's cut rather in state spending.
No, let's increase the expenses please.
Those who wanted to know the expenses failed.
Initiate controversy over relatively small expenditure positions, such as development assistance
The problem is that this represents less than the margin of error in government spending in the United Kingdom.
The truth is that we are all talking about nuances rather than the change of orientation that voters seem to call out of their wishes and during all this time some, in each camp, pretend that these nuances are much more important and substantial than they are - and voters see clearly in their game and find them in bad faith.
Less than 1% of expenditure.
"debt" is assets held mainly by financial institutions in this country.
The "debt" is nothing to worry about.
I would see no problem with the government owning a third of my income (before even talking about consumer taxes) if I thought it would use it properly.
But that is not the case, and many taxpayers feel the same way.
It is said that Nigel Farage was not entirely honest about how to reduce taxes but good, if you add our net contribution to the EU, development aid, High Speed 2, wind subsidies to almost useless and nuclear power plants that cost twice what they should, you come up with a figure that makes Labour and Lib-Dem tax quite ridiculous about the most luxurious residences.
Your first £10,000 is not taxable.
This means that someone who earns £35 000 a year will pay about £5,000 (one seventh of their wages), someone with £50,000 would pay around £10,000 (one fifth), etc. and someone with £200 000 pays about £70,000 (a little more than a third).
What about social contributions?
The more social contributions, the more local taxes, the more parking costs and the car vignette, and that's before VAT.
Almost exactly 30% of my money is collected from the source before local taxes and car vignette.
I am paid decently, but not extravagantly.
Not that it's a problem, of course, I'm happy to pay my taxes.
But let's not pretend that money falls from the sky, or it's not important to know where billions of pounds of taxes are going.
How can a unemployed person looking for work at the door-to-door prove it?
Although 20% of the unemployed wouldn't look, that means 80% are looking and they don't find.
Being unemployed myself, do I have more interest in what others are looking for or not?
If a potential recruiter gets 10 or 20 CVs, it increases my chances of so much.
Actually, I haven't heard from Pôle Emploi in months, which means that agents are more busy in control operations than really getting job ads back?
I don't see any interest.
Because it is not for the State to provide work.
If Pole Employment does not provide enough jobs, then you have to move on to Pole Employment.
What is a sensitive subject?
We all have rights and duties, in this instance we make sure that the unemployed do their duties well in return for their rights.
Just as a controller asks users for their transport title, a head of service, or they are employees of their work, etc.
Nobody screams at the scandal in those cases, right?
It is indeed good to remember that the unemployed have rights: the only two times that I had dealt with at the Employment Centre, my rights to the ARE had been poorly established, and on one of the files, amputated by 40%, it had to be fought firmly.
It takes time!
I'm not an expert in law.
The fact-finding and control is currently taking over, while legally the Employment Policy is close to being, in fact, an insurance company.
I would add that the subject of compensation should only concern employees, it is they who pay the costs.
Non-wage politicians and French workers grant themselves rights they do not!
It's not normal.
I would add that decent unemployment insurance contributes to the enhancement of wage labour.
More than waiting for killer tweets in Arabic...
In fact, we need to have a direct military response in Iraq / Syria that will arrest Isis so that this virus does not reach this conflict zone.
The situation would then resemble the spread of black plague in 1348/9 in connection with war and displacement of populations at the time.
The Saudis had the mind to ban the Hadj at Mecca this year to Muslim pilgrims from the three affected countries.
El Pais reports that 7,400 have seen their visa applications refused because of their country of origin or their recent travels.
In fact, there was the case of a pilgrim from Bosnia who contracted smallpox at Mecca during the Hadj in the 1980s, probably contaminated by a pilgrim from Somalia, where the disease still exists.
I hope the rest of the world will have the same presence of mind.
Is it heartless to propose to prevent Ebola patients from taking a plane for Europe?
I thought it was simple common sense but apparently those "knowers" decided that we could risk the lives of tens of thousands of people...
These West African countries where Ebola is out of control should be placed in strict quarantine.
No one's out.
Only health personnel can enter.
21 days of waiting after treating patients before they can leave.
If they contract the Ebola virus while they are there, they stay there until they are cured.
These are not draconian measures.
Just last week, people were contaminated after having had contacts with people in West Africa even though they took "all the necessary precautions".
We can stop the advance of this disease.
It is mainly spread by airlines.
Let us forbid them from offering to fly to these countries.
In addition, customs officers at airports should be trained to identify people with typical Ebola symptoms so that they can be placed immediately in quarantine.
May he pass on the message of the first individual and of the second (including religious) group and deserve the Nobel Peace Prize.
I doubt he will be able to erect in dogma the image of God characterized by the total cortex of the planet in operation.
He's still far from that design there.
It was only 20 years ago that the information appeared as the premium given to mankind, while religion, coming from the brain, has been leading our actions since maybe Lucy.
What is the interest of becoming a Protestant church?
For those who have not noticed it, Catholicism is largely minority in France today, no one is forced to join it.
Those who criticize would not in any way set foot on the Church, there is only to see the low number of Protestants in France.
What's the next step, removing the notion of sin, too "angiogenic"?
@louise: Sorry the church does not have a limited vision to France.
And in the world, it may be that it will touch more people...
@Martine E, to be honest (as usual) the respect of others as you envisioned it preexisted to the Christ.
Hillel had already told him: "Don't do to others what you don't want to be done to you, this is the whole Torah and the rest is just comment: go and study!".
Christianity goes well beyond a mere reciprocity but introduces the agape.
Your "progressing justice, peace, fraternity" but without God?
Is it a return to communism? :-)
Next step: We remove the incarnation and the resurrection.
Jesus will remain this hero who has overturned moral laws by redefining the respect of others.
Christians will then be ready to assume their role in the ethical debates of our societies and to advance justice, peace, brotherhood.
Not very Catholic?
I think I remember that the low number of Protestants in France is mainly explained by the fact that their ancestors were exterminated and then converted from force and pushed to immigration a few centuries ago.
I hesitate too much between buying this, the new Alien game, or Wasteland 2.
And the new Elite game is coming out soon.
It's not inventive.
I personally would choose SoM.
I like Wasteland 2 (I even participated in his fundraising campaign) but I don't think it's worth £30.
If you are interested in the PC version, Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM at £30 and also offers a 20% discount voucher.
Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM at £30 and also offers a 20% discount voucher.
I'll take a look.
Of course not at work.
The computer department's jollies block all the nice sites.
Hello, is it £30 then 20% reduction, or does the £30 include 20% reduction?
Note however: the PC version is only for DX11.
I was surprised, I bought it, but I can't play it.
Besides, I bought it on Steam, so no refund, it's nothing.
It's time to buy a new video card * made up your mouth*
It's a Brazilian site, but you get a valid Steam ID, I think.
Caveat emptor and all that: I didn't use it myself.
Amazon £30 for PC, £35 for Xbox 360 and PS3, £44 for Xbox and PS4
Thank you, I'd be afraid that one day they'll wipe it out of your library if they decide to abuse the people who buy it there while they're outside the planned area.

So, was France in 1940 a "poor land"?
So say, this Nobel prize looks like a poisoned gift to me.
Do you have to love France of 40, that of "the strange defeat"?
When you see who gets the Nobel Literature, you wonder if Proust or Dostoyevsky would have it today.
The Nobel is not even an event, we don't even want to read the award-winning authors.
Are Brazilians, Chinese or Australians going to read Modiano who is already difficult to read in French and who describes such a limited and self-centered universe?
I hope the other Nobels are more credible, but frankly I doubt that.
Modiano, Levy, Musso have only a distant relationship with literature.
Did you at least read it?
Or another Nobel prize?
It would be better to judge.
As for Chinese, Brazilians and others, don't worry about them.
Foreigners are very sensitive to French literature and culture, they.
They can appreciate M.
Modiano at its fair value, if they don't already know him!
On your side, continue to attend Lévy and Musso.
I share your opinion.
Marc Levy and Guillaume Musso retain all their chances.
Then let's see who got the Nobel Literature: H.
Pinter in 2005, D.
Say hello to the terrible ones.
Since I drove one to Iceland, I haven't stopped seeing Kia Sportage anywhere.
I think this thing's been following me so far.
Maybe she wants to crush me?
Or swallow me like Superman III's horrible computer?
Hello, Dantra, always hate?
Hello DQ - no, not today, I took my meds.
It's Wednesday!
I had a few days of rest.
That was cool.
Last weekend I went to the beer and cider party in Nottingham.
It was brothel.
I managed to taste 19 different beers, Wobbly Weasel being one of my favorite.
I was pleasantly surprised by the mix of people there, there were only fanatics of CAMRA (not to be confused with the fanatics of the camera).
Driving on the return Sunday was really hard.
On Monday night we went to a buddy's grandfather to play the nine card brag.
Thanks to a real chance of beginner I was able to go with several decent things.
I hope that if I get 95 years old, I'll be as alive as he is.
Last night I went to a chic cocktail bar in Farringdon.
One of my drinks came in with a slice of lard on it.
I admire M.
Read some Buddha and you will understand how wrong you are, dear Christian.
That said, without wanting to upset you, I think you're getting a little away from the subject.
This famous totality, it prohibits searches for the Jihâdists at the exit of the mosques.
She immediately reports on arms trafficking.
Either we have big eyes open like Meddeb and Taia or Boubaker either we have big eyes closed.
We have to choose.
It's not by keeping our eyes closed that we access the light.
Forgive me, dear Christian, but once again, you are making a monumental counter-sense: all the representative authorities, organizations or associations, whether Muslim or non-Muslim, having formally condemned the IS and its crimes, the French, Muslim or not, have nothing to add to these unanimous official convictions.
Who says no consent.
The problem is that people like you first view them as Muslims, Arabs or Africans.
Not like French.
Unfortunately, dear Kentoc'h Mervel, doubt exists for everyone.
As I said a thousand times, some doubt the approval by the Jewish French of the Israeli massacres in Gaza, but it would be stupid and indecent to accuse them a priori and demand that they manifest publicly to prove to the rest of French society that it is wrong to doubt them.
This principle is in my view the negation of the Republic and can only contribute to criminalizing French society.
If there is no doubt, so much as to say.
Who doesn't say a word, but what?
Consent to a proximity with IE or IE conviction.
Silence is very practical, it is the main weapon of those who want to care for goat and cabbage.
Your position is intellectually honest but pragmatically untenable.
Alex Salmond predicted that Scotland could "revenge" the parties represented in Westminster because a huge gap developed between their proposals for decentralization and what they promised on the eve of the referendum on independence.
Cameron must be petrified to the idea of losing all these seats in Westminster...
Cameron must be laughing.
What are these threats?
The Conservatives are completely involved in Scotland as there is no seat.
They can do what they want in full electoral impunity.
I don't think even Cameron is stupid enough to believe that the Labour losing seats in Westminster for the benefit of the SNP is a good long-term thing for him and the Conservatives.
Who will shed a tear for the Labour Party.
They will be completely eliminated in Scotland by the SNP and UKIP that will cut their heads off in the north.
Ed Miliband joined the "PROMISE" thinking he was saving his party but not realizing that he signed the death sentence of his Scottish MPs.
No wonder some Labour MPs are asking their leaders to account.
If the SNP wins 20-25 seats and there is no majority in parliament, even if the seats do not come from the Conservatives, they will then be in a very good position to negotiate any coalition and they will be able to force both the Conservatives and the Labour to do what they promised for maximum decentralization.
I think this is more important than that.
Not if the Labour or Conservatives want to be re-elected one day in England.
Circulating 8% pumps to the detriment of 85% is not a super electoral strategy.
In addition, once the Scottish MPs can no longer vote on matters concerning England, the Conservatives will win all votes.
Oh, I think he is.
Cameron may not have much to lose, but Miliband does.
Maggie did it with Ulster's unionists and it worked.
However, he is still in high school to be prime minister in 2015 and since he won the leadership of the Labour Party.
So, basically, these boxes will virtually be behind each reader to look over his shoulder and see what he reads, how he reads, and to the end.
It is the "Life of Others" of East Germany or the KGB applied to the world of FRIC...
Always the same fascination for surveillance techniques.
In the long term, this will have at least a sterilising effect.
I expect the next ticket: Amazon manufactures your book according to your profile and this automatically thanks to an algorithm of its secret!

Strongly stimulating.
Thank you for the article.
As under this system, the management of DRMs is not implemented, I still have the reading of pirated files, public domain books or purchased from some publishers who have the intelligence to offer files without mouchard.
In view of the price I paid for Kobo, it's no regret.
I am ashamed of the widespread abdication of users in the face of the widespread appropriation of their privacy.
In your general public bookstore, you will notice systematically that everyone gives their loyalty card (fn*c, d**itre, etc.).
There are also demanding masterpieces whose opening and completion rates are likely to be disastrous.
For example, James Joyce’s Finnegans Wake.
@Thomas: In the age of Big Data, the data does not really need to be personal to be relevant.
Be careful not to put all the literature in the same container.
The collection of anonymous data when there's a profile...
The harvest is not anonymous.
It is the data published by Kobo that is, not allowing for the identification of readers or authors.
But Kobo has all this information right, him.
There have been so many exaggerated, erroneous and contradictory statements by the Turkish government in recent days that the country seems to be led by a class of mothers full of schizophrenic children under acid.
This is even worse if you take into account Erdogan's religious fundamentalism.
It is interesting that some Erdogan supporters think that Islamist is such an insult that they delete your comment, but not mine. ;-)
Well seen :-P But Turkey doesn't want to shoot a bullet in the foot unless it earns something.
If it attacks ISIS, ISIS will respond, so it's actually shooting a bullet in the foot.
A retired diplomat writes on his blog: "The AP reports that Iran warned the United States that it would be a mistake to seek to overthrow Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad because it would endanger Israel's security.
It is not clear in the article whether Iran sent a serious warning of reprisals or whether it simply advised caution.
This second option is more likely and, in all cases, what really surprises is that today the Iranian and American diplomatic commitment concerns Syria, Israel and the security of the region."
Indian Punchline's reading is strongly recommended to anyone who pays attention to details rather than to traditional media-balanced c*nneries. The short article you link to is important and should be read in keeping in mind the realistic/previous warnings coming from Iran to propose Afghanistan around 1979 - 1980.
Who are these "moderate" who seriously fight the horrible secular Assad and at the same time the perverts of ISIS?
Pipeline politics pushes the world towards the abyss and I would suggest those who refer to "moderate" non-existent to pay more attention to facts and alternatives before sending the children of others to the Third World War.
"It is even worse than that if you take into account Erdogan's religious fundamentalism" Are there other religious fundamentalists in power in the Middle East?
I've got one in mind.
It would require a Nuremberg trial for the Armenian genocide committed by the Turks.
Should I?
Do you realize that neither criminals, nor victims, have any chance of being alive yet?
A little late for that, mate...
Wouldn't criminals be barely old now, like, 120 years old?
It's a little late for that, isn't it?
Particularly concerning the Triumvirate of the CUP that planned and directed the genocide, Talaat and Djemaal killed just after World War I by vengeance by the Armenians, and Enver killed by the Bolsheviks in a crowded place in Central Asia at about the same time, when he went there dreaming of founding a Turkish empire there.
What a delusion!
An impressive mastery of the sophistication of the fatal slope, but apart from that, we seek in vain contact with the real.
How many clichés without argument.
The fetus will always hear a heart beating even in a mother's womb.
Lesbian couples may simply be a child's desire and not a desire to be accepted.
Hetero couples are also sterile.
What about the kids!
What a shame to name them as future psychological imbalances.
One day, they will have the age to defend themselves, to say that they are happy to live, to earn their lives and to pay for the retirement of this lady (?)
The GPA is probably a provisional "solution" in the evolution of the medicine that our world knows.
She doesn't date today.
Many women have brought and put into the world children who were not their husbands.
It's still like this, we're done like this...
The important thing about this is that this practice is framed so that the "marketing" of the body is limited.
But aesthetic surgery, cosmetics aren't they as much body merchandise? !
Anaronik Fareinheit...
It is certainly more elegant to grow a good in distant countries via the internet and Pay Pal than to endow his responsibilities and or avoid scandal in another century near his own home without yelling at that time on all the roofs! ...
These practices were no longer done in the name of the church! ...
There are only Christians and believers who refuse these practices ...
Nevertheless, the exploitation of the bodies is a real problem.
Oh shut up, this man is passionate about something.
At the end of the 1970s in the Midlands, I only saw this from a distance.
I had to go there the day because I didn't have the right to go to the night!
But if you like it and you listen to music - this music today always touches you so much.
I don't know why there are so many disparaging comments here about what Paul Mason says, maybe they're posted by people who've never been cool, even for a few years!
I believe that in the sports section there is an article on the football that awaits your comments.
Super article, very true.
Since Tony Parson's film, there is a shortage of reports that really reflect the reality of Northern England's culture.
Nothing surprising that Paul Mason had grasped the social and political context, he understood things well.
The Northern soul still lives, but it has been vamped by capitalism and today it is essentially a phenomenon of surface.
That said, you can get an ear if you are in the London region in November: 99psoul will once again spend soul vinyls, including full of Northern soul, on Saturday, November 15 at Betsey Trotwood in Farringdon.
I too thought "always the same story," but here's a very well written and well thought-out little article.
Your critics really need to be more constructive.
Super article.
I loved your documentary.
I guess you're glad you escaped Newsnight.
Last train to Wigan from Victoria/Exchange and get off at Wallgate.
By swallowing pills.
Whatever the train station before Wigan was Ince, 15 minutes walk from Wigan after buying a ticket for the stop after Victoria!
The beginnings of the Northern Soul scene are described in an excellent episode of the George Gently Police Series entitled Gently Northern Soul, which took place in Newcastle in 1968.
Business is becoming increasingly poisonous.
The Palestinians do not have a partner for peace.
Unfortunately, Netanyahou never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity to negotiate peace.
@Jonathan: Netanyahou does not seek peace as he wants to continue to occupy-colonize (in addition, it was also the case of Rabin).
It is clear that Rabin, Netanyahu and their voters have all preferred occupation-colonization to peace.
He took off his clothes, laid them on the rock, and went into the water.
An Israeli had stolen them from him.
The Israeli representative was angry and said, "What are you talking about?
The Israelis weren't even there at the time!"
The Palestinian representative (UN) smiled and added: and now that things are clearly established
Israel and the majority of its population have no confidence in the bipolar government of the Palestinian authority and will not lower custody ...
That it displeases the anti-Israeli is evidence, it is not the aim sought ...
Anti-Zionist: But I answered you, I translate: the global geopolitical report ...
And it's always been like this since the policy is globalized...
Avoidance, avoidance...
In the Israeli-colonialist conflict, for the creation of the Palestinian state, it certainly continues!
For the creation of Israel you do not answer.
What force report has allowed the creation of Israel?
Anti-Zionist: the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is still a force report today!
Do you doubt it ?!!! ...
Besides, it's not just about Russell Brand, but the Guardian's reporters seem to have a hard time going beyond anything he doesn't have to say.
Much of what he says is just pseudo-chomskyists who write nothing else.
This proves that you don't understand what Russell Brand says, or what Noam Chomsky says.
It's just a series of personal attacks and innuendos (my 13-year-old daughter likes her, which would mean it's a matter of immaturity).
A really vicious burden, with just a suspicion of awareness that Russell Brand is telling certain truths, maybe truths that one prefers not to think about.
Hang on, this feeling is going to be more and more widespread!
I can understand why Brand horrifies some: he sometimes speaks pretentiously and after all the absurdities of tabloids he actually gives the impression that he is a beginner populist, but all this story of not voting has been completely misinterpreted by me.
The general consensus seems to be that he tells people just not to vote and rather cross their arms and to ignore the whole political process - but if you look at Paxman's interview and other articles/videos he has posted, he says that once every five years he votes only for Labour or Conservatives (or Lib Dems I suppose) and limit the democratic commitment to this is completely useless, the two parties (at slightly different degrees) ruling primarily in favour of particular interests, multinational companies and rich ones, At no time he does he say simply to ignore politics completely because these parties do not govern on our behalf: he insists that rather than just vote and disconnect for five years, people should become much more politically active at the local level, organize movements, demonstrations, petitions, nothing and try to influence politics from this.
I do not say that I necessarily agree with his solution (because I think that being active politically by presenting his requests may go hand in hand with voting, since politicians are the ones who will change their mind if they really risk losing the elections), but it is furious to see all these condescending answers that say that this idiot who makes Jesus tell young people not to take the trouble to vote and just hope that everything will be better because it is really distorting his arguments.
Its solution is extremely questionable and it would be good if people debated what it really says rather than simply label it as irresponsible and put aside the concerns of him and a large number of people left alone.
Yes, thank you.
The thing about voting has been completely distorted.
The futility of dragging a ballot in a ballot box every 5 years makes me deeply upset because my vote really counts for nothing.
I want more referendums, electronic voting, direct democracy and Members who report locally to their voters.
In addition, I challenge the idea that Russell Brand's words are not his own (written by others).
He is smart enough to have his own words and ideas, even though they are strongly influenced by the type of thinkers and anti-establishment university students derived from the counter-culture that Suzanne would like to combine under the label " pseudo-chomskyist bliveves".
I am rather convinced that in a debate he would succeed in convincing Suzanne.
Maybe that's what the Guardian could do, that Suzanne would do like Polly Toynbee and interview Russell on a porch, with even the head hobbles added to the assembly!
Like Max Keiser, who initially attacked Russell but ended up becoming one of his fans and inviting him into his show, it's too easy to attack him without really understanding where he wants to come from.
He draws in a political discourse that has existed for generations, but which has been marginalized by traditional media - including Guardian - for generations.
This "float" is especially evident in my view that the intellectual debate has been no longer held in the RDVs of history where trade historians have become minorities and where the exchanges of specialists have been depleted for the benefit of condensed science Po-like loan-to-think for press records.
For my part I had seen in the intellectual attitude of Pierre Bourdieu as well as that of Michel Foucault, a need to take a guilty, emissary goat.
They develop each other's very rational reasonings, but this rationality is based on these emissary goats that are the key to their thinking.
Instead, I believe that for Foucault the state was indispensable as guilty.
This is a very archaic thought, the sacrificial thought, which is also the magical thought.
We solve the problem of reporting to each other by eliminating it.
There is an anarchist slope, neo-lib and / or / libertarian (of the two terms the second marks a hardening of the desire to eradicate the state, the first knowing going to seek the state's help for its markets) within the meaning of at least state / not state at all at Foucault.
The old dream of the base that organizes itself beautifully.
His thought is built on the guilt of the state: without this guilt she does not stand.
Who says guilty, said elimination, murder, sacrifice.
This is not a position against the three intellectuals cited here.
Not even a support.
The totalitarian left remembers the good old time, that of his god then, Stalin, the little father of the peoples.
Oula, you may have read a chouya too quickly if you have taken the texts of Foucault on the Iranian revolution for an apology of Khomeiny.
Today even Pierre Manent would no longer have fun attacking Michel in this way...
Gauchet reflects deeply on the contemporary individual and the collective, on the difficulty posed by the accession mechanism in our advanced liberal societies.
Whether we agree or not with him, he's an original and respectable thinker.
See this cabal orchestrated by hard-left human sciences researchers who do not support the transition from allegiance to their mantras, is quite resilient.
Narcissism and the authoritarianism of these people are boundless.
An important point to add seems to me to be the posture of these "rebels", which is only intellectual and theoretical.
The treatment of Chinese and other "yellows" that I have witnessed in Russia is absolutely incredible.
You didn't have the pleasure of hearing our Australian friends about it, then.
And where was it in Russia, that a Russian could meet a Chinese and have a personal opinion?
I don't remember when I saw a Chinese for the last time.
In London and they were nice to me when they learned I was Russian.
In Russia here - in the 1990s the last time, in a market.
The Chinese think the same way about Whites!
My family lives in Australia after coming from Hong Kong and Guangzhou a long time ago, in the middle of the 20th century, and I still hear some of them say violently anti-whites.
My dad's not happy his older daughter got out with a white guy.
I also believe that attitudes have changed in Russia since the 1990s and especially in recent years: they are becoming more and more rich, prosperity is spreading outside the larger cities, and thanks to this prosperity people travel abroad and see how others live.
As I have been told, the Russians mainly have prejudices against temporary workers without qualifications originating in the Caucasus and Central Asia, who work in trades and in areas where they are very likely to be exploited by their employers or faced with high crime and violence.
Although I lived on the banks of the river Ienissei, in Siberia.
Unfortunately, I heard Australians' opinions about Chinese and Aboriginal people.
It's really strange that a stranger tells me that I don't support the Chinese, while I met two in my life (one of them abroad), I didn't keep bad memories of them, everyone was brave and, in fact, those in London were very kind that's the only reason I remembered they were Chinese.
Otherwise we don't remember who we meet, everyone stands up, how they remember who they were.
You know what's weird?
That you and the other Russian here spoke of Chinese as a kind of unique fascination, as if they were an attraction in a zoo.
And yet you always go out with the so-called White.
How many Chinese men are with Blanches, by comparison?
None, because there is a lot of chance that the parents of these Blanches would physically assault them.
No measure of impartiality of justice.
However, it is the mother of all battles and justice in France remains manipulated by groups strongly marked on the left as the union of the judiciary...
@Marabout: pardon, but the judiciary are frankly marked a right.
When at the judiciary union, it represents only 25% of the judges.
If a measure of its bias can be taken based on the relativity of law enforcement in the courts, it commands to remove two obstacles.
He of the observer's political vision as of the factual interpretation of the magistrate.
The law's obligation to refocus the assessment on the fundamentals remains.
The measure of its non-compliance in all judicial acts of judges, including prosecutors, forces a distinction between the error and bias of the magistrates.
It would be futile to claim that acts of justice were not divided among these three groups.
The claim and ignorance do not fall under objective analysis.
What if all this is not analysed, then how can we say that justice is improving in France?
If it is only through statistics that implicitly reveal that it starts from very low.
The previous preamble allows the following to be included in the third ratio.
The one from corruption* from the judiciary.
A sensitive subject in proportion to the power of nuisance* which is given to the judicial institution capable of such a heresy.
The area considered is that of spoliation* of heirs committed up to fraud in proceedings* by successor genealogists mandated by notaries.
This profession earns EUR 150 million a year and benefits from the coverage* provided by the quasi-judicial impunity* of the French notariat.
For the purpose of understanding their mechanism, a part of it was reported in the comments following the first publication.
In addition to the above-mentioned statistical improvement* moderated by the previous commentary, the judicial institution has produced, in many disputes between the genealogist and the heirs who are reluctant to have themselves poliated, a whole set of jurisprudence contrary to all laws favourable to the heirs.
Is not the presentation of European statistics ignoring these types of rational criteria an elaborate form of lies?
Definitely totally prohibitive prices.
Still equipment to destroy the disabled.
You can say that, but my brother has one of these all-ground tricycles, built to measure his size and weight and it really allowed him to enjoy the outdoors like never a normal wheelchair, with wheels and tyres in the wind, couldn't.
As we say, tastes and colors...
Tankchairi looks like Jeremy Clarkson could make up for a challenge in Top Gear.
The Tankchair looks EPIC.
I think Whill's inventor never had to clean a dog's crutch on a kennel.
I'm sure my sister would love the whole tricycle, but it's just too expensive.
The long-distance ultra wheelchair would be perfect for a disabled person with a penchant for the longboard.
Here are hills that they would like.
Prices actually look high, but there are really people who put that kind of price into a bike, so "you see."
The whole tricycle seems particularly useful to me.
Not everyone with disabilities is poor, however.
Many of them have reasonable insurance at their disposal.
Only if they have become disabled.
The thing is that the wheelchair market is a niche, so they can afford to practice high prices for things they know properly that we need.
You can't really say that Whill is minimalist.
This is an example of excessive design.
Unfortunately it's just a draft, it's not supposed to be made.
I am content that the "long distance" wheelchair does not reach the market, because apparently there is no way to drive this damn thing.
Nearly 20,000 houses were destroyed by the Israeli army in Gaza during intensive bombings of densely populated residential areas.
Two million human beings have been prisoners of the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007 (Israel is the occupying power of the Palestinian territory, not Egypt).
Half are children and young people under the age of 18.
Eight-year-olds have lived their entire lives under Israeli blockade!
Unique situation in the world, unacceptable situation, illegal situation as well, since this blockade imposes a “collective punishment” on all civilians in Gaza.
" Entrepreneurs working on their projects divert a little bit of their cement into the black market " ...
That's not wood language, it's concrete and the lady's army...
The references are here to support an argument or fact.
Anti-Zionist...
The good cement goes to the tunnels!
There's the black market, it's certain, and it's recognized.
Two million human beings have been prisoners of the Israeli blockade in Gaza since 2007.
Unique situation in the world, unacceptable situation for anyone who has a heart and moral sense.
The USA has a well-kept field: Saudi Arabia.
Morsi didn't have the time to rule because the dictatorship (supported by whom you know) excluded him!
Don't forget that after he got up, Morsi had restored the blockade!!!
And I'm an Westerner, so I approve...
Jonathan...
The Block is Israeli-Egyptian ...
The children of Gaza live in an underground fortress, built against the population that has chosen its masters!
Having a boat is a lot of work, Aleks.
I hope you thought it through.
Couchsurfing is much cooler than Airbnb.
It is the very definition of the economy of sharing, not for profit.
Many are only looking for a one-night shot at Couchsurfing.
So it's getting paid (or at least hoping for it) in another way.
It's always a lot less expensive than a hotel, if you have to look for the right addresses.
In addition, owners and tenants who are confident often stop using Airbnb and treat directly in cash, thus bypassing Airbnb.
Where is the community in all this.
"What does it put in rent on?"
No problem with the verb, what's the problem with your grammar?
We do not use the verb "to let" in the United States.
The author simply used an American expression.
It's an international newspaper now, in case you hadn't noticed.
It would be better to have the right insurance for the boat, make sure it is 100% in accordance with all the safety rules and ask those who manage channels and rivers for permission to do business activities there (which they will certainly refuse). I have a boat and I tried to see how to rent it (in all honesty) on Airbnb, In short, it is really a nightmare...
Have you thought about the fact that ships can be moved, stolen and repainted, flown, etc.?
The penises are so slow that if someone tried to steal it, it would always be close to where you left it.
Or hijacked by pirates...

Where are you going to tie him up?
No Marine Le Pen is not right!
Populism?
There is no truth other than that which exposes the facts!
Poverty is increasing in France.
More than 150,000 young people leave school without training.
The increase in wealth in the hands of the richest is a reality.
Who's defending who?
Who's defending what?
In 2017 the Mass will be said!
Capitalism is not going to fail!
High finance, speculative, plays with our companies our jobs, with our raw materials, so our purchases, our food, therefore our health care structures, and therefore our institutions.
They are a threat in our daily lives by the same and our money they own..
All this for the benefit of some hyper-mega-obessive money.
Until proof of the contrary, FH said: "My enemy has no name, my enemy has no face, my enemy is finance."
It was in 2012.
In 2014, he appointed Minister of the Economy an old Rothschild bank, history of better defending the interests of bankers, solely responsible for the 2007 crisis.
Was there anyone else who competed?
You call this how: turn his jacket back, lower his pants?
Primary and populist response
Actually, we don't know what Marine Le Pen thinks.
Where did you see that?
Because the Germans refused to rescue the survivors.
I'm not sure Spee really "refused" to rescue survivors.
One aspect of this battle was that none of the parties seemed sure of the enemy's exact strength.
Robert Massie in his book Castles of Steel suggests that Spee quickly left the area because he had received a report indicating a British curative in the area.
The sea was muddy at the beginning of the day; I don't know if it was still the case at the end of the battle?
Similarly, the battle ended after sunset, making any rescue operation more difficult.
Compare this to the next battle, that of the Malouines, where, on the pictures showing survivors being rescued, we see a calm sea and in the middle of the day.
Moreover, the rescuers knew that there were no more German fighters in the area at this stage.
Hmm, it doesn't really correspond to what I remember reading about this battle, so I did a quick search on Wikipedia:
"A certain confusion reigned among the German ships as to the fate of the two sea cruisers, who had disappeared in the dark after the shooting had ended, and a race-and-run began.
The Leipzig lives something in the fire, but as he approaches, he sees that it was only a wreck.
The Nürnberg, slower than the other German ships, joins the battle late and lives the Monmouth, bent and severely damaged but still in motion.
After pointing out its spotlights on the ship's flag, the proposal to go away was refused and it opened the fire, finally flowing the ship.
Without reliable information, von Spee found that the Good Hope had to escape and stopped research at 2215 hours.
Concerned about reports indicating a British curative in the vicinity, he headed north."
So, if that's true, the Germans, in the darkness before the invention of the radar, did not know that a ship had flown, and therefore could not search for survivors.
They also thought that there was a more important cuirass of the Royal Navy in the area that could have seriously damaged them, so in confusion they disengaged to take advantage of their advance.
They were far from their base and Spee was well aware that they should break a path through many Royal Navy ships.
Cradock's sacrifice had already caused them harm and had cost them about half of their ammunition, thus condemning them when they were finally taken.
Several votes are cast at the PMU to request that it be included in the law that a finally convicted elector be therefore definitely ineligible.
This is a courageous position, which would also affect the left-wing elect of course.
But nooon, it's a joke.
FOR THIS IDEA, I PROPOSAL A ENTRY TO THE COUNCIL OF MAJSTERS
When is the ban on trade unions in the already protected sectors?
How long will this distortion of equality between citizens be tolerated?
Maintained by politicians whose vision of society is limited to these sectors, they are always ready to love themselves who will take advantage of their immeasurability to hinder the actions of true policies, who are really trying to move things, not the beautiful speakers whose immobility is as much as they need.
I met them in the subway around noon with their little signs "bows for justice" they came from the province and did not make the difference between Bercy and POPB.
It supports the existence of politicized unions whose members place the enormous power they hold in the service of their party.
It would not defend the same theses if right-wing, even extreme right-wing, trade unions designated as the target of the personalities on its board and led them against a legal-media war.
Your claims are completely free.
If, at present, the right fails the court's news, it is simply that it has committed facts that are relevant to it!
There is no example of a left-wing personality that has had so much to do with the Justice but all those who have been the subject of his attention have not been treated favorably.
On the other hand, it should be recalled that the left-wing judiciary union is not the only judiciary union and it is a minority union.
Let a minister support trade unions with such commitment show how useful they can be.
@MCR The union you cite is perhaps minority among the magistrates, but its influence is great at Chancellery, it is not a secret.
The question now arises whether the "mission" of certain judges is not more dirty than to instruct.
@gus - You should be satisfied, the MS is minority.
What are you complaining about?
@Pivoine: You forget that magistrates are not civil servants like others: they are the only ones who have the power to impeach and imprison each other.
Jade Goody?
What if none of the participants ever came back?
Hello, Katie Waisel.
I think even the weakest of glory realizes that X-Factor can only mean the end of a career, so I would be surprised if someone accepted their offer.
Many have used it as a springboard to start a successful career.
The One Direction fills the stadiums around the world.
Others then sold a lot of records or left for West End.
Popstars, the precursor of all these programs, launched Chreyl Cole, who is in fact part of the jury.
Even ABBA, Olivia Newton-John, Céline Dion, Cliff Richard, all took part in Eurovision as well as many others.
While others such as Frank Sinatra and the rest participated in competitions in the United States.
In the 1970s and 1980s, New Faces and Opportunity Knocks launched most of the British television light entertainment stars.
Of course, some fell into oblivion.
But this is what happens to most stars who do not participate in the competitions anyway.
Rare are those who, after one tube, succeed in making others.
However, most singers/groups can best hope for three albums and a best of.
Yeah, but now Cole, whatever his name is, has only fans in the United Kingdom.
His celebrity comes in part from his wedding with a footballer who breathes through his mouth.
Most Americans know who Jeremy Clarkson is.
can only mean the end of a career
In fact, it's more likely to lead to a career than the typical rock ride, even if in your dreams you think that all guitar nerds who smoke from the grass in their father's garage and balance three agreements on a poem level primary school will surely become stars and the only question is how much they want to touch before they even release an album.
And worse than ridiculous: it establishes a completely artificial distance between the Western public and the peoples studied – a distance that turns fast enough to racism, because sacralist ethnologists present these distant peoples as infinitely superstitious and petris of ritual bigotery, while most of their ways are strictly equivalent to ours and inspired, like ours, practical considerations daily.
Unless you interpret unwisely in the opposite direction.
Either, but rather than saying that the drum is devoid of sacred character, is it not better to admit that our Marianne and our Molières are not also somewhat sacred?
Our bias is as reminded of seeing the sacred as a sort of well-defined object and circumscribed to the religious sphere.
This article is very interesting whatever it is.
It's the ephemeral deco to furnish the void.
Nothing more.
Great article, thank you.
The recent Pantheonization of the Republic's illustrious figures is an illustration that the feeling of sacred still lives.
Who still believes in the interpretations of archaeologists!
Any other discipline would throw at orcies interpretations not at all scientific that last a Mandarin's life, rarely less.
When's a comparative criticism of disciplines to laugh a little?
Because what is good for archaeology also applies to the interpretations given by other disciplines.
This would bring a healthy dose of modesty.
Your contempt for archaeologists is completely unjustified!
It is through them that we constantly discover treasures, valuable testimonies to reconstitute history, understand societies, and the example here of comparative archaeology is exciting.
This method is not very old and before the archaeologists relied on their "instinct" and knowledge, and could be mistaken.
Today we have such powerful technical and scientific means that the interpretation of the searches is better but can always be questioned by other discoveries!
There we are in the middle (and old) polemic on shamanism advanced by prehistoricist Jean Clottes (see his book "The Shamans of Prehistory", especially the increased re-edition of scientific controversy, published in the editions La Maison des Roches).
Thank you for this very informative article
Do straight men like anal sex?
For you, Mike, I could put myself in it.
So it's over with us?
I don't really understand why can't we continue to three?
This paper is supposed to be serious, made for adults.
Do you really need to fall into the sink?
No, but we're not against a play on it.
We couldn't watch a musical comedy up there instead, it would be too gay!
We could expect that kind of comment from you.
Looks like Mary Whitehouse came back from the dead.
Since your test offer is almost finished, may I suggest you move to the Catholic Times.
I'm sure you'll feel more at home.
He prefers mikedow.
May I suggest that we all look for a newspaper that pays true journalists, brave, so that they write about the Middle East, Ebola, etc. to their risks and risks.
It's more than just making a run with those puerile ass jokes.
Not very clever.
Go away then.
If these " puerile ass jokes" shock you so much, you don't have to participate, do you?
Do you also know that this paper also covers the Middle East and Ebola and that it is entirely possible to do both and publish an article on anal sex?
Is this the subject that shocks you, or the fact that people laugh at it?
However, we find the video crash amateur on the net...
video crash amateur on the net... ??
If the FOM has chosen not to show these images, it is only to protect its interests in no case those of the pilot.
If the FOM had wanted to protect the pilots, it would have been safe because at the time or another vehicle (e.g.), it would have entered the circuit.
But it was necessary to finish quickly before the typhoon that we knew it was coming, but for which the FOM did not consider it right to advance the departure time (television right, pub, money...).
But apart from that, they protect the pilots well.
Well, of course, I also share that opinion.
But there is also that if the very British FOM enters the SC, it will allow Nico Rosberg to have a chance of defeating the English that was leading then...
You're letting go of this blog my dear Dayrton.
But it's okay, I've got a little time to get all your shit out of here.
No, just don't.
There have been lots of F1 conspiracy, but never one that puts commissioners in danger of death for a distant story of a pilot's chance of winning at the expense of another.
It's not the FOM that comes out of safety because it's the FIA.
Size shade.
In view of amateur images, the absence of an image mainly allows the AIF to avoid embarrassing questions of the type: How is it that the Commissioner acts a green flag in full intervention and continues to do so after the accident (see the full video after the accident)
No, it is not because the video is considered too violent that the AIF blocks the images of the accident but because one of the Commissioners clearly acted a green flag, signs that the race can resume normally and that one is more under the regime of a yellow flag.
Some comments show a dark ignorance of F1.
Yes, dear Etienne, the race is no longer under the regime of yellow flag AFTER the place of the accident, from which the green flag stirred.
That's the usual procedure.
The position of commissioners just downstream of the accident (as the case may be 10 metres as well as 100 metres after the accident) shakes the green to tell the pilots to resume a normal look.
Sensationalism sells pubs.
Before I thought the media were an integral part of the government's "patriotic" propaganda offensive, but I'm afraid that, ultimately, it's just for money.
And sex, let's not forget sex, fear of having no sex life, pub and media are good for selling us things that are supposed to improve our sex life.
The information does exactly the same thing.
Making the buzz with information we don't really need to worry about is just to keep people scared so we can keep controlling them.
"When the tabloids cough about Ebola, we all catch fear" It should be "derailing", not "touching".
Given the medical reference, “tossing” is much better said in this context than “to derail”.
I wonder if all the people who are running out of Ebola could start spreading by air do they realize that they now believe in evolution?
You're giving them too much honor.
They probably think that this is the end of the world and that Ebola is just one of the signs of the approaching apocalypse.
Ebola is the Antichrist!
You're confusing Ebola and Murdoch...
Super article, thank you!
A short and concise article that ridicules this pseudo-journalism abject beautifully and firmly.
That made me laugh.
I'm depressed that the media are talking about most things with this optimism backwards.
The goal is once again to keep us sufficiently frightened and anxious (without going to hysteria) so that the government can get us to take off when it needs it.
I believe it is perfectly logical that, if we have to go through a budgetary emergency in the absence of any crisis, a terrorist emergency in the absence of any attack, why not have an Ebola crisis in the absence of any evidence?
It seems that this government is trying to save us from crises that he has invented himself.
Isn't there something fundamentally problematic about the idea of governing by fear?
Congratulations on this post, and to be still of this world almost 35 years later.
Also at the beginning it must have been horrible, given the context of the 1980s-90s.
I'm bluffing, living with the certainty of going through it for years .....
Perfectly useless testimony.
As always when we talk about science.
Not only are the testimonies useless: taken alone, they cannot serve as scientific material.
But they have a negative influence on the objective appreciation of the facts.
@trafic: Testimonials cannot be used as scientific material.
This may be the reason why it is not possible to ask questions to patients in psychiatry when reliable observations are made from relatives.
My psychiatric file mentions that my psychiatric mother explains that I was educated telepathically by her mother-in-law.
This is therefore an objective symptom.
When I say it's bullshit, it's a subjective testimony without any importance.
Ah, because the attestation of a fact (= here this testimony, which attests to the contamination and effectiveness of new treatments) is useless in a scientific approach?
What do you base your research on, then?
About ghosts?
Are you putting the same level of fantasist theories and facts (= giving rise to verifiable testimonies)?
"Resilience": the word bidon adopted by the grandmothers, fans of J-L Delarue, who take themselves for great psychologists after reading D'ansembourg.
@Jim: There are plenty of empty buzzwords in the psyches.
Cyrulnik struck us with "resilience".
As a great scientist, Cyrunik, I hope he will have given us a reliable scale of measurement to quantify it, this famous resilience.
I wonder if the Air Sentinels could all save us from Farage and company??
Doesn't that make you think of Team America?
Seriously, it's not a good idea to emerge the Sentinels from the air...
So why?
It was a great series and it seems that those who see it are aware of it!
Let us therefore leave our salvation to the Almighty who can perform miracles.
But how are they gonna get the kids to hang up?
The only solution that comes to mind is the mood like pipi-caca, which would kill the series.
It was already a series for children.
The kids were hanging up.
Oh, because it's a series for kids?
UKIP works for the Mystery.
So keep your Team America.
Still in Supermaritalization?
It will not be the same if we do not see the sons and that the animation is well done. :-)
I look forward to seeing this (though being an adult), but I hope that this will give the idea to a chain of recasting the old.
The series almost never stopped being broadcast here in Australia; at least 40 years ago we had episodes of one hour on Saturday and Sunday at 06h.
Since the arrival free digital television a few years ago, it is on one of the second-order commercial channels and you can always see it at these times.
And in addition, the half-hour episodes are now at 05:30, Monday through Friday!
Okay, I'm probably a 60-year-old "sad" guy, but I don't watch this series every day!
There is no "Mount of the temple" in or under the mosque of the Esplanades!!!
Radical Zionists invented this to give themselves political legitimacy to colonize Jerusalem.
Moreover, all Israeli excavations below and around the mosque of the Esplanades for several decades have not been able to find anything.
The mountain of the temple if it exists is elsewhere.
Can it be Argentine??
This mountain is not sought for the simple reason that it is the hill on which the mosques have been built.
Its summit, or Dome of the Rocker, rises in the middle of Omar mosque.
For Muslims, Muhammad went to paradise from this rock.
For the Jews, it is Mount Moriah where Abraham failed to sacrifice his son Isaac.
Since it was taken and contextualized, there is no propaganda, but information, dear K1K1.
Israel also has its extremists, it is good to remind them regularly, and unfortunately they are relayed to the government (Naftali Bennet, Avigdor Liebermann, and even Netanyahu, the latter had accepted the plan at 2 states, and has continuously overcame it!).
It is also good to show the extent to which the annexation of Jerusalem is not a peaceful fact.
Can God recognize his people?
The shortest Jewish joke: "God be praised!"
In order to boast tourism in Israel, we are often shown to be half-dressed, orange young naïdes on the beach.
Reality is, as usual, quite different from what advertising shows us, as can be seen in the photo that illustrates the article.
It's a little scary, though.
And this photo is a wonderful work of propaganda!
Too bad that the photographer of Reuters did not take pictures of the hundreds of Palestinians authorized to enter the Temple Mount and who prefer to call down the Jewish faithful on the ground, praying to the Wall for complaints.
@Mat, If this photo bothers you, it's right, it's not the newspaper, nor the photographer, but this woman and the ideology she conveys that you must condemn.
This system is not tenable and will end in tears.
The only way to end this system is revolution.
Since the economy appears to be drifting away, large companies have benefited greatly from their employees.
They have succeeded in convincing their employees that they have the chance to have a job and that they cannot afford to increase wages, while at the same time and without hiding, they have given even greater pay to the small elite at the summit.
You are right, it is not tenable, but it will only change in this country when workers are really speaking with one voice.
Instead of laughing and moaning when someone else makes the strike, support them, show some solidarity and understand that their strike is not only about their problems, but also shows your employer that we don't fuck people up with impunity.
Unless we abandon democracy, in which case it is tenable.
I totally agree.
The only thing you have forgotten is that British and American companies have sold our industry and now our services to countries where social and environmental conditions are the worst.
Like China and India.
This can't all end well.
It's because we're in democracy that kept it.
Did you vote for the PTCI?
The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (PTCI) aims to increase the profits of companies held by these people by short-circuiting national governments through secret courts.
This seems incredible, but that is exactly what the mechanism for resolving disputes between investors and States (ISDS) proposed by the agreement is for.
The Greens are against this project and try to alert people about the unimaginable damage this agreement will have on our lives.
It's only recently that we start talking about it in the media: Independent Guardian World Development Movement So look at these links and you'll understand what's being negotiated in your back.
Didn't Churchill say "blood, sweat and tears"?
This is what makes an excellent return, while digital money has no reason to fall and even less to grow on trees.
The next weak link will probably be the car market.
This gentleman was right, in the 18th century there were unions in all the regiments
In the very Catholic French army, there is a sacrificial dimension.
Let it (at last, its officers, the others, nobody knows anything) believe the safe of the eternal values of France, and it will fight and shut its mouth.
And then with the decline of the country, globalization, Europe, the crisis of values, briefly: the dissolution of the idea of the nation, having this little relic, is comforting.
Even though for her, it's increasingly uncomfortable...
You still lack the union of married men, singles, married women, singles, lost dogs and I don't know what else
If you don't write the French correctly, I'm syndicating.
You're warned, it'll be your fault.
For the defence of category interests, there are already enough protected professions with trade unions, which has created a breakdown of equality with other citizens.
We are asked not to laugh about the fear of a public servant's risk.
We can very well imagine a system that ensures a certain freedom of expression without trade unions, or then without the right to strike as in Germany, in return for the protection they enjoy.
If not for disaster insurance.
And with the wagons that are being prepared, the government welcomes this.
What security are you talking about?
Ignorance indeed...
Ignorance for ignorance Sybille I was alluding to the military and other officials, since this is the subject commented here...
Let us delete "through its delegates" in Article 8 of the preamble to the 1946 Constitution.
It will become: "8.
Every worker participates in the collective determination of working conditions and business management".
This is absolutely essential with the disruption of information power.
And yet you have probably read and commented on a specific article entitled "The Great British Bake Off Review". ????
Wait, the section was there, it was empty.
I thought we had to start the conversation.
Anyway, it's Joffrey's wedding that I looked at, and I can tell you that some of them have been well seasoned.
In the episode of Joffrey's marriage we have one of the best moments (someone cheating: it was wine) in the history of television.
Also, from the pie mmmh...
Game of Thrones!
I love GBBO!
This is the second time that, strangely enough, the show ends with a victory of the worst baker; no one has done such "bom, here's my fucking cake now eat it and bow down before your master" !
Maybe the extra pressure of friends and parents outside finally had an effect on them?
In previous weeks, all these outside persons were kept out.
And there is also this idea of "playing security, there is always next week" that disappears last week.
I like cooking, but I don't think I'm getting into this.
I am grateful to those who do it and thus offer us super entertainment and motivates us to try new things.
Forward for GBBO 2015!
I agree, last year's challenge, the wedding cake, was absurd.
Professionals usually put days to do them and they had to brigade one in 3-4 hours.
The three challenges were really difficult to start, I don't know how they chose a winner.
In Luis, the only true flaw they could have found was the base a little dry (even if I agree with Hollywood to say that the green ice on Richard's mill did not give up, anyway Richard had already lost at that time).
I must admit that several of the challenges in this series seem somewhat artificial because of the time allocated.
There is also cancer that looks, with solar wind blows.
We're definitely doing it right now.
A bad time for humanity, we hope.
You confuse solar wind and ultraviolet rays.
UV is mainly blocked by the ozone layer that is formed precisely by the impact of residual solar wind particles and UV.
So even if the magnetic field was weakening, there would not be enough solar wind to "hate" the ozone of the stratosphere.
There would be even more, and therefore less UV and "cancers".
Fortunately, the ozone layer does not block the UV.
They have a lot of useful functions you don't suspect.
If we are limited to humans they are interested in allowing us to have bones (vitamin D synthesis), to heat us (less than infrared), to modulate our immune system and, it seems, to improve our morals.
The ozone layer blocks the carcinogenic UVCs and allows UVA and most UVB to pass.
Do you know that you don't have to be condescending and consider your talker to be a dead end when you post a comment?
Especially for a minor precision that was subjugated in the commentary, which itself intends to show pedagogy.
Without saying that I am a melanoma habit, the UV only accelerates its development.
They don't provoke him.
For proof: not all bronzed persons have melanomas.
Either, when a tubib tells you that you need to avoid the sun and live at the bottom of a cellar, it's better not to listen because UV is necessary to every human.
Excess, on the other hand, is the same as it is: it kills.
But for other reasons.
UV directly causes melanoma.
Can we fold it?
And, more importantly, can we pass it to the mixer?
or pass it to the mixer...
I believe that the majority of those interested in it have found that everything can be folded if sufficient force is applied and the robustness of the iPhone 6 is perfectly acceptable, for the use to which it is intended.
I think the army would need something more resistant and has not yet adopted the iPhone6 as front-line communication equipment.
But for the rest of us,
It's still a good choice.
the majority of those interested in it have found that everything can be folded if sufficient force is applied
Except a Nokia 3310.
More specifically, is it already folded?
We make this joke in every discussion.
I decided to count them.
This is the fourth joke on the fold I read in today's comments.
It's hard to understand how a prototype can be distributed like this.
Before we install specific software, we imagine that the phone has been removed from the main production chain and we can hardly see how it could return to it.
So, hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.....................................................................................................................................................................
The most likely is that it is a production unit on which the iOS was not installed properly and is therefore stuck with the factory test code installed.
I don't know how they do these things at all.
But would they put test software on everyone?
Photographs on Ebay clearly show the lack of FCC or EC logo and the presence of a red prototype connector.
ah l article for bobo par excellence.
We want cheap products and we are surprised that industrialists produce in » industrials' We put forward super u but all the signs and meme the small trade are concerned How to eat good, bio avac 1650€ (average wage in French)?
But to answer your post, if it is possible to eat correctly with a small salary.
After each one is free to put his or her priorities wherever he or she hears it.
For my part, feeding is one.
Go without resentment, I'll kiss you.
It is called Bobos, or rather boboecolos, people who see the world through an ideological "software" that leads them to disconnect from realities.
It's total thought-reason degrouping.
They are experts in gesticulation, for example they claim to save the planet because they have avoided taking a shower.
They are also experts in trufflery, joining the left-caviar, which they sometimes come from, for example by condemning CO2 releases while spending their holidays in the Maldives.
The vast majority of our citizens do not support this mixture of heavy ideology and truffle, nor are you surprised to find criticism about them often.
Waoh, thank you for this complete and exhaustive theory as well as for all associated details (airplane, shower...).
I'd like to be part of it, but I can't find myself there.
The concept is not so complicated.
The boboecolos are monobloc.
Did you understand the concept of left-caviar?
Well, you're able to understand the concept of the boboecolo.
It's the perfect copy with just an ideological nuance.
Classification would be more complicated if we were interested in short-term ecoloquies.
The boboecolo is part of it but represents only the most visible fringe of the ecos because it is the one that infests the media.
Here's a beautiful giraffe.
Apparently, nobody wants to look at this giraffe in front of them.
She's so badly hurt that she looks vaguely like a naked woman.
Chut, you're next to the plate.
We need to be part of the microcosm of art to understand the amazing beauty of the truth of this work.
But you simply don't have any legitimacy to comment because you haven't spent countless decades studying and praising great artists.
The important thing is not the fact that Emin does not know how to draw and always seems obsessed with the same subject.
The important thing is that she has really managed to become fabulously rich and famous with no artistic skills.
That's art.
No, it's pig.
The fact that Emin can't draw
That's not really a proven fact.
Rather, it is an opinion.
Unless the only thing you can appreciate are realistic reproductions of dogs that smoke by playing the billiard.
Judging art can be problematic, but not in that case.
Drawing is much more than just representing the real.
If you're just looking for this, a camera will do the thing.
The author also speaks of Emin's expressionism.
Look again and let the image speak of itself, without comparing it to the kind of drawing you might prefer.
If it's so easy, why don't you do it yourself?
There are still some savings: riding activities, the number of horses of the Republican Guard or the status of generals who are no longer in active service....
L(honesty requires France to reduce its workforce, but as all countries have done, sometimes even more drastically, to begin with Britain.
It's only half encouraging...
The operative without the support, it quickly finds its limits!
A unique approach, when we observe the weaknesses, the shortcomings of our defence tool, especially in the Sahel.
A bad blow for the local authorities concerned, who lose a dimension of their activities, or even part of their history.
Where is the promised sanctification?
@edmond: That's what I said, look elsewhere where to make savings but above all not at home, at home it's really not possible...
This is exactly what you propose to do, look elsewhere where the cage is certain.
Let all those who have sided with little or no military thing dare to come say here, eyes in the eyes that there is no money wasted in this perimeter and this without bursting with laughter...
That the same potion is applied to the public service as a whole and the public finances will be a little better.
And for Josi: really loud: look at the inflation of public jobs in other departments and you will understand why Defense can be a little busy!
Well, yes, the economies that everyone agrees to say we have to do them, do we have to see each other somewhere?
Lack of pot, those on whom it falls moan at murder when it happens at home, the poor dear ones.
It would have to be done, but above all, it doesn't fall on me because in this case, it's a crime and not an economy.
Guignols, come on!
How will closing the Grace Valley weaken our defense tool in the Sahel?
As for local authorities, history repeats itself at each post closure, maternity, hospital, barracks.
But everyone is for the economies of course.
It is strange, a UMP mayor who wants compensation and does not rejoice at savings made in public expenditure.
This article is really the most amazing thing I've ever read!
This embarrassing moment where the first three people who comment make the same bad joke.
It is depressing to have her Facebook thread paraded and to see that 80% of her friends started their status with the phrase "This embarrassing moment."
I think they're going to make a movie.
It will certainly be based on hilarious scenes where someone accidentally falls on his ex on the bus by going to work and only realizes that his skirt has returned to his panties.
It's not embarrassing, it's totally bullshit.
Not really, I think the author adopts the role of the typical British man to whom we have always learned to bury his emotions and to tighten his teeth.
I'm sure if you're a Kate Bush fan, the announcement of her return to the scene after 25 years of absence was something strong.
Do you realize that your comment is now at the heart of a battle to find out who will have the rights?
I don't have the Internet.
So I don't think I can comment.
Not having a computer.
Oh, my God, I need to see this movie before I die!
I can't believe how much this article is the most incredible thing I've ever read!
Charlie has really shown that he is at the top of the cosmic universe that is satirical journalism!
I'm falling over it!
It is absolutely necessary that I share with all my friends on Facebook and Twitter so that they will finally have enlightenment and discover the incredible brilliance and insurpassable genius that slips from Mr. Brooker's keyboard as a divine glow.
Oh, my God, it was really nothing.
Especially if they are not women or transvestites.
I'm a parasite.
This shows a positive development in democracies: the rise in regional policies and effective associative initiatives.
Until then we have been given the right to save our planet by states that play tartuffs at each meeting to save the planet.
We therefore decide, citizens, to take things into our hands.
With the Commissioner that they planted energy, all these beautiful recommendations flew away ....
Translate: Solar wind farms and wind farms are the Round points of tomorrow.
All financed by the con-tributable.
Please stop this pro-nuclear speech.
Pollution is not limited to CO2.
Radioactivity is much more harmful to its waste and in the event of an accident.
As long as the line is not fully controlled, it is better to limit itself to laboratories.
Renewable energies are our only salvation, provided of course we drastically reduce our consumption.
Renewable electricity to combat CO2 emissions?
France is not concerned at all.
Nuclear electricity is zero CO2 emission to production and epsilon for other stages.
Electricity by renewable wind or PVC is already more GHG on other stages and above all gas, or worse coal as in Germany, to compensate for intermittentness.
Replacing nuclear with renewable wind or PVC would run counter to the fight against CO2.
Christial I do not insult you I am the State Doctor in Physical Sciences 1981 more I have done research in nuclear physics I challenge you to prove the contrary of what I said.
As for what I didn't say it was you who lent me ideas I didn't say anything about Germany anything in fact you didn't answer what I said and how all the people on the right to demolish the interlocutor I never do.
I also cite the conclusion of experts mandated by the German Government: the current renewable energy programme of Germany is an inefficient and ineffective means of reducing GHG emissions and should be stopped.
0 emission if you don't count the extraction of uranium and construction and if you don't count the greenhouse water vapour of less effect than the Co2 it is true to recall two thirds of the energy produced by a nuclear power plant starts in water vapour and a little in the water of the rivers.
I stopped reading when you spoke of Pakistan as a "gender of South Asia" ...!
The last time Pakistan won against Hindustan.
I'm not surprised, most of the Indians who post comments want to read and comment only on articles against Pakistan.
In fact, it shows your state of mind.
It would have been the same if they had called India a giant from South Asia...
I have nothing against the fact that some Pakistani players participate, but having a Pakistani version would be unacceptable.
It would simply open a box of Pandore full of corruption and mafiosis.
As for the ISL, today's opening game was surprisingly interesting, the Athletico of Kolkata imposing 3-0 against Mumbai.
Pakistan still has a lot to do.
In comparison with the billions and billions that India devotes to the IPL cricket and now to football, how could we ever compete with our "noble neighbours"...
The low-cost launcher race is paid cash.
Too bad for such a nice project.
For the incident, the lack of possible design manifests only with a helium too cold.
So maybe we're not in a design defect, but implementation...
unlike arianspace that is a private society, it seems well that sousuz belongs to the Russian state...
And if the rule is the same as here the state is its own insurer..
Maybe they'll pay the satellites in frigates that know..
This is all the more annoying as many media resume the only titles of articles - and many readers retain only those titles .
In total this creates an erroneous impression contrary to the content of the article itself.
The title is not appropriate with you, and it is unfair to question the project while it is just a launch problem.
