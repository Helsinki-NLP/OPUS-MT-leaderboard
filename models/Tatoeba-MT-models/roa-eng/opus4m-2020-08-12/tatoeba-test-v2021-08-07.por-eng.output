Whites: tower on a1, pawn on b6, king on c8. Blacks: pawns on a7 and b7, king on a8, bishop on b8. Whites put the opponent on zugzwang throwing the tower on a6, after which blacks will have only two options: take the tower on a6 or play their bishop on any other house of diagonal b8-h2. In the first case, the whites advance their pawn from b6 to b7 and give kill. In the second situation, the white tower takes the pawn on a7 with the same result.
