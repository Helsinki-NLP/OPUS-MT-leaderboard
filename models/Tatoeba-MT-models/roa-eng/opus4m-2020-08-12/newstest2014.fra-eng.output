Spectacular jump in "wingsuit" over Bogota
Sportsman Jhonathan Florez jumped from a helicopter on Thursday over Bogota, the Colombian capital.
Equipped with a wingsuit (a combination of wings), it passed to 160 km/h above the famous Monserrate sanctuary, located over 3,000 meters high, where many badads had gathered to observe its operation.
A black box in your car?
While U.S. road planners have a hard time finding the money they need to repair the highway infrastructure in decrepitude, many of them are those who are looking for a solution in the form of a small black box that is fixed above the dashboard of your car.
The devices, which record all thousands of cars and transmit information to officials, are at the centre of a controversial attempt in Washington and in government planning offices to remodel the obsolete system of funding for major U.S. roads.
The sector generally without interest in the planning of the major axes has suddenly led to a lively debate and the enlivened alliances.
The libertarians joined environmental groups to pressure the government to use the small boxes to keep track of the thousands you are traveling, and possibly the road on which you are going, and then use the information to draft a tax bill.
The Tea Party is landed.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expresses its concern about the protection of privacy.
And while the members of Congress did not agree to continue, several States did not wait.
They are looking for how, over the next decade, they will be able to switch to a system that allows drivers to pay according to the number of thousands travelled.
Thousands of motorists have already boarded these black boxes, sometimes equipped with a GPS monitoring system, for an experimental tour.
This is truly essential for our nation.
"It's not as if we had the choice," said Hasan Ikhrata, Director General of the Southern California Association of Governments, who expects the state to begin recording the thousands of vehicles travelled by every California motorist by 2025.
There will be some change in the way we pay these taxes.
Technology is here to do it.
The pressure comes from the fact that the country's Highway Trust Fund, funded with the taxes that Americans pay to the pump, is financially dry.
The Americans are no longer buying as much gasoline as before.
Cars can travel more than miles with a gallon.
The federal tax itself, which is 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased for 20 years.
Political men are reluctant to increase the tax, even by 1 cent, while gasoline prices are high.
"The gasoline tax is simply not tenable," said Lee Munnich, a transportation policy specialist at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently installed tracers on 500 cars to test a thousand-dollar payment system.
"It turns out to be the most logical alternative in the long term," he said.
Wonks calls this a cost of use at the mileage.
It is not surprising that the idea seduces the city liberals, since taxes could be used to change driving habits so as to reduce gas congestion and emissions, for example.
California planners are interested in the system as they develop strategies to achieve the objectives set out in the State's ambitious laws on climate warming.
But the representative Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), Chairman of the Transport Committee of the House of Representatives, said that he also considered it the most viable long-term alternative.
The supporters of the free market of the Reason Foundation also appreciate the idea of having drivers pay for the mile.
"It's not just a tax in a big black hole," said Adrian Moore, Vice President of politics at the Reason Foundation.
People pay more directly for their benefits.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. Transport Secretaries who, in a 2011 report, urged Congress to go on the path of payment to miles.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year that would have involved about 10,000 cars.
But the Presidency of the House killed the proposal, responding to the concerns of rural legislators representing voters who must travel many thousands every day to their work or to the city.
However, several States and large cities are making progress on their own.
The most determined is Oregon, which has mobilized 5,000 drivers to carry out the country's most important experience.
These motorists will soon pay to the state the costs of kilometres instead of the taxes on gasoline.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is considering one.
Illinois tries a test on a limited number of trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 agencies involved in road transport in states along the coast is American (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) studies how it could implement change.
The concept is not a universal success.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer motorists recently equipped their car with a device, drivers were concerned that the government could follow their least actions and actions.
"Anxieties about Big Brother and this kind of thing are a big problem," said Alauddin Khan, who runs strategic performance management in the Nevada Department of Transport.
It's not something people want.
From the beginning of the test, the Nevada ACLU warned on its site: "It would be relatively easy to turn these devices into fully located devices."
It is not necessary to build a huge and bulky technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of people's daily movements and arrivals.
Nevada is one of the few States that are now taking steps to find affordable technology that would allow the state to know how many thousands drive a car, but without knowing the exact place or time.
If we can do this, Khan added, the citizens will be more comfortable.
The search for this technology has led some state agencies to use a small California start-up named True Mileage.
Originally, the company was not intended to assist motorists who paid taxes to States.
She sought to get into the emerging market of auto insurance, in which drivers would pay according to their mileage.
But the devices that it tests have taken from the planners of the major axes because they do not use the GPS and provide a limited amount of information, downloaded periodically by modem.
"People will be more inclined to do this if you don't register their speed and locate them," said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
Major errors have been made in the pilot programmes of some States.
There are much less expensive means and much less intrusive methods to proceed.
In Oregon, planners try the experience by offering drivers different choices.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
They may still choose not to have a device at all, preferring instead to pay a package based on the average number of thousands travelled by all residents of the State.
Other States hope to sell the concept to suspicious citizens by allowing devices to do more than enough.
In New York City, transportation officials are seeking to develop a tax system that would also be equipped to pay for parking costs, provide "payment to driving" insurance, and create a set of real-time speed data from other drivers that drivers could use to avoid bottlenecks.
"Car drivers would be encouraged to participate because of the benefits that the system offers them," said an urban planning document.
However, some transport planners wonder whether the whole debate on payment to miles is not just a huge distraction.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission of the San Francisco Bay area, the officials say that Congress could very simply manage the bankruptcy of the Highway Trust Fund by increasing taxes on gasoline.
An additional single or annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid vehicles and others whose vehicles do not consume much gasoline, so that each of them pays its fair share.
"It is not necessary to resort to radical surgery when there is simply a need for aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, the director of legislation and public affairs to the committee.
If we do this, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about protecting their privacy and a lot of other things.
David Bowie: Four Unpublished Listeners Â· Global Voices
The English musician did not end up surprised this year.
Starting from The Next Day, published in January, he concocted a luxury replay scheduled for November 4, with several novels.
Four have already emerged on the Towel.
The announcement of the release of a new album by David Bowie had left everyone in Panto.
On the day of his 66th anniversary, on January 8, 2013, he declared that a new album would be released in March.
After ten years of silence (the last record, Reality, 2003) and too few appearances in public, the English musician proved that he could still be trusted to spark the pop scene.
A party for his fans
Not the surprises, David Bowie had more than one round in his bag with The Next Day.
The Thin White Duke thus planned to re-edit this album on November 4.
For the occasion, he had a real party for his fans.
This edition, entitled The Next Day Extra, will present itself in the form of three albums: the original album, unpublished studio sessions and remixes, as well as a DVD containing the four clips already unveiled.
The Next Day Extra will contain a total of ten additional titles compared to the original album: the three pieces of the Deluxe edition, five songs specially unveiled for the occasion, as well as two remixes.
David Bowie also made the presentations of this beautiful box in a video.
It introduces both the discs, but also the accessories provided with: exclusive photos and pockets, a notebook to share its own impressions, a booklet with the words...
And, above all, it gives a taste of its new Atomic title, typically in the vein of The Next Day, with guitars far ahead and a smartly controlled rock electricity.
Unpublished already listening
But Atomica is not the only title to reveal its charms.
The Informer, Like A Rocket Man, Born In A UFO are also available on the canvas.
The Informer is double-faced: a disturbing intro before a light ride that gradually slows down to give place to a pop ballad.
On Like A Rocket Man, did Bowie want to make a small reference to Elton John's Rocket Man, even to Gravity?
With this playful title, the singer seems in any case in his element when he no longer has his feet on earth.
Space Oddity, next door, was much more serious.
On Born In A UFO, David Bowie once again refers to his strangeness: would it come from another planet?
Guitar riffs, enchanting, give desire to leave the Earth.
Bowie enjoys playing the chameleon with these titles: turn informer, man on board a rocket, potential Marchan...
He conceals and reveals at the same time, plays to adopt different personalities, as he did throughout his career, including with his characters Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.
Nothing surprising therefore that he has a mask by hand in the photograph of the campaign The Travel Invitation, of the Louis Vuitton brand, whose new face embodies.
It will appear in one of their advertising spots, broadcast from November 10th.
Defence Minister Rob Nicholson insisted that wounded soldiers were not summarily released from the Canadian Armed Forces, and stressed that a transition process was followed by all soldiers prior to their return to civilian life.
Attacked by Liberals and Neo-Democrats in the House of Commons, Mr. Nicholson assured that prior to their release, members of the army followed a transition plan in collaboration with their superiors.
All wounded soldiers receive appropriate care for their return to civilian life and none of them is released before being ready, he said.
Detractors accuse the government of wanting to save money by not allowing wounded soldiers - who do not respond to the army's "university of service" rule requiring staff to be able to perform a variety of tasks - to reach the 10-year eligibility period required for retirement benefits.
They cited two cases reported by La Presse Canadienne, including that of a soldier released last Friday.
Corporal David Hawkins, a reservist from London, Ontario, had post-traumatic stress syndrome, was released from the army despite his request to remain for an additional year in order to receive a fully indexed retirement.
His case followed that of Corporal Glen Kirkland, who told a parliamentary committee last month that he had been pushed out before being ready because he did not respond to the rule of universality of service.
Mr. Hawkins pointed out that a soldier could be prepared from the start, with plans and consultation sessions, but that this was totally different than wanting to leave the ranks.
"I told them I wasn't ready," he said during an interview with the Canadian Press on Wednesday.
I asked for months if there was a way for me to stay, and they said no.
Since the beginning of the major fighting in Afghanistan, the army has been unable to determine what latitude it can give to wounded soldiers who want to remain in the ranks but who are not able to fight.
Under the current rules, severely injured soldiers have up to three years to recover.
If they do not meet the criteria for deployment abroad, they may be forced to leave the army.
Data presented to Parliament last year indicate that among the 1218 soldiers released for medical reasons, 199 had not reached the required length of service to obtain retirement benefits.
The Liberal spokesperson for former fighters, Jim Karygiannis, called for the reintegration of Corporal Hawkins on Wednesday, while New Democratic Jack Harris called for the immediate end of "this shameful practice".
Disney put on the tablets to launch an animated series
The American media and entertainment group Disney decided to prefer tablets to its own television channels for the upcoming release of a new series for children.
The first nine episodes of Sheriff Callie's Wild West will be available from November 24 at the watchdisneyjunior.com site or via its application for phones and tablets.
Its global launch on the Disney group's channels is only scheduled for 2014, details the release of its Disney Junior division.
The cartoon, designed for children aged 2 to 7, tells about the adventures of the Cat Callie, sheriff of a city in the West of America where she makes order rule with a magic lasso.
Each episode includes two 11-minute stories.
"Interacting with smartphones and tablets is a second nature for children today," commented Albert Cheng, Vice President in charge of digital products at Disney/ABC Television Group, quoted in the press release.
This type of experience is part of Disney's efforts to "extend the lifetime of its series and build new relationships with its public through digital platforms that are increasingly important," he added.
A survey published earlier this week by Common Sense Media revealed an explosion in the use of mobile devices by young children in the United States: 38% of children under 2 years of age have already used a tablet or telephone, and 72% of those under 8 years of age, compared to 10% and 38% two years ago, respectively.
Snowden is ready to "co-operate" with Germany on the issue of American surveillance
Edward Snowden, the U.S. intelligence service whistleblower, said he was willing to go to Berlin to testify before the German Parliament if the United States National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander did not provide any answers to their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian StrÃ¶bele met with Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was entitled to asylum, to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter to the media in Berlin on Friday, Mr. Snowden said: "Although the result of my efforts has been clearly positive, my government continues to treat the difference of opinion as a leak and seeks to penalize the political discourse with accusations against which it is impossible to defend itself."
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden wrote that he believed that the support of the international community could persuade the U.S. government to abandon the criminal charges held against him.
As part of the complaint filed by the U.S. Department of Justice, he is accused of espionage and theft of State property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, Minister of the German Interior, told Zeit Online: "If Mr. Snowden is ready to speak to the German officials, we will make this possible."
Relations between the United States and Germany were severely challenged as a result of allegations that the NSA had listened to the German Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone.
Thomas Oppermann, the deputy leader of the parliamentary group overseeing foreign secret services, said that if there was a chance to hear Mr. Snowden as a witness "without endangering and completely ruining relations with the United States," it was necessary to take advantage of it.
Mr StrÃ¶bele, German Green Member, published a photo of him with Mr Snowden on his Twitter account.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. StrÃ¶bele said that, according to the lawyer of the former NSA consultant, Mr. Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Mr Snowden testified in Germany, he should be assured that he would be "safe" there, said the Member.
Mr. Snowden wrote in his letter that he had been subjected to a "serious and sustained" persecution campaign that had forced him to leave his country.
However, he said he had been encouraged by the global response to "my act of political expression".
Citizens from around the world as well as senior officials â including the United States â considered that the revelation of an inexplicable system of permanent surveillance was of public utility.
The letter advances an offer of cooperation with the German authorities "when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved".
Cogeco Cable could soon offer interactive TV
Cogeco Cable subscribers may well have access to applications such as Facebook, Twitter and ultimately the video service on request Netflix via their television in the future that does not seem so far away.
Cogeco's subsidiary reported on Thursday that it was currently conducting preliminary beta tests on this platform with some of its users.
"This will allow us to develop more user-friendly interfaces as well as more options," said Cogeco's President and CEO Louis Audet, in an interview.
Cogeco Cable thus takes the step to its competitors, like Bell, even though Cogeco's subsidiary has not yet a specific date with regard to this new platform.
"We need to adapt and change or resist change and fail," said Audet.
The ultimate goal remains to provide tools to which our clients currently do not have access.
The Rogers telecommunications giant has already indicated that he could offer Netflix if certain technical details, which were not cited, could be resolved.
In the United States, the popular video service says it is in discussions with some major cable providers to make its service available through their broadcasting platforms.
P.-d. of Cogeco and Cogeco Cable also welcomed the announcement made by the Harper government in its Speech from the Throne on October 16.
Ottawa wishes to force cable and satellite television providers to provide customers with the opportunity to pay on-board services.
"It's been about two and a half years since we say that the idea of forcing consumers to buy important chain packages is not working," said Mr. Audet.
He hoped, however, that the consultations conducted by the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) would lead to interesting recommendations.
"It will have to emerge from these discussions a new kind of reference framework to define our new Canadian cultural policy with regard to television," said Cogeco, p.-d.g.
The CRTC has been conducting consultations with the public since last week and they are expected to continue with industry next spring.
On the side of the results, Cogeco reported having recorded a net profit of 43.8 million in the fourth quarter, or 82 Â¢ per share.
This is a decrease compared to the net profit of 44.9 million, or 83 Â¢ per share, of the same period last year.
The company established in Montreal explains this decrease due to depreciation costs related to new acquisitions.
Cogeco acquired the Atlantic Broadband cable distributor, established in the United States in 2012 for 1.36 billion.
This was the first major acquisition of the company after the one that had failed in Portugal.
Last December, the Montreal company also purchased Peer 1 Network Enterprises, an Internet supplier established in Vancouver, for the sum of $526 million.
As for Cogeco's revenues, they experienced a growth of 41.5 per cent in the fourth quarter to reach 504.7 million.
They are 1.8 billion for the current financial year.
The net profit of its main subsidiary, Cogeco Cable, was 43.9 million, or 90 Â¢ per share, down from 45.7 million, or 93 Â¢ per share, from the same period last year.
However, Cogeco Cable's revenues increased by 45% to $470.4 million.
The company lost 15,237 customers in the fourth quarter.
However, for the financial year 2013, the number of Cogeco Cable customers is increasing 5546.
Mr. Audet does not worry about seeing the number of customers fluctuating like that.
For me, it is not an indication of a change of trend, he observed.
It varies from quarter to quarter with a very strong competition.
Horses in beef products
Horse meat has been detected in beef canned products, sold by two small British low-priced dispensers, today announced the food hygiene agency.
Regular tests revealed that the products, developed in January in Romania and sold by the Home Bargains and Quality Save chains, contained 1 to 5% horse DNA.
"As the horse meat is not mentioned in the list of ingredients, it should not have been present in the product," the British agency explained.
A scandal about the presence of horsemeat in cooked dishes broke out in Europe at the beginning of the year, following tests carried out in Ireland.
According to European Commission reviews, France was the most affected by the presence of such meat in products intended to contain only beef.
A collision between two vehicles resulted in four injuries, early Friday, on road 131, in LanaudiÃ¨re.
Shortly before 4h, a car driver traveling north, in Saint-FÃ©lix-de-Valois, lost control of his vehicle and hit a car that arrived in the other direction.
The four occupants of the two vehicles were injured, but they were not afraid for their lives.
The traffic was back to normal around 6:00 on Friday.
Border Airlines plans to make luggage pay by hand
Border Airlines plans to pay up to $100 to passengers carrying hand baggage on their flights.
Border Airlines plans to start paying up to $100 for a hand luggage and $2 for a coffee or a soda, although in its announcement Wednesday, it indicated that passengers could take the cane unopened with them at the plane's descent.
The new luggage costs relate to bags stored in the upper compartment, so the small bags installed under the seat will always be free.
Border stated that it would pay $25 if charges were paid in advance and $100 if travellers paid only once at the boarding gate.
Border spokesperson Kate O'Malley indicated that $100 was planned to encourage travellers to pay their expenses in advance.
"We don't want to make this price pay," she explained.
The airlines began to pay for the first and second baggage registered in 2008.
Passengers who tried to avoid these charges put as many things as they could in the hand luggage stored in the upper compartments, so there was often no more room in those compartments.
These costs are a way to ensure that passengers carry fewer things on board.
O'Malley said these new expenses won't really be used to collecting money.
It is a matter of making Border customers more loyal that it becomes increasingly difficult to find a place in the upper compartments.
Passengers who buy their ticket on the airline's website will not have to pay.
Thus, a passenger tailing at a border port could carry a bag free of charge, while the next person in the tail might have to pay $100 for a similar bag.
O'Malley explained that the Border site and registration procedures are changing to ensure that passengers know the existence of these costs before arriving at the door.
Border hand baggage costs will not be applied before summer, although no dates have been set.
Passengers often fly about baggage and other expenses, but airlines love them.
They believe that baggage handling costs are important and that passengers who want this service should pay for it.
Many people at Wall Street consider the addition of baggage charges as a sign that proves that airlines pay enough to cover the cost of the air trip after years of loss.
Yet many of them have not affected baggage costs.
Spirit Airlines Inc. had applied the first hand luggage charges three years ago, and the low-cost Allegient company followed a little later.
The only other company imposing such charges is the Hungarian company Wizz Air, declared the consultant to Jay Sorensen airlines, which closely follows the additional costs.
In a December 2011 report, he estimated that Spirit's hand luggage costs were $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines executive, recently travelled on Spirit and wondered what he was going to find at the boarding gate when passengers would discover the unusual hand luggage charges imposed by the company.
"I've never seen such a fluid boarding procedure in my entire career," he said.
I was waiting to see toothbrushes and a fight popping up at the door.
The plane was full, he added, "the passengers are on board at the speed of the lightning".
Border also makes Spirit and applies $2 for coffee, tea, soda or fruit juice.
Border indicated that passengers who take a soda or fruit juice can take the cane unopened with them, and those who take coffee can be served free of charge.
She will always distribute water for free.
US Airways briefly attempted to pay for drinks in 2008 but returned seven months later after passengers complained and no other major airline had followed.
Frontier's decision to pay for hand luggage when passengers don't buy their ticket directly from the airline is his last effort to encourage customers to go to his site.
Airlines pay online travel sellers like Orbitz $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This prompted all airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly from them instead of addressing an online travel agency.
However, the Frontier went further in this area.
In September, it began to offer only half a thousand loyalty to customers who bought their ticket via an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, it reduced premiums by 25 per cent on a trip.
For example, a 1 000-mile border trip purchased from an online travel agency would make it possible to earn 250 miles.
It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they purchase their ticket directly on the Border site.
Border has a loyal clientele in its home town, Denver, but its activity is falling apart and it loses money.
Revenue fell by 9% and its flight capacity decreased by almost 13% in the first quarter, according to the financial results published by its parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic attempted to straighten out Border's finances by selling the airline.
The NSA is calling into question an "internal error" and not computer hackers for the failure of its site
The National Security Agency working in the shadows said Friday it was a bug that had caused the loss of its public site for a few hours, and not hackers like some had claimed it online.
"NSA.gov remained inaccessible for a few hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during a planned update," said the spy agency in an email statement.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The allegations that the failure was due to a distributed denial of service [DSD] are false.
Earlier this evening, online server trackers noted that the NSA site had been down for at least 6 hours, and some users still cannot access the site.
Earlier, a NSA spokesperson informed ABC News that the Agency's sensitive internal network was "not at all" compromised.
No classified information is in danger, explained the spokesman.
At least one group of online hackers claimed to be responsible for the failure of the NSA site by a DSD attack.
DSD attacks aim to flood a targeted site until servers are overloaded and the site collapses.
Cyber-tactical is not very sophisticated and attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal network of the system concerned.
The NSA was once extremely secret, once known as the "No Such Agency", was under the spotlight of the projectors and strongly criticised in recent months following a wave of revelations about its extensive communications monitoring programs at the national and foreign levels â which are part of the secret files of the NSA stolen from the agency and disclosed by the former unsatisfied consultant of the NSA, Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy around the agency has caused many speculations that tonight's incident was the result of a targeted cyber-operation.
Delta Centre-Ville now closed
The Delta Centre-Ville hotel closed its doors in Montreal Thursday, after 36 years of existence.
The investment fund that owned the building sold it to promoters who will transform it into student residences.
Three hundred and fifty people worked at the hotel.
Of these, 200 have not yet found new jobs.
Delta promises not to let his employees drop.
Employers came to meet employees directly on site, employees were met individually to assess their needs.
"This support will continue for the next six months," explains Regional Director of Working Relations at Delta Hotels, Felix Bisson.
The closing of the Delta intervenes in a very competitive hotel market.
The investment fund that owned this building had a choice to make.
Either he reinvested in the building to continue to operate it, so there were investments of tens of millions while the competition is very fierce, there are many new hotels that appeared in Montreal.
"Or he sold it to someone else and that's what happened," says Paul Arsenault, holder of the Transat Tourism Chair at the UQAM School of Science Management.
Other Montreal hotels will also be converted in the coming months, such as the Crown Plaza, which will become a residence for older people.
In the meantime, four hotel projects totaling almost 600 rooms will see the day in two years.
For Titan's CEO, "Goodyear Amiens' purchase project starts with zero employee"
After throwing the sponge with failure in January for the partial recovery of the Goodyear website of Amiens-Nord promised to close, Maurice Taylor, the CEO of the American tyre Titan, declares today ready to save 333 jobs out of the 1 137 that counts the factory.
Arnaud Montebourg, Minister of Productive Recovery, had already announced it on Monday, October 21.
After giving up the factory purchase project in January, you are back today.
You had spoken of violent attacks and insults, speaking of "so-called workers", who "work three hours" a day, of "fire" unions, targeting the CGT.
We don't understand this turn-face.
Is this to please Mr. Montebourg?
I'm not trying to please anyone.
Except my wife.
Mr. Montebourg is a charming young man who tries to save industrial jobs among the best paid.
If I hurt someone by my words, I'm sorry.
But France also has a high level of tax and unemployment.
Does the truth hurt you?
Working seven hours a day when in other countries eight hours are disabled in France.
In India, China and other countries, we work ten to twelve hours a day.
But I don't have any prejudices about France.
What I see is a factory that manufactures good agricultural tires, has good equipment, is well located and has spaces to expand.
Why does Titan need this factory so much?
Titan doesn't need to buy this factory.
But with a fair price and skilled workers, it is worth a try.
What kind of agreement do you expect between CGT and Goodyear?
If, since the announcement of the closure of the factory, Goodyear had offered employees a good start-up allowance, I think 100% of the employees would have accepted it.
Now, let's imagine that Titan buys the closed factory at Goodyear.
As a result, Titan could move the machines to Poland or any other country in the European Union that still has its own currency.
I think Mr. Montebourg knows that.
But he wants to keep Amiens' factory with at least 333 well-paid jobs.
Titan agrees to recruit them among some 1,200 current Goodyear employees.
So Mr. Montebourg needs a commitment from Titan before trying to get the CGT to sit at the table with Goodyear.
The first step is that the CGT and Goodyear seal an agreement on departure allowances for all employees.
Hence, there will be no employees in the factory.
Mr. Montebourg said you were ready to guarantee these 333 jobs for four years.
Do you confirm it?
The only number I mentioned to the Minister is 333.
I know he'd want a four-year warranty.
But, as I told you, the CGT and Goodyear must first agree on starting allowances.
If all employees accept them, the factory purchase project starts with zero employees.
How can we provide guarantees of employment duration when there are no more employees on the site?
If Mr. Montebourg achieves that the CGT and Goodyear agree and that Titan buys the factory, we intend to stay in Amiens-Nord for more than four years.
Bombardier's profit is falling, while aircraft deliveries and orders fall back
Bombardier Inc, Canadian aviation and rail manufacturer, reported a 15% drop in its net profit on Thursday, under pressure from a decrease in aircraft orders and deliveries during the third quarter and contractual problems in its Trains division.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not provide flight test data for his new CSeries aircraft nor information to determine whether the aircraft will meet its ambitious commercial deployment schedule by September next.
After the inaugural flight of the test plane about a month and a half ago, the aircraft stole only three times, and the question was whether the test phase was on track.
The results were not consistent with the forecasts and the share rate declined by 8% to the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, analyst at the National Bank Financial, lowered its rating on Thursday from "surface performance" to "sector performance" due to the low potential for the increase in the grant in the next quarter or the next two quarters.
"Although the decline in aircraft deliveries has been largely anticipated, we are really disappointed by the profit margin in the Transport Division," said Cameron Doerksen in a customer rating.
We believe Bombardier will register new orders for its CSeries aircraft as the flight test program moves forward.
However, if no new order is announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more sceptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft family will be able to catapult it into the lower segment of a market today dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test plane was unveiled in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delay.
But the number of firm orders for CSeries aircraft is so far modest to 177. It seems that potential buyers are waiting for the results of the in-flight testing to validate the company's claims regarding the energy efficiency and potential savings of the new line aircraft.
Currently, the company has registered a total of 403 purchase orders and commitments from 15 customers and operators.
Pierre Beaudoin, President and Chief Executive Officer, is convinced that Bombardier will achieve its objective of 300 firm orders prior to the commercial deployment of the first aircraft.
Leaders also reassured analysts and media on Thursday by indicating that the programme was progressing in accordance with the timetable.
"The test plane did not remain on the ground longer than planned," said Mr. Beaudoin at a telephone conference, adding that ground tests and software updates were planned during the aircraft's stop time.
Each manufacturer plans differently.
We had decided to proceed with a first flight and provide for an update period, and that is what we have done.
This will be repeated throughout the flight program.
The second of the five test planes is expected to fly in the coming weeks, the others will follow shortly thereafter, said the company.
However, analysts are skeptical that the first customer can fly a CSeries plane only 12 months after his inaugural flight.
Bombardier indicated that she was evaluating the schedule of entry into service and will provide new information in the coming months.
"This slow flight test â although apparently in line with Bombardier's internal schedule â strengthens our view that entry into service will be postponed in the first quarter of 2015," said Doerksen.
In the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier's net profit dropped to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, compared to $172 million, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier.
The result by adjusted action remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Income decreased slightly from $4.2 to $4.1 million.
Analysts expected a result of 10 cents per share and revenues of $4.56 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth aircraft manufacturer reported that he had delivered 45 aircraft during the quarter, compared to 57 a year earlier.
The net controls fell to 26 aircraft, compared to 83 earlier.
The delay in the Aeronautical Division represented $32.9 million as at September 30, an unchanged figure compared to December 31st of the previous year.
"In Aeronautics, the results were consistent with our forecasts, but the low number of orders and general market conditions were disappointing," said Beaudoin.
Aeronautical revenues fell by 13 per cent to $2 million.
Bombardier, the world's largest railway manufacturer, said that the revenues of this division had increased from nearly 11 per cent to $2.1 million.
The Transport Division's order book totalled $32.6 million as at September 30, a slight increase compared to December 31st of the previous year.
The margins of the Transport Division have suffered from enforcement problems concerning some major contracts.
Leaders announced that new indications would be provided in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier's share course, which also announced that Patrick Pichette, Chief Financial Officer of Google Inc, would sit on the Board of Directors, fell from 8.5% to $4.83 in the afternoon of Thursday.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the world's third largest aviation manufacturer and closest competitor to Bombardier, reported a 10% drop in its quarterly profit on Thursday.
Two 23 and 27-year-old speculators were missing in a gouffre under the Crolles tooth since Thursday evening, we learned Friday at the IsÃ¨re Relief Speleo.
They were located this Friday afternoon.
The two men, one war in practice and the other not, were left under the ground around 9:30 p.m. to cross the Dent de Crolles, located in the municipality of Saint-Pierre-de-Chartreuse.
We had no news of them since then, specified the same source.
"Speleologists should have emerged around 5:00 a.m.," said Thierry Larribe, technical adviser to the Speleo aid agency in charge of the relief organization.
Tens of people on site
Some 20 rescuers, ten civilians from the French Spleo, as well as gendarmes, CRS and firemen were on site.
At the end of the afternoon this Friday, the two epileologists were located.
"It is another group of epileologists who, after finding them exhausted but healthy in the cavity, forwarded the information to one of the relief teams engaged in the network," Le DauphinÃ© explains.
The two soldiers at the 13th Battalion of the ChambÃ©ry Alpine Hunters were found "exhausted but not injured".
They lost in the network, returned to their steps pending relief, specified the prefecture.
Refueled, they should emerge from the cavity with the help of the rescuers in the evening.
German journalists invited to flee Google and Yahoo
The German Journalists Union invited its members Thursday to stop using Google and Yahoo's online services following new revelations on the activities of the United States and British intelligence services.
"The German Federation of Journalists recommends that journalists refrain from using Google and Yahoo's search engines and messaging until further notice," she said.
It considers the information of the Washington Post " scandalous", according to which the US National Security Agency (NSA) and the British Government Communications Heads (GCHQ) have collected mass information by infiltrating international networks that allow both companies to sync their servers.
"The research carried out by journalists is as confidential as the coordinates of their sources and the nature of their communications with them," added Michael Konken, president of the union claiming 38,000 members.
Repetitious acts: a Member of Parliament is applying for the resignation of Brigitte Gruwels
Minister Brigitte Gruwels' project of "relifting" signalposts in Brussels does not please everyone.
As a reminder, the Brussels Minister for Public Works and Transport launched a test project in central Brussels on Thursday, consisting of 16 signalposts from the region in the yellow and blue colours of Brussels.
The goal being both "increasing security" and "Brussels identity".
The idea is, in the long term, to recapture all the Brussels signalling lights, at an estimated cost of about EUR 1 million.
But the blue chosen by the minister is "too dark", according to Brussels MP Emmanuel De Bock, who speaks of "flammation" of the capital and demands the "resignation" of Brigitte Gruwels.
"Not content to spend the money of the Brusselsmen in the relifting operations of the colour-signalling posts of the Brussels Region, Brigitte Gruuels continues his Flemish operations of the Capital," Mr. De Bock emerges in a statement.
After her yellow-mango-black taxis, she finally repainted herself in black-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow the Brussels poles.
According to the honourable Member, there is now no "more difference in visual continuity between Flanders and Brussels".
The Brusselsers deserve better than seeing their money wasted by a CD&V minister who runs the NVA program itself.
It's high time to stop Troy's horse from Flanders.
"To remember, Brigitte Gruwels was elected only with 2,245 votes or 0.5% of the Brusselsmen!" concludes Mr. De Bock.
the portico of Pont-de-Buis dismounted
The ecotax portico of Pont-de-Buis, around which a violent demonstration of opponents of this tax took place on Saturday morning, was dismantled Thursday morning.
Some cranes arrived on site shortly after 10 a.m., and the traffic on the national had been diverted to the cliff.
The decision to dismantle, announced by the Prefecture of the FinistÃ¨re on Wednesday, was taken by the company Ecomov, manager of the portico.
These are the last of the three ecotax ports operating in the FinistÃ¨re department, the other two having been dismantled or sabotaged.
Launch of an accessory store for Google Glass
An online shop, offering multiple accessories dedicated to Google Glass, has just been made available to thousands of developers with a prototype of Google-signed connected glasses.
They can thus acquire a listener, a charger or even a storage case.
This store, strictly reserved for developers already with Google Glass, offers some accessories such as a charger and its USB cable, for $50.
For the same price, it is also possible to acquire a protective cover made of micro-fibre or an intra-earphone listener.
Although Google is currently working on a Google Glass model equipped with correction glasses, no large-scale marketing dates have yet been confirmed.
It's been five years since my father got out of the world of the living.
At first I denied his death, I was talking about him at present,
I was so afraid to forget it or rather I didn't know how I was going to continue to "freshen him."
There is no recipe, no method of use to pass the wall of the invisible and find its own.
Then there were signs.
The first time it was the very strong feeling of his presence on the passenger seat while I was driving.
Another time, a gentle awakens in the middle of the night to watch his watch that never leaves me, placed on the night table.
It's my smiling father's image that accompanies me in my daily gestures.
Our mother left us after her exhausting fight against cancer.
At least that's what I thought the day I found his body empty, shrieked on this hospital bed with the loose sheets.
Likewise, his funeral was a glacial farewell focused around the thin light of the candles that would frame his coffin.
I thought she was gone.
Little by little, by small daytime or night appearances, somewhat shy, a little erased, she quickly came back into my mind, evolving as she resumed her place in the landscape of my thought that was in mourning.
And then she revealed herself to me while revealing my own facets that I had not yet perceived, masked by my relationship with her.
So I learned and understood that I had never lost my mother's person but just a woman I didn't really know, a woman who incarnated that person during her stay in life.
By dying, this woman had perfected her life and freed the person I loved, and here I found her, full and whole.
This deviation from the path of my life remains the most unexpected and most beautiful.
It is a privilege to know that loved ones never leave us.
I look like my dad, "in and out" it looks like him.
I've always been told.
I never believed it at the time.
I had difficult relationships with him until he got old, sick.
There, I wasn't afraid of him anymore, and I could love him.
One day, he died.
For a long time, he accompanied me: when I stopped smoking, when I was scared, when I got hurt...
He talked to me, encouraged me constantly, lived my body.
I saw his hands looking at mine, lending him my body.
But it was never indiscreet.
I could have had a personal life.
He left me my privacy.
It lasted a long time and then one day he left.
Finally, it was comfortable and reassuring to be understood, encouraged, advised.
I no longer know who said that the deceased are not forgotten but invisible.
My parents are no longer, but I feel them constantly close to me.
Every event, every moment of my life makes me feel their presence because I still mean it: what would they have said ? what would they have thought ? what would they have done ?
I constantly dream of them, maybe not every night, but several times a week it's certain.
I often dream of the last moments that I have to share with them before it is too late, only, there is always one thing that prevents me from fulfilling this moment.
I often wake up anxious when it happens and feel deeply absent.
Sometimes some dreams carry me on the contrary and are part of my history and indeed they continue to live and share my life.
On the day before my ultrasound where I had to know about my baby's sex, I dreamed of waking up, getting up out of bed, my father was waiting for me on the floor and he smiled at me and rejoiced that I was waiting for a little boy.
The next day, I had the feeling that he had visited me in my sleep to mean that he was happy to share what happened to me.
And of course, he was a little boy in my belly.
I liked to share this moment with him and I am delighted to share this shared memory lived after his death.
Five years ago, my grandmother died of cancer.
A year ago, she was traveling with my family to Cuba.
That is the shock that his disappearance caused at the young bachelor's that I was at the time.
I still did my mourning pretty quickly.
But it continues to influence my life, especially when I am in trouble, or when I have to make important decisions.
Learning Arabic and interested me in the Middle East, to the point of mastering it in a large school, was not, with the decline, anodine choices.
In fact, I often heard him speak Arabic in my childhood, and talk about Morocco, where she had lived for decades - before returning to France at the time of independence.
The values she has instilled in me are always present, so I can think of how she would like me to act at some point.
The same applies to my attitude: I try to be up to the generosity and rightness of the one who was a fervent believer.
Now I feel it as a daily presence, a benevolent soul, a saving spirit.
I see her eyes laying on me.
My mother died nineteen years ago.
He died after talking to me on the phone.
I have been through all phases: misunderstanding, anger, pain, crying that starts alone, anywhere, whenever, in unusual places, unconcerned moments.
Then time calmed down the pain.
Only the lack, this void without response, this need for her, to entrust me, to reassure me at the hollow of her gentleness.
Yet, she is there, silent presence, she is there and looks at me.
Every morning, I see his restless eyes laying on me, I see the circles that magnify his eyes, the wrinkles around the lips that the cigarettes dig, the folds that mark the front of the days of anxiety.
My mother took possession of my face and she looks at me every morning in my mirror.
And every morning, I turn my eyes away.
My wife and mother of my three children died of cancer at 43 years of age.
We always feel his protection, nothing serious can happen to us.
It was his promise on his bed of pain, so we gradually learned to smile again, and pronouncing his name is no longer taboo but a comfort.
Of course, I speak to her in the hole of the night when the absence hurts too much, she invites herself into my dreams when the moral is a little reached.
We feel worn and protected in difficult times, the decline of time makes us realize how much she was the conductor and we are trying to stay in the path that she had tracked us.
If a being loved you very much, absence cannot take it from your heart and memories.
In a way, being loved becomes your inner energy.
I lost my father on August 22, 2008 following a asbestos cancer.
I was very close to him, I always acted according to what he thought or what he liked.
I couldn't attend his inhumation and three weeks after his death, I was giving birth to a little boy.
If I have my convictions sometimes different from hers, I still wonder if my actions are consistent with her vision of things.
I have had problems in my work for these convictions.
For me, it's impossible to go in the opposite direction, I don't sleep and I still wonder what he'll think of it.
I don't know if I've adopted his way of being or if I'm just like him: is that genetic?
In any case, it will always be my reference.
It was a little like a alter ego, there was no need to talk to each other.
In short, he's here every day.
I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
My husband died at the age of 33.
I was 28 years old and our six-year-old son.
The immense pain that then invaded me has, of course, diminished, but it is still close to me.
Very often he "disembarks" in my dreams in such a precise way, so alive that at awakening I am even sadder to see that it was just a dream.
The other night, he asked me if I was going well, I said no, he answered me "I'm going down" but with such a real voice that I woke up in shock, worried and lit the hair lamp by looking everywhere, convinced that he was coming.
I always live in the same house, and often I feel observed and I go back to see if he's not there, I know it's him and I'm talking to him.
In all the pieces I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
For nothing in the world I would not leave this house where we were happy and his spirit lives with me.
I am 58 years old, I have always lived alone since he left, he is and will remain the love of my life.
I want to say that I am sociable with a responsible profession, I laugh and sing, I go out, I'm grandmother, I have lots of friends, but my heart and soul belong to him and I never talk about him except with my son, and I never go to the cemetery.
Iraq: October was the bloodiest month since 2008
October was in Iraq the most murderous month since April 2008.
Baghdad published this Friday official figures: 964 people lost their lives last month: 855 civilians, 65 police and 44 soldiers.
This publication takes place on the day the Iraqi Prime Minister is received by the American President.
Noury al-Maliki wants help from the United States.
"We do not tell the world to be with us and to support us, we have the right to ask the world because we are part of it," Al-Maliki said on Thursday in Washington.
And also because if what's going on in Iraq isn't settled, it's going to expand, and what's going on in Syria is going to expand as well.
And what happens when a terrorist virus lives? it spreads.
Noury al-Maliki spoke at the U.S. Institute for Peace, an independent institution created by Congress.
Outside the building, protesters protested against the Iraqi leader.
They branded banners accusing him, among other things, of being a murderer and calling on the United States to refuse to provide him with help.
The cocaine lawyer who informed a drug sponsor of a police investigation was imprisoned.
Basharat Dita, 42 years old, was giving information to the crime lord Neil Scarbrough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction would not be revealed in the great day.
He was sentenced to three years' imprisonment by the Liverpool Court of Assizes
A senior defence lawyer, who had informed a drug sponsor of a major police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug addiction would not be revealed, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42 years old, provided sensitive information to the criminal lord Neil Scarbrough about investigations into his drug trafficking activities after being compromised because of his habit of consuming cocaine.
The lawyer, who was referred to as "Bash" and considered by criminals as a "primary case of importance", was arrested at his home in 2011 as a result of police listening operations directed towards Scarborough, which he had represented in a previous trial in relation to drug trafficking.
Police officers identified Sarborough, 32, by placing three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was attending a bar dinner with confreres.
Investigations revealed that Dita was a "regular consumer" of this class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in her hair, on her wallet and credit cards.
Over an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he sought illegal information on the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his associates.
The four suspects were then monitored by the police as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire counties.
With 32 other men, they were subsequently imprisoned after the police seized heroin and cocaine for an amount of Â£1.5 million, as well as more than Â£200,000 in cash during a series of raids.
Dictta, 42 years old, provided information to criminals because he feared that his addiction would not be revealed in the great day.
Today, at Liverpool's seat court, Ditta, who works in the Forbes Solicitors' law firm located in Blackburn, fell in disgrace after being convicted on two counts of impeachment after a three-week trial.
He admitted possession of cocaine during a previous hearing.
The lawyer's fall occurred after the police, investigating Scarborough, discovered that he had been in regular telephone contact with Dita in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and found him arriving at the home of Ditta and placing drugs, pure to 60%, under the lawyer's garbage in a black golf glove.
Shortly after the deposit, Scarborough was regularly in telephone contact with Ditta who was at a dinner at the Ewood Park football stadium, pregnant with the Blackburn Rovers club.
The lawyer returned home, discovered the drug and called nine times.
The court heard that Dita was a "regular consumer" of cocaine after tests showed traces of this Class A drug in her hair, on her wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was arrested later but refused to consume cocaine. He said he had spoken to the alleged drug dealer because he was his client and argued that their discussions were subject to a "legal privilege".
During his arrest, Ditta collected his wallet and tried to remove several credit cards, but they were all seized and a hair sample was taken from him.
During an interrogation, he stated that he owned an office at his home, as well as at his workplace, and that clients would call him home for legal matters.
But the court heard testimony that it called for major actors in the drug trade, some of which it had represented, after key arrests to tell them which investigators were aware of.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: "If anyone should know that the law should not be violated, he is a criminal lawyer."
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer, and of being too involved with private clients.
The relationship we are talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who supplies drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his communications will undoubtedly be legitimate communications because he was his lawyer.
But this went well beyond the ordinary limits of a relationship between a lawyer and his client.
He impeded the police investigation as much as he could in order to enable him to pursue his criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not honor his profession, but dishonored him.
He has been too close to some customers, particularly Scarborough, and has allowed him to compromise his independence.
Ditta denied any illegal action and said: "If I was a corrupt lawyer, what I am not, and if I wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited 15 hours, I would have done so immediately."
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police said: "Mr. Ditta passed from criminal lawyer to criminal himself when he started getting drugs from criminal organizations."
His addiction to cocaine has forever compromised him and made him vulnerable to the background of the leaders of organized criminal groups who have charged him with obtaining valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers should observe the strictest integrity rules and establish a climate of public confidence.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to shelter himself behind the varnish of his profession.
The Lancashire Serious and Organized Crime Unit conducted an investigation into Mr. Dita, who was convicted of the three counts of cocaine possession and now impeded justice, bearing in mind his commitment to prosecuting criminals in court.
That this case serves as a warning for criminals to know that no one is above the law.
We will find you and bring you before the courts.
Scarborough himself was imprisoned for 14 years after pleading guilty of complicity in trafficking in heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other persons involved in trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drug trafficking.
On his site, Ditta organized a question/answer session on himself during which he said that his dream job would be to be a lawyer to represent clients in the death row in America, his last invitation to dinner would be Mohammed Ali and inequality would motivate him to work.

Menton reduces the cost of its Christmas lighting
420 motifs, 2.2 kilometres of seashore covered with a light coat: the hot blow to Menton could be fluttered with the bill of illumination.
Invoice which, unlike many municipalities, is more regulated by taxpayers, not by trade associations.
To alleviate its costs, the city uses LEDs.
But also a differentiated management of the public lighting network and Christmas decorations.
Los Angeles Airport evacuated after a shooting
A shooting took place at Los Angeles International Airport.
It was 10:00 a.m. local time when a man opened the fire.
According to the local police, there would be at least 2 injured.
This would be an employee working for the U.S. Transportation Safety Authority (TSA) and the shooter.
The incident would have occurred at Terminal 3, causing a wave of panic.
Travellers and staff moved to the exits or on the tarmac.
Soon the police forces intervened and a man suspected of being the shooter was caught on the roof of an airport parking lot.
The airport is being evacuated and air traffic is interrupted.
Classical song for teenagers
Each time, it is the school clientele that will be targeted, an initiative that had been very successful during the previous season.
Through five saynetes imagined and interpreted by artists from the region, cartoons with a high dose of humor, adolescents are allowed to learn the classical song.
In addition to this show, the Society of Lyric Art of the Kingdom will return with its lyrical destinations, a formula that now fills the room at the Pulpie de Chicoutimi.
Two other concerts will take place in the summer of 2014, giving artists from the region the chance to show what they are capable of.
To these activities was added the lyrical Aperus, the benefit concert held last August, with the contribution of the soprano colorature Marie-Ãve Munger.
It was a beneficial activity, along with the artistic dimension, and it helped the non-profit organization to produce a financial balance that is as sweet to the ears as an air from the bat.
Without providing precise figures, the chairman of the board, Yves Bergeron, took advantage of the press meeting held yesterday in Chicoutimi, to be reassuring.
Despite the precariousness that is the lot of so many cultural institutions, the future is well drawn, even in the long term.
We have stronger and more constant support.
"Financials are floating and we hope to last until the 50th anniversary of the opera, a step that we will go through in seven years," said the administrator.
"I would say even beyond," added Director General HÃ©lÃ¨ne Gaudreault, smiling.
The 37-year-old man who took a hostage at Gabrielle Roy de Surrey School faces six counts, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
Omar Moustapha Hassan has been accused of taking hostages, kidnapping, making threats, carrying weapons in a dangerous purpose, kidnapping, and failing to comply with an order.
"The rapid reactions of the police involved and their ability to defuse the situation immediately have been essential to the secure conclusion of this incident," Corporal Bert Paquet said through the communiquÃ©.
Omar Hassan is still in custody and will have to appear in court on Friday.
New application for collective remedy against the Saint-Croix brothers
A new application for collective appeal was filed against the Holy Cross brothers, concerning sexual assaults that would have taken place this time in the St. Joseph oratory as well as in several orphanages, colleges and schools.
The request is based on the applicant's testimony, identified as "J. J"., which would have been masturbated in the 1950s, first to Notre-Dame-des-Neiges by his teacher the brother Submits, then by his confessor, Father Bernard, to the St. Joseph oratory, where he was serving as a mass and where his father worked as a painter.
The first appeal was aimed at only three institutions, and when the settlement was announced, many people said to us: "I was in such a place, can I register?" says lawyer Alain Arsenault, who defends the victims in both remedies.
The collective remedy that has just been filed has as a particular feature to allow the addition of complainants from any institution where abuse could have been perpetrated by members of the Congregation of Saint-Croix.
Currently, the appeal brings together complaints from 25 persons who claim to have been assaulted by the Sainte-Croix brothers.
The alleged facts are generally older than those mentioned in the first appeal, since many of the institutions concerned closed their doors in the 1960s.
The appeal also stresses that the Congregation of Saint-Croix and the Oratory of Saint-Joseph, which is a separate entity, "have allowed sexual abuse to be perpetrated against children", that they "have exercised a moral, religious and psychological constraint on the victims", that they "were aware of the sexual abuse perpetrated and nevertheless choked them", and that they have "scientificly and consciously chosen to ignore the problem".
These latter charges are based, among other things, on letters written by the lawyer of the Sainte-Croix brothers, Me Emile Perrin, in the 1990s, but also on the research done in the archives on this subject by Brother Wilson Kennedy, a former brother of Sainte-Croix who publicly denounced the abuse.
The collective appeal must first pass the stage of admissibility in the Supreme Court.
Once the admissibility is accepted by the Court, the second stage is the hearings on the merits.
In the case of the first appeal, the Congregation of Sainte-Croix had agreed to settle amicably before hearings were conducted on the merits.
Important fire in a trade
A fire has seriously damaged a trade in the LaSalle district in Montreal in the night of Thursday through Friday.
The relief was called around 1h, Friday, due to a fire that had declared itself in the basement of an Indian cuisine restaurant on Dollard Avenue, near the intersection with RÃ©jane Street.
The thirty firemen who were sent to the premises took about an hour to master the brewery.
The fire "caused significant damage to the structure of the building," said the Chief to the operations of the Montreal Fire Safety Service, Richard Bordeaux.
The cause of the fire was unknown, but there was no one in the restaurant when the firemen arrived on the scene.
There were no injuries, but almost twenty dwellings, located on the first and second floors of this row of commercial premises, had to be evacuated.
The Red Cross was requested, as residents of one of the apartments may need to be temporarily accommodated, the SIM indicated.
Many opposition to medical help to die at the Congress of Palliative Care
The Canadian Congress of Palliative Care, which is held this week in Ottawa, occurs a few days after the vote in favour of the principle of the bill on medical aid to die in Quebec.
This is an opportunity for several palliative care associations to reaffirm their disagreement.
If all patients had access to effective care to relieve their suffering, in addition to being able to stay at home, very few of them would want to end their days, according to a spokesman for the Canadian Palliative Care Association, Maryse Bouvette.
With emphasis on palliative care in Canada, the approach to euthanasia would be minimal.
The President of the QuÃ©bec Palliative Care Network also rejects the bill on medical assistance to die.
If adopted, Alberte Dery is concerned about the consequences for the next generations.
"What is the meaning of life," she deplores.
The majority of palliative care homes will refuse to help patients die, according to the Vice-President of the Palliative Care Houses Alliance, Suzanne Fitzback.
Ms. Fitzback, also director of Mathieu-Froment-Savoie's house in Gatineau, thought the service would be useless anyway.
We're never asked, "I want to die, give me an injection."
The Director of the Association of Palliative Care of Ontario, Rick Firth, believes that the Quebec bill disorientes the population regarding the vocation of palliative care.
He doesn't think Ontario's gonna take the step.
For her part, the Liberal Member of Gatineau, StÃ©phanie VallÃ©e, says that the notion of end of life must be clarified before the bill is passed.
The Kenyan press is outraged by the controversial media law
"It is a scary country and it is legitimate to ask ourselves the following question: what will prevent Parliament from sweeping the independence of the judicial system tomorrow?" said the newspaper by challenging the bill and calling for it to be declared unconstitutional.
"This law is drastic and very punitive, and we refuse it," explained Cyrus Kamau, CEO of Capital Group â owner of CapitalFM, one of the most respected independent radio stations and Internet sites in Kenya.
He said that the new media court "will always be partial because it is an extension of the government" and that restrictions on content and advertising would adversely affect Kenya's place in the world economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this bill and send it back to the parliamentarians," he added.
According to The Star newspaper, the new bill will allow the government to "hand over the media."The Standard said that democracy and freedom of opinion in Kenya "had been hit hard" and castigated the bill calling it "draconist".
The adoption of the bill at the same time as a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the wake of the attack by armed Islamists at the Westgate mall last September.
The Kenyan media provoked the anger of the authorities by broadcasting images of video surveillance cameras on which troops deployed on the scene of the attack robbed so-called the mall of luxury.
The chief of police, David Kimaiyo, reacted by summoning two journalists and a media officer to interrogate them, although the summons was withdrawn following a lifting of shields in the media.
Under the new bill, the media may be subject to fines ranging from up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and journalists to up to 1 million with the additional risk of being "rescinded" or not being able to receive official press accreditation.
The court also has the power to seize the property of an offender if the offender has not paid his fine.
According to the Daily Nation, "even one fine is enough to paralyze most FM stations."
He also said that measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as Kenya's "enlived blogosphere".
By reducing the media to silence, politicians know that they can do what they want with impunity.
âNo one will ever know,â wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist in The Nation, describing Kenyan media as a key source of control in public life.
âDelivered to themselves, politicians would bankrupt the country and bring us back to hunting and harvesting.â
Kenyan legislators have been the target of the anger of the population in the past.
In May, they took a stand against the cuts ordered by the National Wages Commission and restored their mirror wages of about 522,000 shillings per month tax-free â which are among the highest in the world.
A difficult year for pharmacists
The departure of nearly 10 pharmacists from Laval's Centre for Health and Social Services (CSSS) caused a great deal of excitement in the direction of the City of Health Hospital in 2012-2013.
Due to multiple retirements, maternity leave or short leave, the pharmaceutical department found itself highly staff-deficit.
There was almost 30% of the staff required, making this financial year "very difficult", according to the head of the department, Gillian Beaudet.
However, the CSSS has decided not to engage in self-employment, which can cost up to three times as much as a full-time pharmacist.
There was no use for troubleshooting, explained Mrs Beaudet.
We have streamlined or reduced some of our activities within the facility to level, the time that things are changing.
It is certain that we have worked hard to interest our young [pharmaceutical residents] in order for them to come and stay here.
There is a circumstance contest that made us in a bad situation last year.
Improved situation
After this difficult period, the year 2013-2014 announces much easier for the pharmaceutical department of the CSSS.
Already, three pharmacists are back to work after their maternity leave and three other pharmacists have been hired in recent months.
In addition, the Department's efforts to retain were successful, as the four students currently residing in Laval also decided to remain in the employment of the CSSS.
Now, it's going a lot better, she pointed out the pharmacist.
By the end of the fiscal year, we will have seven new pharmacists and three maternity returns.
This will therefore fill our departures from last year.
Ever-increasing needs
However, the situation remains delicate.
Several factors, such as the shortage of hospital pharmacists or the predominance of young women in the profession, make situations such as that experienced in 2012 difficult to predict.
For us [the number of staff] is always precarious, because we have an environment that is young and we employ a lot of young women, so with pregnancy, we almost always ride three maternity leaves when it's okay, she added.
Last year, we had a lot more and we don't have any pharmacists who are available for replacements, so it was more difficult.
The top 22-year-old model doesn't start his career in cinema by the small door.
Director Lars von Trier chose her to incarnate Charlotte Gainsbourg young in Nymphomaniac, his next film.
This egrene pornographic drama, in eight chapters that will be released in two parts (January 1 and 8, 2014), the erotic memories of a quadrant with sex since adolescence.
Stacy Martin's similarity with his elder is striking: a wink silhouette, a diaphane dye and French-English origins.
Not to mention a certain taste of the risk: the one who had not hesitated to lay naked on ice paper will appear in much more sulfurous situations on large screen.
An extract from Nymphomaniac raised the temperature on the Toile: Stacy Martin appears in bed and in full ecstasy with Shia LaBeouf.
If the provocative filmmaker asked his actors to put their stink in the closet, he used X professionals for the most dared sex scenes, before merging all the bodies digitally: above the belt, it is the star; below, the bow.
From BjÃ¶rk to Charlotte Gainsbourg, passing through Nicole Kidman, Lars von Trier is used to pushing her actresses into their last retaliation, always for the best.
Stacy Martin didn't finish talking about her.
A room of the Narbonne CGR evacuated Thursday night
On Thursday evening, the first session of a film was interrupted at the Mega CGR of Narbonne, as a precautionary measure, following tinglings by the spectators.
Immediately, the director of the facility had the room evacuated and had the firefighters alerted for a suspicious smell.
About 70 people left the meeting.
People were examined and a complete recognition of the room gave nothing.
Bad joke on tear jet background?
Or an involuntary incident?
Is it always that the direction of cinema has played the precautionary principle and the safety of its customers in depth?
The room was aired and everything came in order.
The cinema has been able to regain its rights and customers to find the pleasure of the images.
On screen only.
It tries to import 2 kg of cocaine into citrus fruits
Taking advantage of Halloween day, a woman tried to get two kilos of cocaine hidden in citrus trees at Montreal-Trudeau Airport.
It was during the examination of passenger baggage that the drug could be detected.
Cocaine had been distributed into three tanks that had been previously emptied.
The drug was then transported to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCG) office that took over in this investigation.
The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) did not reveal where the woman came from when she was intercepted.
This is part of the investigation, said Jacqueline Roby, CBSA spokesperson.
What I can tell you is that she was in the country.
Since the beginning of 2013, border services officers at Montreal-Trudeau airport have seized 173 drugs, including 10 cocaine seizures for a total of 44 kilograms.
In 2012, border services officers in the Quebec region carried out a total of 1653 seizures of narcotic drugs.
Air raid against military installations in Syria
According to the Lebanese army, Israeli aircraft entered Lebanese airspace on Wednesday in the early afternoon, but the hits took place in the evening.
A cargo of short-range SA-8 ground-air missiles would have been targeted and destroyed.
This new raid of the Syrian Tsahal aircraft (the sixth since the beginning of the year, according to the Israeli daily Haaretz) has not been confirmed by Israel or Syria.
The raid took place under circumstances almost identical to the one that had taken place on 5 July: at the time, it was also an anonymous American leader who had confirmed to CNN an Israeli attack, this time aimed at Yakhont's sol-sea missiles, delivered by Russia to Damascus.
Israeli officials had not hidden their irritation to see Washington reveal the attack, at the risk of forcing President Assad to react.
Ukraine approaches bankruptcy
The Standard & Poor's rating agency lowered Ukraine's solvency note Friday, questioning the ability of the former Soviet republic, in recession for more than a year, to meet its financial obligations.
The note on the country's public debt securities goes to "B-", which is based on the category of speculative investments.
It has a negative perspective, with S&P seeing at least one out of three chances that it will be reduced again within one year.
"It is less and less likely that the government's strategy will ensure sufficient foreign currencies to meet its high external funding needs," the U.S. agency explains.
The agency notes that Ukraine's foreign reserves fell by 26% between September 2012 and September 2013 and that the trend will continue.
This complicates the reimbursement of credits received abroad.
These reservations, to which the authorities have resorted massively to support the local currency, the hryvnia, collapsing, the agency finds it increasingly likely to be a devaluation, which would increase its external debt.
Kiev also needs liquidity to resolve its gas imports to Russia, which accuses it of not paying an invoice of $882 million.
This announcement is bad news for Ukrainian power in a period of intense tension with its Russian neighbour, angry at Kiev's willingness to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November.
It was made public following the publication of official statistics showing that the country's economy had undergone its fifth quarter of contraction between July and September.
His debt, still relatively modest, has exploded in recent years and S&P estimates it to 33.5% of GDP, compared with less than 10% before the 2008-2009 crisis.
The country, in a budget deficit, has been calling for aid from the International Monetary Fund for months, which in 2010 had been credited with $15.3 billion and has now released only $3.4 billion.
But the Fund refuses to pay any new instalments until the country has adopted unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit, particularly by increasing gas prices to the population.
Following a new unsuccessful mission in the country, the IMF found this week that "the important external financing needs" were "vulnerability", while being "signs of economic improvement".
However, for economist Oleksandr Joloud of the Centre for Political Studies, "a short-term improvement cannot be expected".
"There is little hope that unpopular reforms will be launched in a pre-election year," the Presidential elections scheduled for 2015, notes the expert, interviewed by the PSA.
The only hope is an improvement in the international environment.
S&P also notes the "uncertainty" linked to the possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU, which Brussels conditional on the release of opponent Youlia Timochenko.
"signing the agreement would be positive for long-term trade but there could be negative short and medium-term consequences related to Russia's reaction," S&P explained, which fears Moscow's "commercial restrictions".
Russia, which represents the fourth of Ukraine's exports, has warned that in the event of a free trade area between the EU and Kiev, it should strengthen its border controls for imported goods.
United States green light at the merger Publicis-Omnicom
Publicis and Omnicom said Friday they had received no objection from the US authorities to their merger, thus approaching the creation of the first world advertising agency.
The merger brings together the second world agency, Omnicom, and the third, Publicis.
"Omnicom Group and Publicis Group today announced the expiry of the time limit for examination of the previously announced merger of Publicis Groupe and Omnicom, provided by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended," the two groups announced in a communiquÃ©.
They indicate that they have also received the necessary authorizations in Canada, India and Turkey, after South Africa and South Korea.
The expiry of the HSR review period in the United States and the authorisation decisions issued in the other jurisdictions meet several of the conditions necessary for the implementation of the operation.
"The merger is also conditional on obtaining other regulatory authorizations and the approval of shareholders of both groups," they say.
The Congolese army is after the rebels of the M23
The Congolese army (FARDC) announced on Thursday that its units were going to search for M23 rebels up to their bases in the forests and mountains of North Kivu bordering Rwanda and Uganda.
The M23 appears on the verge of being beaten after being driven out of the north-east localities of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) which he had been controlling since the beginning 20 months ago from the insurrection.
"We're going to pursue M23 and take it wherever it hides because it's criminals," Colonel Olivier Hamuli told Reuters, spokesperson for the FARDC.
We must not let them reorganize because they have been martyring the Congolese people for too long.
The time has come to bring peace.
M23 officials explained that the communities were evacuated under diplomatic pressure, and Bertrand Bissimwa, political leader of the rebellion, stated on RFI that these military reverses would not alter its claims to peace talks.
The latter, according to Ugandan mediators, resumed on Wednesday in Kampala between the Kinshasa government and the M23.
Hangings are reported in the hills that dominate Bunagnana, the last town in the hands of insurgents to fall this week, as well as around Runyoni, a hill where the M23 rebellion took place in 2012.
At their peak in November, the insurgents occupied Goma, head of the province of North Kivu, taking advantage of the flight of the government garrison and the passivity of the blue helmets of Monusco.
The fall of Goma led to the United Nations Mission in DRC, the largest in the world in terms of staff, to strengthen its mandate and to form a rapid response brigade composed of South African, Malawian and Tanzanian soldiers.
For his part, the FARDC Staff was remodeled and the army moved to the offensive against the M23, changing the course of the war.
The rate of progress of government troops is now unprecedented.
"The M23 seems to touch at its end," predicted a Congolese business expert, Jason Stearns, on his blog Congo Siasa.
This would be historic - it would be the first time that the Kinshasa government was able to fight a major uprising.
And it would also be the first time since 1996 that no allied armed group in Rwanda would be present in the eastern part of the DRC.
Experts from the United Nations accuse Rwanda, which denies it poignantly, of militarily supporting the M23, consisting of former Congolese mutants.
British diplomat William Hague invited Rwandan President Paul Kagame to show restraint, announced a spokesperson for the Foreign Office.
Last week, Kigali had referred to the possibility of military reprisals as a result of shells falling into Rwandan territory.
On Wednesday, the inhabitants of Bunagnana invaded the streets of the bourgeoisie to greet the entry of the FARDC soldiers.
"We lived one year with the M23 and it seemed unimaginable to be a day liberated by the army," testified a resident of this neighbouring town of Uganda.
"We lived in terror (from M23), we were traumatized," said this man.
The tests carried out by the Pasteur Institute on a patient suspected of being infected by the coronavirus were negative, the Ministry of Health announced.
He states that "the two cases identified in May 2013 remain the only two cases confirmed in France to date".
On Tuesday, this 43-year-old patient had been suspected of being hit, after returning from Saudi Arabia, a country where the disease has already killed some 50 people.
Chevron, the second American oil company, reported a decrease in its quarterly profit due to the decrease in its refinery margins, while its oil and gas production increased while remaining in withdrawal compared to the group's objectives.
Its net profit in the third quarter decreased to $4.95 billion, or $2.57 per share, compared to $5.25 billion, or $2.69 per share, a year earlier.
The analysts interviewed by Reuters were on average on a profit per share of $2.71.
The group produced 2.59 million barrels of oil equivalent per day during the quarter, increasing from 2,52 million bpj produced a year earlier.
The company targets 2.65 million bpj for this year, with a growth of 25% of the expected production by 2017.
Most of the growth in the coming years will come from its liquefied natural gas projects in Australia.
Because of the cost of these projects, annual investment expenditures increased by $7 billion in two years and are expected to reach $36.7 billion in 2013.
Profits from production activities decreased slightly in the third quarter, while gains from downstream activities (including refining and chemical production) fell from 45 per cent to $380 million.
This decrease in refining margins affects the whole sector.
For example, Chevron's main competitor, Exxon Mobil reported a net downturn on Thursday, despite the increase in its gas and oil production.
School transport: the complaint deemed admissible
From the beginning of the school year, the School Commission of the Sherbrooke Region (CSRS) requires the costs of $150 per student (up to a maximum of $300 per family) for students with two residence school transportation, a service that the organization offers when it is able to do so.
Prior to the changes made to the last budget, no financial contribution was required.
"There is a mediation service proposed by the committee and I was interested," explains LefÃ¨vre.
According to her, the CSRS was invited to mediation and requested an additional period to reflect on it.
"It's always better to talk about it, to get together and find solutions," says LefÃ¨vre.
The School Commission of the Sherbrooke Region (CSRS) did not wish to comment.
The organization only meant that mediation was part of the process in a complaint.
Imbroglio around the closure of the Hotel-God emergency
In the face of the thousands of months-long squabble carried out by some of the staff and trade unions, including the CGT, the Minister of Health, Marisol Touraine, decided on 10 July to "set aside the schedule of implementation of the project, and in particular the date of closure of the emergencies that will not be able to intervene on 4 November".
An official request "not to risk taking emergency care in Paris at the beginning of the winter" but also aimed not to interfere with the PS campaign to a few months from the municipalities.
Despite ministerial instructions, closure should still be effective by that date.
Although the term "transformation" or "continuity change" is preferred at HPPA.
As of November 4th, firemen who had approximately one quarter of the 40,000 annual crossings to the emergency of the Hotel-God will have all received orders to take thirty serious cases a day to the emergencies of other Parisian hospitals.
This date of November 4 also corresponds to the renewal of boarding schools.
At the Hotel-God, emergency staff will leave room on Monday to five general medicine inmates.
With regard to the transfer of internal medical beds, it is scheduled for the month.
"The emergency reception service of the Hotel God must close as soon as possible, and for us, it is November 4th," says LoÃ¯c Capron, chairman of the medical establishment committee (CME) of the HPA, who supports the management project.
"On November 4, there will be no more patients brought by the firemen, only people coming by their own means," confirms Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, the medical officer of the new Hotel-God.
"But we will continue to welcome patients in urgent need," he said, claiming the permanent presence of SMUR vehicles on site to transfer serious cases.
Senior emergency doctors will remain on site, he says.
But it is up to the HRS to decide on the closure of the emergency reception service.
"Things are taking place gradually," said Nicolas PÃ©ju, spokesperson for the ARS for whom, on November 4, "there will be no change in terms of service rendered."
"The minister lied to us or was lied to him," deplores urgent physician Gerald Kierzek.
He resigned from his position as head of SMUR early July for having led the blunder against the reorganisation project, he defined himself as a "warning launcher" in the face of a "cynic" decision taken by "medical-administrative technology".
"They are emptying and asphyxiating emergencies that have been renovated less than five years ago," he said.
For him, "if other Parisian emergency services could absorb surplus, there would be no problem."
But they are regularly fattened.
For example, there are sometimes nine hours of waiting for the LariboisiÃ¨re emergency.
At the SRA, it is argued that thirty "dispatched" patients on several sites are not likely to represent an "avalanche" in other emergency services, whose human resources have also been strengthened.
The "new hospital model" that has already been launched since October 7 is being defended by the HRS as well as by the HPHP, which is expected to continue to accommodate 30,000 to 35,000 patients per year.
By the end of the year, general liberal physicians should also be involved in the establishment of an "absolute stay of care".
"Where do we go if we ask people to self-diagnosis," asks Gerald Kierzek for whom "the concept of non-serious emergency" is "dangerous" and marks a "medical regression".
This is going to happen as for level 3 maternity.
People aren't crazy, they're going to go where there's the best offer of care.
If the Minister does not take any action by Monday, we will change the armrest, warns Christophe Prudhomme, an emergency doctor and a member of the CGT Health.
We are going to be even more present in the municipal campaign and we are going to consider presenting a list.
In the team of Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, Vincent Roger, UMP advisor in Paris and elected from the 4th district, it clearly announces that "even if the Parisian UMP was for the maintenance of emergencies at the Hotel-God, it would be technically and financially impossible to reopen them if we return to the responsibilities".
Ms. Anne Hidalgo, the PS candidate, once again recalled on Monday morning on France Inter that she had voted in favour of a moratorium so that there would be no closure on November 4.
If that were the case, she would make her clear disagreement, said Bruno Julliard, his spokesman.
Although the restructuring of the Hotel-God has its legitimacy on the merits, we cannot admit it without an acceptable pattern of postponement to other hospitals.
Obama stops listening to the IMF and the World Bank
Barack Obama ordered the National Security Agency (NSA) to put an end to her hearings on the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as part of its intelligence activities, says an American leader on Thursday.
This decision is part of the White House's attempt to get back to hand in the NSA's listening case after the revelations made by former analyst Edward Snowden, refugee in Russia.
This is the first time that IMF and World Bank surveillance has been mentioned by the intelligence agency since the beginning of the scandal.
Asked about the subject, a U.S. administration official replied: "The United States does not carry out electronic monitoring of the World Bank and IMF headquarters in Washington."
Speaking under the seal of the anonymity, he did not specify whether such monitoring had been implemented in the past.
Another official told him that Barack Obama had ordered to stop these practices over the past few weeks.
This instruction was given at about the same time as that which ended the hearings of the ONU headquarters in New York.
In this context, the Senate Intelligence Commission approved Thursday a strengthening of controls on government monitoring programmes but authorized their continuation.
The Commission has introduced further restrictions on the data that intelligence agencies are allowed to collect and has imposed a five-year limit for the preservation of this information.
The United Nations welcomes the new poverty reduction goals
The United Nations will now work on a new set of goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were put in place 12 years ago to combat poverty in the world.
Australian diplomats have played a key role in the development of the âsustainable development goalsâ to replace the MDGs, which will expire in 2015, prior to the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development, which began on the eve of Rio de Janeiro.
They included in the final draft of the document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on the eve of the summit that it was now time to "overstep national interests".
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch and appropriate the process of setting universal sustainable development goals (SDGs)," he added.
These DDGs will build on progress made within the framework of the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will do my utmost to fulfil the mandate entrusted to me by the Member States to achieve our vision of sustainable development goals based on the success of the MDGs.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing at the same time as conflicts between powerful personalities
At the foot of the statue of Samora Machel, the founding president of Mozambique, who was toiling them, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo to chant peaceful slogans during a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace to come back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, director general of an investment society.
Concerned about the future of her country, she exchanged her work clothes against a tee-shirt with the mention "we want security" in Portuguese before joining the crowd gathered on the place of the Independence of the capital Thursday.
For two weeks, almost every day there were reports of conflicts between government forces and Renamo, the worst seizures since the peace agreement that was signed more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a famous rebel movement, initially supported by the White-Governed Rhodesia and then the South African apartheid government as part of efforts to destabilize the country's independent government.
After a peace agreement signed in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country should not return to an open conflict, but recent events have shaken foreign investors and the local population.
The challenge is considerable for the growing economy as the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the northwest could attract more than $50 million of investments over the coming years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale do Brasil, Eni d'Italia and Anadarko from the United States.
Frelimo, the ruling party and the main political force since 1975, and Renamo have mutually rejected the responsibility for tensions.
Renamo states that the government is behind the recent clashes and has launched an attack on its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional Renamo bastion on October 17.
The attacks on former rebels then degenerated when government forces attacked the foundations of the Renamo and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, and Fernando Mazanga, the spokesman for the Renamo, according to the Financial Times.
The government makes Renamo responsible for triggering conflicts, and the accusation of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza sought to minimize concerns about instability.
Mr. Guebuza told AFP on Wednesday, the French press agency, that Mr. Dhlakama considered himself a "lost person" who wanted to use "all the strength he had left to try to prove that he could impose his decisions on the government".
Frelimo and Renamo insist that they both wish to avoid war.
But the concern grew after Mr. Mazanga said that Renamo was abandoning the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT he wanted to say that the agreement was no longer respected by Frelimo.
"We want to resume negotiations, but with the greatest seriousness," said Mr. Mazanga.
The previous discussions between the parties have failed to alleviate the tensions fuelled by a series of conflicts this year.
"There are two great men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who keep arguing," said Joseph Hanlon, an open university speaker and specialist in Mozambique.
None of them know how to negotiate well and none of them are willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who is in favour of electoral reforms, had already said that it would boycott the municipal elections to be held in November.
Presidential and legislative elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted its use of force as an attempt by a sick movement to obtain concessions and a treasure of war from the government.
The share of the votes raised by Renamo has continued to decline since 1992, while a new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which was created by a former member of the Renamo, is expected to obtain a greater number of votes in the elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Guebuza â who should retire at the end of his second term next year â wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
"He does not want a multiparty democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the presidency," said Mr. Mazanga.
We do not know exactly what Renamo's capacity is, but it has carried out disturbing flash attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south highway.
Most of the hangings took place in the province of Sofala, which is located several hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but where Beira is located, the port where mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, export coal.
In June, Rio was no longer able to use the railway for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the railway line.
Mr. Mazanga was falsely shy when he was asked if Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique," said Mr. Mazanga.
The instability has strengthened the frustrations of the government, says Fernando Lima, Director of Mediacoop, an independent media society, many people are also concerned about corruption, slow development and the recent wave of kidnappings.
"People believe that the country's future is the government and the president, and that it is the country's responsibility to find solutions to problems," he explained.
Omar Sultane, a protester, said that people only wanted stability.
"No one cares about Renamo or Frelimo, they just want to find peace, they want free access to the roads," he added.
Myths and legends should be taught to children as "lifestyle models," says the author.
Thor's Legend could show that " brute force does not make weight in the face of subtle Russian," while arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Saying that many myths would be "too violent, too outrageous and in some cases too obscene to be taught at school," Crossley-Holland called for a "careful selection" of age-appropriate works.
"I find it amazing that myths and folklore are already part of education in America," he said.
I have been in favour of this project for 20 years.
He added that the fact that authors and teachers are "openly didactic" makes children "fully detect", the messages being "sublimated" in pleasant stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and wrote The Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, said: "You may have good intentions, but you prefer to keep them out of sight."
Perhaps the great difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to offer hope.
Not that everything needs to be simplified or to end well, but there is an innate sense of good and evil.
And it must be sublime; revealed through a story rather than declared.
The known basis of what is shown and not said.
One fighter from the Hamas armed branch was killed tonight and another injured by an Israeli tank shot in the Gaza Strip, was learned from medical and security sources in Gaza.
According to these sources, these activists conducted a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian territory and Israel when they fired an Israeli armoured shell shot.
NSA espionage: the United States is "too far away," Kerry admits.
The United States has sometimes gone "too far" in the matter of espionage, acknowledged Secretary of State John Kerry, in this first confession of Washington in controversy with Europe on the massive collection of data by the National Security Agency (NSA).
After ten days of scandal, revelations and denials between the United States and their European allies, it is the first time that an American government official explicitly admits controversial practices in the interception by the NSA of communications and data in Europe.
"In some cases, I give it to you, as the President has done, some of these actions have gone too far and we will make sure that it does not happen in the future," said John Kerry at a conference in London that he has been participating in since Washington on Thursday, October 31, by video link.
In his speech, in the presence of his British counterpart William Hague, the head of American diplomacy has long justified the practices of information and information collection through the necessary counter-terrorism and prevention of possible attacks.
Invoking the attacks of 11 September 2001, the attacks of Madrid in March 2004 and those of London in July 2005, John Kerry assured that the US authorities had since disenchanted many attacks, thanks to interception of communications and the collection of information.
"We have actually prevented airplanes from falling, buildings from exploding and people being killed because we were able to be aware of these projects," the US diplomat argued.
And, John Kerry said to the Europeans, "I assure you that in this process innocent people have not been deceived."
But we are trying to gather information.
"And yes, in some cases it went too far in an inappropriate way," admitted the Secretary of State, who had already had to express himself on this international scandal during a tour last week in Paris, London and Rome.
He assured on Thursday night that President Obama was "resolved to try to clarify and proceed to a review of these practices so that no one feels wrong."
But the controversy between Americans and Europeans continued this week with new revelations in the press.
According to the Washington Post, the NSA intercepted data from hundreds of millions of Google and Yahoo users.
The newspaper, which cites documents obtained from the former NSA consultant Edward Snowden, states that the program called "MUSCULAR", and conducted with the British NSA counterpart, the GCHQ, allows these two agencies to recover data from optical fibers used by Internet giants.
To believe one of the documents, some 181 million elements had been collected in the last January alone - ranging from metadata on emails, text items or audio or video documents.
These interceptions would take place outside the United States.
But Yahoo and Google have denied any connection to these practices.
For ten days, several major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain or Italy have revealed that the NSA would have massively intercepted data and communications from allies from the United States and their leaders, including German chancellor Angela Merkel.
Faced with the anger of European states and while leaks in the American press claimed that the American president was not aware of such hearings, Barack Obama refused to express himself on this subject, invoking national security.
On the other hand, the employer of the powerful NSA, General Keith Alexander, denied that his intelligence agency had captured tens of millions of communications from European citizens.
He even referred the bullet to the European intelligence services that would have seized these communications before providing them to the NSA.
This would involve "military operations" in countries where these NATO allies cooperate with the United States and this would not be the focus of Europe at all," said General Alexander.
And the controversy was spreading on Friday in Asia.
Indonesia convened the Ambassador of Australia, whose mission is accused of being used by Americans within a vast international espionage network that has also generated China's area.
Paris Saint-Germain will receive Lorient Friday without its master's asset, Swedish Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is injured, announces the League 1 club in a press release.
The PSG, leading the championship in front of Monaco in contrast to goals, released the list of players selected for this 12th day match, without the 32-year-old attacker.
The communiquÃ© simply indicates that it is "blessed", without specifying the nature of the injury.
However, he suffered from left knee inflammation when he returned from selection in the early months.
A ceremony in memory of the cremated dead
The Crematorium of Father Lachaise organizes, at 11 a.m., a lay ceremony, in memory of all the deceased cremated in its establishment during the year.
Anne Hidalgo, a socialist candidate at the Paris City Hall, has to attend and will then explain at a press conference her proposals for funerals.
To follow the ceremony, click here.
For their own obsessions, more and more French choose cremation instead of inhumation: 53%, according to an Ipsos study carried out on 6 and 7 September among 1009 people, instead of 47%.
For the obsessions of a relative, it is the opposite: the French prefer inhumation (53% versus 47%).
If they have the trouble of losing a child, they are only 15% to choose cremation.
In his book La Mort en ashres, Damien Le Guay, philosopher and vice-president of the National Committee for Funeral Ethics, emphasizes the "violence" that constitutes cremation, for survivors.
There is, with cremation, "a violence done to the beloved body", which will be "reduced to a lot of ashes" in very little time, and not after a process of decomposition, which "would accompany the phases of mourning".
There is also "a symbolic violence", which relates to the "cleanness of singularity and distinctive signs" reduced to the "anonymity" of ashes.
Why is what is accepted without pain in some Nordic and Protestant countries still bad in France?
"Because cremation is a new fact," says Marie-FrÃ©dÃ©rique BacquÃ©, president of the Thanatology Society and author of the book Apprivoise Death.
It has been tolerated only since 1963 by the Catholic Church, which has limited attempts to apprehend it.
To learn about cremation is for FranÃ§ois Michaud-NÃ©rard, Director General of Funeral Services of the City of Paris, to plan for the deceased a ceremony as dignified as that to which he would be entitled with an inhumation.
Ipsos' annual survey shows a very strong commitment to the organization of the ceremony.
77% of the French want one, for their relatives, whether religious (53%), or civil (24%).
Now 73% of those who chose a cremation want to organize a ceremony.
66% of atheists or non-believers also want it.
Crematoriums have adapted to this evolution of society.
"For some ten years now, they have been trying to avoid the violence of waiting for families, without doing anything, for an hour and a half, immediately followed by the surrender of ashes," said Michaud-NÃ©rard.
70% of the institutions now offer masters of ceremonies, which, in the presence of the body, proceed to the following ritual: host the assembly, appoint the deceased, connect him to others, evoke him, make sense of his death, organize the farewell.
This has been the case at Father Lachaise's crematorium since 1998.
Ceremony masters are often people who have converted.
There are also former Catholic priests.
It is in this context that Father Lachaise's crematorium organizes, since 2010, the day of La Toussaint, several ceremonies of the memory, secular and non-religious, to which he invites the families of the people who have been cremated in the year.
For the second consecutive year, one of these ceremonies is retransmitted to the attention of those who could not make the move.
The crematorium has allowed us to relay it.
In La Seyne, the relocation due to rats turns to controversy
At the beginning of the week, a family left their apartment on the ground floor of the building Fructidor D2, due to the presence of rats.
In the face of the emergency situation, the Director of the South Habitat Lands Office proposed, exceptionally and provisionally, to house the couple and their three children in a new T4.
However, the family refuses "for financial reasons" and the situation is blocked.
The case took exaggerated proportions, says JoÃ«l Canapa, the director of the Office.
Rats, there's always been in the cities.
The deratisation company performs two passages a year, and we also intervene, at our expense, at every request of the inhabitants.
Thus, since the end of last winter, 64 interventions have been carried out.
The neighborhood is not left to abandon, and rats don't pulsate in the city.
For reasons of environmental protection and public health, deratisation products are four times less effective than in the past, of course, but for two rats, a child will not be killed.
"We didn't invite the rats to our home," says the father of the family who left his home to settle in the hotel.
We are soon without pay and we expect a new home, at the same rate as the old one.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange ends in a fall of 0.88%, News
The Tokyo Stock Exchange ended down on Friday despite good Chinese manufacturing statistics.
The odds were the decline of the dollar against the yen, detrimental to export values and the warning of its annual result launched by Sony Thursday.
The Nikkei index lost 126.37 points (0.88%) to 14 201.57 and the Topix yielded 11.23 points (0.94%) to 1 183.03.
Sony dropped from over 11% to 1,668 yen.
A house preys on flames in Old Quebec
A fire that started on Friday at noon in Old Quebec was quickly controlled.
More than 30 firefighters were dispatched to 9 HÃ©bert Street.
The flames were declared in a three-storey house on four floors behind the Quebec Seminary.
All the tenants were absent during the fire.
The fire was controlled an hour after the firemen arrived, which were many to intervene.
As soon as our first firemen arrived, they really saw apparent smoke.
"Then the alarms succeeded, because it took strength to attack the building, because it is buildings glued here," explained France Loiselle, spokesperson for the Quebec firemen.
An investigation is under way to find the cause of this fire.
Ben Greenman: Tenth Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It could be said that the city of New York is the place where the stand-up was born in America: almost 100 years ago, the actor of vaudeville Frank Fay, who held the role of master of ceremony at the Palace Theatre, on Broadway, began telling jokes directly to the public about the tone of the conversation.
Fay's innovation has continued over the years, until it has been renewed more recently by the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and supervised by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the Carolines stand-up club, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 shows presented in small clubs and major theatres.
"Most of the poster heads emerged in Carolines, and they were very successful, until they became too famous to play in a club," Hirsch said.
We created this festival in order to be able to continue working with them.
This year's event will see the participation of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and the presentation of "Stand Up for Heroes", a comedy and music evening for former fighters, organized in Madison Square Garden, to which will be present, among others, Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
The festival took on scale, just like the comedy world.
Many of the actors participating in this year's festival have been through non-traditional circuits, including shows on small television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll made his appearance on the front of the stage in a sitcom on a cable channel ("The League") on the theme of fantasy football joyfully lasciful of the FXX channel) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate participated in the "Saturday Night Live" and was part of the casting of the "Parks and Recreation" series, but she is even more famous for her series of viral videos " Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Kroll and Slate, as well as other young single-voiced actors (surrealist pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, ironic defender of racial justice W. Kamau Bell), are pure products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the main attractions of the festival this year will be an interview: David Steinberg discussing with Larry David.
Steinberg started as a stand-up actor, but became a film and television director, as well as an informal comedy historian.
Between 2005 and 2007, he hosted a TV Land show called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg".
The meeting takes place at the Hotel de Ville, in central Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the comic DNA of all Larry's work," Steinberg said.
He told me that, when he was here, he sometimes went down a street between two buildings and said, Well, if I lost all my money, maybe I'd come live here.
The oil price continues to decline and approaches $96 per barrel
The price of oil continued to decline on Friday, while concerns about the importance of stocks offset a report showing that the gourmet Chinese electricity manufacturing sector is growing.
The price of the US reference gross for delivery in December fell from 14 cents to $96.24 per barrel at the end of the morning in Europe during electronic exchanges on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
The contract lost 39 cents on Thursday, leaving it with a 5.8% decrease in October.
The high supply of crude oil has weighed on the price over the last few weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy reported on Wednesday that US supplies had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, supplies increased by more than 25 million barrels.
But two reports on the Chinese manufacturing sector arrived on Friday, which show a growth in activity, suggest an increase in demand.
This suggests that China's economic recovery could continue to grow further after growth increased to 7.8% in the third quarter, after a decrease that had not been known for two decades in the previous quarter.
The gross Brent, a reference for the international brute already used by the American refineries, lost 26 cents to fall to $108.58 per barrel on the Inter-Continental Exchange (ICE) in London.
Claim of the Right to Abortion in Texas
A federal court of appeal has restored to Texas certain restrictions on the right to voluntary termination of pregnancy that had been blocked by a trial judge this week.
This judgment means that a law adopted in July in that State and which largely questions the right to abortion will be able to enter into force.
The judgment of the Court of Appeal means that doctors who will practice GIV will have to have a "admission privilege" in local hospitals.
The privilege of admission is the right of a doctor, under his or her status as a hospital member, to admit a patient to a hospital or medical centre in order to deliver a diagnosis or treatment.
Advocates of the GIV argue that the content of the law may result in an immediate closure of one third of state clinics because these clinics have failed to obtain this "admission privilege" for their practitioners.
In total, nearly 22,000 women would be deprived of access to these institutions.
On Monday, a court of first instance had considered on the eve of the entry into force of the law that the provisions dealing with admission privilege were non-constitutional.
But the Attorney General of Texas, Republican Greg Abbott, who is in charge of the governor's position, asked the court of appeal to cancel the first instance judgment blocking the application of the law.
A plenary hearing on this issue is scheduled for January.
The New Star has succeeded in a forced return, alongside audiences, with 1.3 million viewers behind their TV station, which is 5.6% from the audience.
But was the show on the date?
Some 10,000 candidates presented themselves to the hearings of this 10th season, to confront the jury: Maurane, the evil Sinclair, the pore AndrÃ© Manoukian and Olivier Bas.
On Twitter, viewers shared their comments.
After the excitement of finding their favorite program, many were disappointed.
But why such disappointment?
No candidate seems to have really scored on this first premium.
Like every year, the first hearing shows combine a wide selection of weed singers, for the best and sometimes for the worst.
But on Twitter, we want shows, emotions, originality, music...
Fortunately, some found their account there.
There are many who have tried the New Star, and sometimes even gone to the end.
Behind TV screens, successful singer vocations are always there, season after season.
Others just have the ambition to make fun of it.
The Court blocks a decision on the NYPD control and search policy
A federal court of appeal blocked a judge's decision on Thursday calling for changes in the New York Police Department's control and investigation program and questioned the case.
The U.S. Court of Appeal (second circuit) indicated that the decision of Judge Shira Scheindlin was suspended until the outcome of the city's appeal.
The judge had ruled in August that the city had violated the Constitution following the implementation of its programme to control and interrogate citizens.
The city appealed to its findings and corrective orders, including a decision to assign an controller to assist the police department in changing its policy and training program associated with it.
The Court of Appeal heard on Tuesday the arguments concerning the application for suspension.
The Court of Appeal stated that the judge should be suspicious of the case because it infringed the code of conduct of the judges by compromising the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of bias, partly because of a series of interviews with the media and public statements in which it reacted publicly to the Court's criticisms.
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by wrongly targeting black and Hispanic men in their control and search program.
It appointed an external controller to monitor the changes, including policy reform, training and oversight, and ordered the establishment of a pilot programme to test cameras carried out on the body in areas where the largest number of controls are carried out.
In August, the city of New York agreed to end the practice of retaining the names and addresses of persons rejected after police control.
The city's appeal hearing is scheduled to take place after March 14, 2014.
The tactics of control and search have been criticized by many civil rights defenders.
This control and search system has existed for decades in some form, but the number of controls recorded has increased dramatically under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, to reach its highest historical level in 2011 with 684,330 controls that mainly concerned black men and Hispanics.
A judicial action was introduced in 2004 by four men, all from minorities, and turned into collective action.
Supporters advocating changes in the NYPD's monitoring and search program say they will put an end to unfair practices, make it possible to have more effective and trusted police forces, and will be able to change the way police departments use policy.
Opponents say that these changes would undermine the morale of the police without reducing crime, represent a waste of money and would not solve the broader problem of police forces under pressure after the police force has been severely reduced over the last decade.
The judge pointed out that it did not put an end to the constitutional monitoring and search practices, but that it reformed the way the NYPD implemented its controls.
The tenants must go to the vote, as each of them pays an average of $100 per month on the price of the housing that goes to the City tax.
When the owner pays $5,000 in municipal taxes, he divides this amount between each housing.
We are obliged to increase rents to help us pay the new taxes.
When we go to vote, we send a clear message.
We need to change things in the city.
All the candidates told us that they would attack the scandalous debt.
We no longer have the means to pay us fireworks at $100,000, land from $4 to $5 million in case...
Go and vote, that's the best way to express yourself and say that's enough.
End of service for the chef chef of ElysÃ©e
Entered the 500 m2 of Elysene cuisine as committed after working in embassies, the cook engraved all levels until becoming chief nine years ago.
He served six French presidents, from Georges Pompidou to FranÃ§ois Hollande, passing through Nicolas Sarkozy, including on their vacation places, and fed an incalculable number of greats of this world in a near-anonymity that he only breaks today, at retirement time, at 60 years of age.
The man with an open face, deboned skull and intellectual glasses, born on October 24, 1953 at FertÃ©-Saint-Aubin, holds a pastry CAP.
Her mother was a cook herself in a castle of Sologne.
"I have passed from one castle to another!" ironized Bernard Vaussion, who knows not only the manias of the six presidents for which he has served, but also their wives and some of their distinguished guests.
"It is always the head of state or his partner or wife who chooses the menus," he recalls.
"Ms. Chirac was a little more involved, she came straight into the kitchen," to the point that she had forbidden women in ElysÃ©e's kitchens!
It does not displease Heads of State who displayed a relative indifference to terrestrial foods, "they are all greedy", gently denounces Bernard Vaussion.
Jacques Chirac certainly had "a slightly more developed appetite".
But with Nicolas Sarkozy, who had removed the cheese, the plates were empty!
As for FranÃ§ois Hollande, who restored the cheese, "someone likes to eat" and "there's not much he doesn't like."
The current Head of State, who returned the lost kilos before the presidential campaign, has "no specific application".
Bernard Vaussion also remembers the pressure that weighed on his shoulders, especially during state dinners at ElysÃ©e: we need to serve "between 200 and 250 people in about an hour".
The night before is almost white.
These people would not understand that there are mistakes.
The former chef of ElysÃ©e's kitchens, who took a drink Tuesday night with his team, family and friends, leaves with a pinch in the heart."FranÃ§ois Hollande came to greet me."
He said praise.
"His human side has emerged," he says.
The chief will be replaced by his deputy, Guillaume Gomez, 35 years old, who has been in ElysÃ©e for 17 years.
Fire in a house built in 1850 in Quebec
A historic house built in 1850 was the prey of the flames in the Old Quebec Friday at noon.
The four-bedroom building, located on 15 HÃ©bert Street, was the subject of three alarms to the fire department.
The fire went forward, but stood on the three floors of the building.
France Voiselle, spokesperson for the Fire Protection Service in Quebec, said that the rapid intervention of firefighters has prevented the spread of flames to adjacent buildings, a major challenge for this area of the city where buildings are built closely.
The burning house had four dwellings, but no tenants were on site at the time of the fire.
The damage has been very limited, even if the water has caused damage.
An investigation will be conducted to determine its origin, but the saptors have dismissed the thesis of a criminal act.
The Wall Street Wolf: exit of the second trailer
Martin Scorsese lets escape some images of his next film whose role-title, that of an ambitious New York broker, is embodied by Leonardo DiCaprio.
Forget to be reasonable and get your tickets out.
Leonardo DiCaprio will disqualify you in his role as a derogatory trader.
Martin Scorsese tells us the true story of a "long Island stockbroker who refuses to collaborate with the authorities in a vast case of corruption on Wall Street".
In the 1980s, Jordan Belfort then mounted a sling that would make him a rich, very rich man.
The opportunity to follow his incredible ascension, but also the dizzying fall that will follow.
Without limits, man is chained to parties, women, drugs.
Decency and excesses in all kinds are the master words of this crazy story.
The Scorsese-DiCaprio couple seem to have found the magic that had united them in Shutter Island.
The release of the new Scorsese has been delayed due to its too long mounting.
Looks like the movie finally lasts 2:45.
In the hall on December 25, he will be able to take part in the Oscar race.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a pipe
The former editor-in-chief of News of the World Andy Coulson would have used "phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation" to try to confirm a pipe on a link involving the Minister of the Interior then in exercise, Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the Old Bailey court that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with Hannah Pawlby, her "beautiful special advisor."
It was reported to the court that the newspaper commissioned Glenn Mulcaire, a private detective, to hack into Pawlby's voice box and "plant permanently in front of his door," but Coulson also called and left him voice messages.
"The accusation suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor-in-chief of NotW, is not the kind of man to stay in front of the people's house hoping to surprise them, is the kind of man to love presenting history to people to see what they say," said Mr. Edis.
He stated that NotW used three means to investigate issues: phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor-in-chief is personally involved in the third.
It is clear that he is aware of the second, the surveillance, he cannot be otherwise.
What about the first one?
Does he know about phone hacking?
He claims otherwise, but we say "Of course we do."
Rumors about a link involving Clarke were picked up first by NotW's editorial office when a source, experiencing a sexual attraction to Miss Pawlby, said that he had been told: "Don't waste your time with her, she's with Charles."
A band, on which pirated voice messages were recorded on its phone at least three times, was seized at Mulcaire's home in August 2006.
Investigators also found seizures on the private detective's computer that concerned Ms. Pawlby and her sister in a "Projects" file.
During the time the detective investigated her, Ms. Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about her, added Mr. Edis.
In the meantime, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup supervised the monitoring of Miss Pawlby's least facts and actions.
In a voice message he left him on June 18, 2005, Coulson said: "I have a story that we plan to publish tomorrow which I would really like to speak to Charles."
Mr. Edis explained that Coulson's involvement in history followed the same pattern as with other important men, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had faced Mr. Blunkett about a connection with a married woman while he himself was attending the co-defense Rebekah Brooks, who was also married at that time.
Coulson and Brooks have not conspired with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted to having made phone hacks.
Barack Obama receives Iraqi Prime Minister, in the midst of violence
The U.S. president was due to receive on Friday, November 1, 2013 Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki, seeking support from the United States to fight the strongest wave of violence for five years.
Iraq experienced its most murderous month in October in five and a half years, according to figures published on Friday, November 1, by the Iraqi authorities.
964 people died in violence in October, including 855 civilians, 65 police and 44 soldiers, and 1,600 people were injured.
The United Nations provides an even higher balance sheet with 979 dead and 1,902 injured.
These violence is increasingly killing despite increased security measures and large military operations launched for months by the government of Nouri Al Maliki, dominated by Shiites.
The total number of deaths in October was the highest since April 2008, when 1,073 people had been killed.
About two years after the withdrawal of American troops, the level of violence causes fear of a new embrace while neighboring Syria is at risk of a civil war.
Bombs hit markets, mosques, marriages and funerals.
Men are shot in the street or even at home, and security forces are also the target of frequent attacks.
The growing discontent of the Sunni minority, in power under Saddam Hussein, who complains that he has been politically marginalized and that he is the target of unjust arrests, has fostered this outbreak of violence.
On Friday, new violence killed four people in northern Iraq, after the death of at least 26 people in a series of attacks, including the explosion of five trapped cars north of Baghdad.
Much of the violence was attributed to the Islamic State in Iraq and Levant (EIIL), a group affiliated with Al-Qaida (Sunnish extremists), also involved in the Syrian civil war.
Nuri Al Maliki wants a "world war" against Al-Qaida.
The violence is at the centre of the interviews in the United States by Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki who will be received on Friday by President Barack Obama, two years after their previous meeting, on December 12, 2011.
At that time, the President of the United States, elected on the promise to end military engagement in that country, had prepared an optimistic picture of the situation.
Since his arrival in Washington on Wednesday, Nouri Al Maliki has multiplied the meetings with the executive, and the elected members of Congress.
On Thursday, he called for the international community to wage a "third world war" against Al-Qaida.
The principle of increased security assistance to Iraq is supported by influential Republican and Democratic senators.
But the latter also criticized Nouri Al Maliki, a Shiite, who attributed him partial responsibility for the resumption of violence by his "sectarian and authoritarian policy".
They also required Barack Obama to make Nouri Al Maliki understand that "the pernicious influence of Iran within the Iraqi government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship."
Beijing accuses a Uighour group of the attack of Tiananmen
The head of the Chinese Homeland Security accused a group of Uighurs separatists from Xinjiang of being behind the attack on the trapped car that killed five people on Tiananmen Square in central Beijing on Monday.
The vehicle, a SUV, darkened on the crowd that was on the famous square of the Chinese capital, symbol of the murderous repression carried out in 1989, and caught fire killing its three passengers and two passengers.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Political Bureau for Internal Security Affairs, accused the East Turkestan Islamic movement of being the instigator of this attack.
Many Uighurs, a Turkish-speaking minority located in Xinjiang, call this Chinese province East Turkestan.
For the Chinese government, this movement is responsible for the frequent outbreaks of violence that occur there by independent claims.
"The violent terrorist incident that occurred in Beijing was organized and premeditated," Meng told the Hong Kong channel Phoenix TV.
"The group that stood behind was the Islamic movement of East Turkestan," he added, having been echoed by the new Chinese agency.
The Chinese police identified the driver of the vehicle whose name suggests that he was from Ouighore and specified that his wife and mother were with him in the car.
The latter also contained receptacles filled with gasoline and a flag with Orthodox religious inscriptions.
The incident injured 42 people.
The East Turkestan Islamic movement is considered to be a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations.
The Vatican polls on contraception, divorce and homosexuality
The Vatican has undertaken a major worldwide survey of how parishes manage sensitive cases such as contraception, divorce and couples of same-sex people.
The survey asks participants how priests deal with gay couples and their children, and how they treat men and women who live together without being united by the bonds of marriage.
The survey was sent to each bishop's national conference in mid-October, with the aim of obtaining as many answers as possible.
The information will serve an important gathering on the family that Pope Francis plans to organize next year.
The news was reported on Thursday by the "National Catholic Reporter", an independent Catholic newspaper in the United States.
A spokesperson for the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops confirmed that the document was authentic and that each bishop would decide the appropriate way to probe the parishioners.
In the United Kingdom, bishops published the survey on the Internet by asking Catholics to participate.
DRC: Army Attacks the Last Defeat of Rebels Â· Global Voices
The irreducibles of the M23, a few hundred combatants, were cut to close to 2000 meters high on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and Jonba, two localities located about 80 km north of Goma, the capital of the northern Kivu province.
"It has not stopped since this morning, the fighting continues despite the night," said AFP, a Jumba resident, joined by phone around 12:30, and according to which a girl was injured by a bullet in the morning.
"The intensity of the clashes has decreased a little," he added, "it seems that the RDC Armed Forces have pushed the rebels a little".
According to this witness wishing to remain anonymous, the soldiers had "spent the night" in Jomba before going up to the front for a "squeezing operation".
There was a strong sense behind him of small arms and light weapons.
From Bunagnana, political fief and last strong place of the rebellion dropped Wednesday, a PFA journalist could hear heavy weapons detonations.
According to a source at the United Nations Mission for the Stabilization of the DRC, the fighting entered "in a final phase", the FARDCs having "circulated the residual M23 positions to dislocate them".
Since the resumption on Friday of clashes between the March 23 Movement (M23) and the army, Monusco has not been directly involved in the fighting, but it provides crucial support to government troops in the area of intelligence, observation and planning.
At the end of the afternoon, several dozen soldiers, well supplied with ammunition, mounted towards the front line.
They were armed with kalashnikov and rocket launchers.
Earlier, on the road to Bunagnana, border crossing with Uganda, civilian-aided soldiers loaded a multiple rocket launcher mounted on a new FARDC fire truck, to ensure the replacement of another gear driving the positions of the M23 on the hills.
The Congolese president, Joseph Kabila, called again on Wednesday evening the rebels to "demobile voluntarily" under the penalty of being disarmed "by force", but left the Kampala process open, where Kinshasa and the M23 have been discussing since December without results for the moment.
On the spot, M23 political leaders hope to reach an agreement.
"We have completed the talks, it is only up to Ugandan mediation to organize the signature," said Roger Lumbala, Vice-President of the M23 Delegation, without this information being immediately confirmed on the government side.
The M23 was born from a mutiny in April 2012 of former rebels, mainly Tutsi, integrated into the army in 2009 after a peace agreement.
The United Nations and Kinshasa regularly accuse Uganda and Rwanda of supporting M23, which Kigali and Kampala claim.
North Kivu is one of the most densely populated regions of the DRC, and its basement is full of coveted mining resources.
In Bunagnana, on the Ugandan side of the border, where approximately 5,000 people had been refugees between Monday and Wednesday according to the United Nations, the return movement to the DRC which had begun in the morning reversed at noon.
"This morning we crossed over to go into our fields, but the military told us to call us back," said AFP Imelda Nyirankusi, surrounded by his nine children, including a baby on the back.
It seems that gunshots are getting closer to populations.
At the beginning of the evening, dozens of residents crossed the border, some with a mattress on their heads, to spend the night in Uganda.
The musical comedy, this beast of scene
Classical, sophisticated, popular, in English or French, the music and danced productions take over.
After Broadway and London, Paris finally found its voice.
It is a revolution: the French musical affirms itself as a successful genre.
Longtime, from Notre-Dame de Paris to Mozart the rock opera, most of the attempts interfered in the ridicule.
And successes like Cabaret or the Miserables wore the aurole of the mystery.
Jean-Luc Choplin's arrival in Chatelet and Stage Entertainment in Mogador changed the woman.
Today, these two scenes handle titles like successful tubes.
The first one takes over, this Christmas, its excellent My Fair Lady and announces for the following world creation of "Un AmÃ©ricain Ã  Paris".
In Mogador, "La Belle et la BÃªte" could well be one of the successes of the season.
On the other scenes, musical shows such as "1789", "the lovers of the Bastille" and small musical comedies such as "Disco" or "Life and Times" are at the heart of success and quality.
Patrick Niedo, author of the reference book "Histoires de comedies musicales" and lecturer at the Theatre du ChÃ¢telet, analyzes the reasons for the success so severely conquered.
How do French musical comedies evolve?
The offer has multiplied.
First there are the "music shows" that evolve at the pleasure of the producers...
Some use beautiful projection images and a true story as in 1789, lovers of the Bastille.
Others make a 15-year back bond on the pretext that we can serve almost anything when we have Matt Pokora on display.
Then we have the musical comedies with the sumptuous productions of the ChÃ¢teaut that make us revive the golden age of Broadway and discover the universe of Stephen Sondheim, the greatest living composer.
Stage Entertainment popularizes Anglo-Saxon musical comedies of variety by adapting them in French.
Independent French producers are trying to make a breakthrough.
But ongoing projects such as "Rent", "The Baiser of Spider Woman" or "The Spring Awakening" have a hard time being funded.
Do we have enough artists capable like Broadway singer, play and dance?
In Paris, when there are eight musical shows in one season, it's a great year.
We have 200 talented artists who turn projects into projects.
In the United States, the cradle of musical comedy is very different.
Young people are trained in these occupations in many schools.
There are many jobs among regional theatres, tours, Broadway, off-Broadway...
The skill nursery is as important as the number of positions to be filled.
Why are provincial tours so successful?
With the exception of the opera, the province remains the poor parent of culture in France.
Few plays start on tour and it is often a boulevard theatre for adults and not for young adults.
Music shows fill this gap.
These are the same young people who love reality and what it produces as ephemeral stars...
To propose beautiful young men (often talented) as head of a musical show, is the assurance of an enchantment of these girls and often of their entire family.
The Facebook pages of these shows are wisely held by professionals who answer questions.
These shows are very expected when they arrive in a ZÃ©nith province.
The mayonnaise is climbed to Paris and tasted by the provincials.
The show is designed to enter all the large rooms of France in the same form as in Paris.
A serious injury in an accident with a ghost driver on the ring in Brussels
A road accident caused a serious injury on Friday morning around 5:30 a.m. on the inner ring of Brussels up to Hoeilaart, in the direction of Waterloo.
A driver's car was hit by a ghost driver, who is free of charge.
The ring was closed at 9 a.m., at the accident site, the time the road was cleared and an expert determined the circumstances of the accident.
However, this situation did not lead to bottlenecks because the accident took place at the height of the Hoeilaart exit.
The traffic was therefore diverted by this outlet/entry of the ring.
A child badly injured in an attraction in Disneyland Paris
A five-year-old child was severely injured as a result of an accident on an attraction in Disneyland Paris.
His vital prognosis is no longer committed, but he is still hospitalized.
At the time of the fall, the boy was with his father on a boat of the attraction "Caribbean Pirates".
It was closed until further notice.
DRC: Army Prepares New Assault Â· Global Voices
Children play on a carbonized armor belonging to the M23 rebels in Kibumba on October 31, 2013, in the eastern part of the DRC.
The Congolese army was preparing for a new attack on the last bastions of the M23 rebels near Bunagnana in eastern DRC.
The aim is to relocate the M23 of the hills that overlap Bunagnana.
Yesterday, we took the hill of Bugina, which surpassed the hill of Mbuzi.
Today, Mbuzi should fall by herself.
It will only remain the hill of Runyonyi.
"Chanzu's cell is not very strategic," said AFP Governor of North Kivu, Julien Paluku.
Mr. Paluku plans to visit Bunagnana on Saturday.
Political fief and last strong place of the rebellion, this town is located on the Ugandan border, about 80 km north of Goma.
It was resumed on Wednesday by the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo on Wednesday.
Since then, a few hundred irreducibles of the M23 have been cut to close to 2,000 meters high on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, close to Bunagana and the nearby town of Jumba
In Jomba, a resident who had reported close combat on Thursday throughout the day indicated that the situation had been "calm since this morning".
According to him, a woman and her child were killed by the battles of the day before and were buried.
One girl was injured by bullet, and three others were injured, one of which was severely evacuated by the FARDCs, added this witness quoted by the PSA.
Since the resumption of fighting between FARDC and rebels on 25 October, the two belligerents have given no record of the loss of human life.
NSA revelations increase the paranoia of companies with respect to state surveillance
On a beautiful day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew over the British Consulate of Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital.
At the order of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German National Intelligence Agency, its mission was to photograph the roof of the American front-post, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media explained that the BfV hoped to identify the presence of listening antennas and that the operation sparked an exchange between the United States and the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Clapper, the director of U.S. intelligence services, again stressed in September that the United States does not use its foreign intelligence capabilities to " steal the industrial secrets of foreign companies on behalf of American companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits".
But since Edward Snowden, the consultant has become a whistleblower, has begun to reveal his inexhaustible treasure of information on the secrets of U.S. surveillance, European governments and business leaders no longer know whether to believe in the Director.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency spyed on the Brazilian Petrobras oil company and had access to data held by U.S. storage service providers in the Cloud, including Google and Yahoo, have more than ever raised the company's paranoia with respect to state surveillance.
The revelation that the German chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been hacked, perhaps even for a decade, was the drop of water that caused the vessel to overflow.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then business leaders are certainly also potential targets.
Snowden has made intensive collaboration between U.S. intelligence services and businesses transparent.
I believe it is conceivable that these data should be used in their mutual interest.
"Germany must wake up," said Oliver GrÃ¼n, President of BITMi, representing the German SMEs in the IT sector.
German companies believe that the United States represents a risk as important as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to an investigation published in July by the EY Council Office.
However, in all of Mr. Snowden's documents, there is no indication to date that the United States has transmitted industrial secrets from foreign companies to American companies.
Politicians expressed concern about the EU's lack of sufficient IT and Internet capacity and felt that it should strive to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Business leaders are sceptical about this.
A Member of the German Parliament says that we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them...
"It's not the right way to do it," says Hasso Plattner, president of the German enterprise software company, SAP.
If we wanted a strong European IT industry, then we didn't have to let it die 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany, from coal to cars, by farmers.
Everything except the IT industry.
However, the magnitude and sophistication of American spying agencies exposed by Snowden's revelations has been a shock to some companies that until then believed that China was the biggest risk in terms of surveillance.
A major change is taking place in cloud computing as European officials have become aware of the fact that the data stored in the United States are governed by the laws of that jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a professional organization, about 10% of non-American members gave up their projects to use an American cloud storage service provider after disclosures on the U.S. data exploration program Prism.
Jim Snabe, SAP co-director, says: "Our customers are asking us today a question they didn't ask us a year ago: where are my data stored and can you assure me that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction?"
Many German leaders indicate that the latest reports are only a confirmation of what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most precious secrets and that therefore these data must be kept at all costs.
It is not surprising that there is economic espionage.
There's always been.
"It has been a recurring subject for many years and nothing has changed fundamentally in the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, Director General of the BASF Chemicals Producer Society.
The Americans are spying on us commercially and industrially just as we are spying on them, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.
Business leaders are generally reluctant to reveal the preventive measures they have put in place, if this would leave the advantage to an opponent.
Large companies have long been hammering the message that it is at least unwise to recover a free USB key during a professional lounge or leave a laptop unsupervised in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, member of the Audi car manufacturer's board of directors, states that the collection of mobile phones prior to the board's meetings, so that they cannot be used as remote listening devices, has been a common practice for years.
Germany's BfV advises its leaders to consider using simple prepaid mobile phones during their travel abroad due to the risk of damage to smartphone integrity.
The prepaid mobile phones are then discarded.
However, it is feared that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to piracy and surveillance.
In Germany many SMEs are world leaders in their particular niche.
"SMEs often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect their industrial secrets from unauthorized access," the BfV says in a report.
The United States warns its own companies about economic espionage activities carried out by other countries.
The National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) carried out in February by the United States cited France, as well as Russia and Israel, second-degree perpetrators of piracy of economic information, behind China, according to The Washington Post.
One member of the board of directors of a renowned German company believed that when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst."
Bernard Squarcini, former director of French internal intelligence, the DCRI, said in an interview this month: "Services know perfectly well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, spy on their allies."
The parents of a teenager from Georgia who died under unusual circumstances think that their son has been murdered
The parents of a teenager from Georgia, whose body was found in a treadmill in his high school gymnasium, think that their son was murdered, declared the family lawyer Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valdosta to Georgia, was found on January 11 stuck in a supportive carpet standing behind the gardens of his high school gymnasium.
The sheriff of Lowndes County found that Johnson died under unusual circumstances, but the 17-year-old boy's family challenged these findings.
"They are absolutely certain that their son has been murdered," said Benjamin Crump, lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson on FoxNews.com.
They never thought he was dead as indicated in the sheriff's conclusions.
"They think it challenges all logic, the laws of physics and the common sense," Crump added.
They are convinced that these conclusions have been delivered for the sole purpose of covering the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
"They sent their son to school with a signboard and they were returned to a coffin bag," he added.
The U.S. Attorney Michael Moore declared on Thursday that he was conducting an official investigation into Johnson's death, pointing out that several important questions remained unanswered.
What is the cause of death?
Is his death the result of a criminal act?
Moore spoke at a press conference Thursday afternoon.
I'll follow the facts wherever they go.
My goal is to discover the truth.
"I consider that there is a sufficient basis" to open an official investigation," he said.
Moore told journalists that the first autopsy indicated that Johnson died by "positional asphyxia".
However, a second autopsy identified another cause of death, according to Moore.
"A number of questions still deserve an answer or confirmation," he said.
Moore added that if he identifies evidence that would justify a civil or criminal investigation into Johnson's death, he would ask the FBI to conduct it.
The sheriff's office representative from Lowndes County was not available to give us his opinion when we contacted him on Thursday.
A South Georgia judge ordered the authorities on Wednesday to submit all video surveillance records examined by the investigators.
The adolescent's parents stated that they hoped that video images contained clues about the circumstances of his death.
CDC publishes advice on allergies in children to schools
Wednesday, the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention issued a series of guidelines on how to manage children's food allergies in school.
This is the first set of guidelines published by the U.S. government, as the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies has increased sharply.
One out of every 20 children in the United States are currently suffering from food allergy.
The CDC found that the prevalence of food allergies in children increased by 18 per cent between 1997 and 2007.
The guide contains information for schools on how to sensitize teachers and staff to food allergies in children, and how to treat them in the event of an allergic reaction.
It also recommends that schools have a stock of epinephrine â the EpiPen auto-injector being the most commonly used â to be able to react quickly in case of potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
Legislative assemblies of States have recently updated regulations to enable schools to have epinephrine in stock more easily.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms reported by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children can say, "I feel like something stings my tongue," "I feel like I have a hair on my tongue" or "I have tinglings on my tongue."
The NSA case highlights the total lack of intelligence debate
How can we explain the contradictory attitude of the French government, which, on the one hand, is offensive in public by calling the US ambassador on 21 October, and on the other, prohibits the overflight of the territory by the Bolivian presidential aircraft, on the basis of the rumor of the presence on its edge of Edward Snowden?
In my opinion, there are two levels of response from the French government.
When FranÃ§ois Hollande calls Barack Obama or when Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius summons the US ambassador, they react to a true discovery, which is that of the extent of American surveillance over all communications in France.
Is it not surprising to read in the columns of the World a few weeks apart from the reproduction of American diplomatic correspondence and a condemnation of the views of the Quai d'Orsay by the NSA?
Wouldn't it be like a wave of hypocrisy on your part?
The journalistic approach is not a moral positioning, but the search for the interest and relevance of information that allows each citizen to forge an opinion.
When WikiLeaks lifts the veil on the analysis by American diplomacy of political or other issues worldwide, we consider that, in view of the American power, it is an important lighting.
When we describe American interception systems against French diplomacy in the United States, it is in no way to be outraged by this practice, it is to describe the world as it is.
Did France receive information from the NSA about terrorist operations aimed at our interests?
Can we avoid American collaboration?
The development of technology tools that have been very powerful in the United States for ten years, but also in France, has been officially justified by the fight against terrorism.
In this area, in particular, France and the United States have put in place cooperation and exchange procedures for almost daily information, which are described as essential.
For example, the presence of Mohammed Merah in tribal areas in Miranshah was reported to the French through the means of the NSA.
France can, for example, be driven to transmit whole blocks of data on the Sahel region to American services, and, in return - it has already been said quickly - Americans can provide information to the French on other regions of the world.
So the fundamental question behind this NSA case is not so much the ability or right of countries to have interception tools, that the question of the total lack of prior debate, particularly within Parliaments, on the justification of such systems, the perimeter that must be theirs, and, ultimately, the issue of violations of freedoms.
What does the United States really risk? a degradation of their image?
It's nice to report them, I don't see how they can be punished.
The risk of Americans may be double.
The first is when their allies - and this has been the case recently - learn that their leaders, sometimes at the top of their state, have been monitored.
This is the case with Brazil and Germany, two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States have been strained.
Another effect may be more economical: more and more European or South American companies are seeking, in the light of revelations, to entrust their confidential data to American providers subject to American laws, and thus to the possession of the NSA.
Last element: The vast movement of revelations undertaken by media around the world, which helps to engage in a debate on intelligence surveillance practices up to now almost non-existent, could lead legislators, including Americans, to reconsider their powers to their intelligence services.
Parents of intersexual children can choose "undetermined sex"
Germany has become the first European nation to recognize a third sex for infants born with ambiguous sex organs.
The male or female sex of newborns will no longer be assigned rigidly to the birth.
Under the new law, parents will no longer be required to report their children's sex, allowing them to register "undetermined" or "unspecified" sex on their birth certificate.
The purpose of the law was to remove the pressure on the shoulders of parents who could make hasty decisions on sexual reassignment surgery for their infants and to combat discrimination against intersexual persons.
According to the BBC, an intersexual person would have said years later, "I am neither a man nor a woman."
I will remain the patchwork that doctors have created, contusioned and swept away.
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children are born each year, not a boy or a girl.
They are intersexual, the intersexuality that is part of the group of 60 diseases diagnosed as sexual development disorders, a generic term that designates people with abnormally developed chromosomes or gonades (ovaries or testicles) or sex organs.
Wallis Simpson could have been intersexed.
Sexual identification is still not well understood, but most experts in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it is best to use the best available information to attribute it, then wait and follow the child's psychological and physical development before considering a surgical act, if any.
Dr. Jack Drescher, a New York psychiatrist and sex identification specialist, said that the new German law "seems to be a good idea".
Intersexual children pose an ethical dilemma.
"Some people suffer from extremely serious diseases that require surgery, but that is not the case with most children," he added.
It is possible to make a sexual assignment without an operation, and see how identity develops.
The science of how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very precise.
No one can answer the question of why this happens.
It's like the mystery that surrounds homosexual people.
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described intersex persons as different from transsexual or transgender persons, since their status is not related to sex but rather to their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively that of a man nor exclusively that of a woman, but is generally both at the same time and not clearly defined as being either.
These characteristics can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characters (such as muscle mass, pylosity, breast and stature), primary sexual characters (such as reproductive organs and sexual organs) or chromosome structure and hormones.
The report also provided an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in employment, as well as the extent of harassment and violence and prejudice-based crimes.
Young boys of non-conformity now have camps that are specially intended for them.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to register male, female or "third sex" on their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian, Norrie May-Welby, became the first person in the world to have been recognized as "neutral" after winning her appeal trial that allows her to keep an "unspecified" sex for life.
German passports will have a third designation next to M or F â X for intersex, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a report broadcast on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of legislators from this land Catholic country signed a petition for the "Gender theory" to be removed from school books.
The American Catholic Online site also opposed German law, writing that "because the world is dragged into a new realm where gender is a choice but where sexual activity is not one, two other pillars of civilization are reversed."
In Maryland, a baby's mother also told Baby Zone that she would prefer a sex to be attributed to babies at birth.
"The role of parent is sufficiently stressful without additional restrictions, especially if you do not know about your child's sex," she said on the website for young parents.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born without male or female sexual organs were called hermaphrodites, according to the name of the magnificent Greek god who had a double sex.
And just about ten years ago, the medical community viewed the genus as a slate, which can be erased and redrawn.
But now, many people question the ethical foundation of surgery, knowing that sexual identity is complex and that sometimes doctors may deceive themselves, not knowing how a child will feel his or her sexual reassignment when he or she grows up.
"In the middle of the 20th century, this was called a psychiatric emergency," Drescher said.
When these children were born, they didn't call the psychiatrist, they called the surgeon.
The dominant theory of how to treat children with ambiguous sex organs was launched by Dr. John Money of Johns-Hopkins University, who believed that gender is malleable.
He devoted the term "sexual identity" and argued that social and environmental signals â the way parents raise a child â interact with a child's genes and hormones to shape it so that it is identified as male or female.
But in a 1966 case, known as "John/John", his theories led to controversy.
He had advised the parents of a little boy whose penis had been cut off during a broken circumcision to have him castrated completely, also removing the testicles, and raising him as a girl.
"Money presented this as a successful transition, but it wasn't," Drescher said.
At about 15 years of age, he became a boy and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors "always repeat this model."
But in the 1990s, with the arrival of the Internet, those who survived these sex change operations say "they are not satisfied with the result."
This is the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male XY chromosomes but ambiguous sex organs.
The doctors could not really say whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never have a "satisfying life" as a man.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce suffered a surgical ablation of the external organ and testicles and was raised as a girl.
She was given female hormones at the age of 12.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he said on ABCNews.com.
I wasn't happy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he suffered a vaginoplasty.
But depressed and realizing something was wrong, he asked for his medical file.
What he discovered horrified him.
I was sterilized at birth â and no one had ever told me.
Bruce was born with a disorder of sexual development (DDS) that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone to allow his sexual organs to develop.
After learning the truth, he became a man again, following a testosterone treatment and had his breasts removed.
The surgery made her sterile.
Today, he defends the cause of others in an organization called Interface Project, which tries to normalize the perception of intersexuals.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, general director of the non-profit organization based in California Lawyers for Informed Choice, fears that German law "invites labelling and stigmatization".
"Many activists are concerned that German law encourages parents to make quick decisions and give their children an "indeterminate" sex," she said.
We are afraid that it will encourage interventions.
We think it would be better to assign a male or female sex, and wait.
But we have not seen what the law was going to give, so we can only make assumptions.
Tamar-Mattis stated that her organization supported Australian law because "it allows adults to choose to be recognized as third sex."
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about a legal type," she added.
The German law concerns the attribution of sex to birth.
It is not a battle that young children should wage at that age.
When they grow up, they will be able to make decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a radiologist who specializes in mammography in Pittsburgh, whose daughter is affected by a disorder of sexual development and who helps thousands of people in a support group, said that the German law "will hold parents and children responsible".
Dr. Baratz's daughter Katie was born with male chromosomes, but she suffers from a DDS called complete androgenic insensitivity syndrome.
Due to the failure of its androgen receptors, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.
Today, at the age of 29, Katie is married and internal in childhood psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is barren, she hopes to have children through adoption services or carrying mothers.
"The law leaves parents at some latitude so they don't have to make hasty decisions," Baraz said.
This allows them time to do certain tests and understand them, and a time before entering "male" or "female".
So everything is fine â you can raise your child and love him.
You have a beautiful baby and enjoy the pleasure of being a parent.
You don't have to rush for surgery that's irreversible.
"It puts children at the heart of the decision and mitigates the feeling of anxiety that motivates parents because they are afraid not to do what needs to be done," she said.
Finally, the child will decide with what sex he/she feels the most comfortable â and it's something great.
This allows the child to make the decision for himself.
Letta trusting in the longevity of her government
The President of the Italian Council Enrico Letta believes that his government will continue until 2015 despite the strong tensions between left and right within the ruling coalition in the approach of the Senate vote to take down Silvio Berlusconi's mandate.
In a daily interview with La Stampa, the left centre leader said he had "closed intention" to continue to govern with his coalition until the upcoming 2015 legislative elections.
The upper chamber of the Italian Parliament will meet in the course of the month to decide on the fate of the former President of the Council convicted of tax fraud in August.
Silvio Berlusconi threatens to withdraw his support for the government if the Senate, where it has more opponents than supporters, declares its dismissal.
But part of his camp, grouped around the national secretary of the People of Freedom (PDL) Angelino Alfano, continues to support the government, as demonstrated on October 2 his refusal to give in to the demands of Berlusconi who already wished to drop the cabinet.
The L.A. Times reports that a U.S. Transportation Safety Agency, TSA, and a suspect were injured during the shooting exchange.
Firefighters called at the scene claimed to have responded to a call referring to "multiple wounded".
"Order forces are on site," says the airport on its Twitter account, while television images showed people evacuated in ambulances.
"There was a shooting," a spokesperson from the U.S. Transport Safety Agency (TSA) told the AFP.
ABC's local antenna showed a person evacuated on a ramp, and a second was transported on a wheelchair.
The incident took place around 9.30 a.m. local (12h30 in Montreal) at terminal 3 of the airport, also specified the airport.
The Los Angeles Times states that Terminals 2 and 3 are being evacuated.
The spokesperson for the TSA was not able to confirm immediately whether any of its employees were injured.
All flights upon arrival and departure from the airport were suspended.
Israeli Army Kills a Hamas Member in Gaza-Scesses
Israeli tanks shot a Palestinian Islamist Hamas activist on Thursday and seriously injured another in the south of the Gaza Strip, was learned from sources of health services.
One source from Hamas explained that fighting broke out in that region, because Israeli tanks crossed the border and were targeted by your Palestinian mortar shots.
The Israeli army merely referred to a "targeted action" in the area near a tunnel called a "terrorist" by the Hebrew state, dug at the border and whose discovery was announced in mid-October.
Report: Obama's campaign considered to be dropping Biden for Hillary Clinton
The closest advisors to President Barack Obama have, in the greatest secret, planned to replace Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 list, according to the New York Times.
This revelation is the most striking event in Mark Halperin's and John Heilemann's "Double Down: Game Change 2012" campaign book.
The Times obtained a copy of the book to be published and told Thursday night that the President's close collaborators had conducted "in-depth work in groups and polls at the end of 2011" to see if Biden's ban could help Obama with his re-election while his hopes were fading.
According to the correspondent politics of the Times Jonathan Martin, the book offers a detailed analysis of the work of the senior campaign leaders and the White House, namely the former Secretary General of the White House Bill Daley, aimed at measuring what effect the replacement of the vice-president by the former Secretary of State Clinton might have on the election.
The possibility of an exchange is a secret that has been proudly kept within the Chicago Campaign QG and within the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen close advisers from the president â including Daley, the former campaign leader of Obama Jim Messina and the former advisors at the White House David Axelrod and David Plouffe â knew that the change was under consideration.
"Double Down" indicates that Daley took the charge to replace Biden, despite their "close personal links," before finally deciding against the change when the figures showed that having Clinton on the presidential list "did not significantly improve Obama's chances of success."
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had actually planned to replace Biden with Clinton.
"I said that I had examined a whole series of questions, and that was one of them," Daley told the newspaper.
Remember, at that time, the president was not in shape, and so it was said, "Lord, what can we do?".
While Daley called the "concerted" exam, Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that the re-election campaign had invested a lot to find out if the change would be beneficial during the election.
"The campaigns do not spend much money on polls and discussion groups unless they seriously consider taking action," Martin said on AC360.
However, it is not known whether Obama was aware that his team was examining the replacement.
Martin said about CNN that he had asked Daley if his boss then was aware of the eventual remodelling.
Although Daley said he did not think that the President "has been informed" of any change, the former Secretary General admitted that it was "possible" that Obama had known.
Martin added that "Double Down" did not respond definitively to the question of whether the political surveys had arrived at the Obama office.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought that Obama did not know that Biden's ban on the presidential list was being examined.
"Maybe," Martin replied.
You want a fluo ice?
A British entrepreneur created the first fluorescent ice in the world based on jelly.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a luminous snack.
He had the idea after reading a study on jellyfish and convinced Chinese scientists to chemically recreate brilliant protein.
Ice cream reacts with the tongue by increasing the protein pH to make it shine.
Chris explains that since ice cream begins to shine when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, the more you lick, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the ice company "Lick Me I'm Delicious," said: "It's something incredible but we're only at the beginning in terms of production, and 2 g of this thing costs about Â£200."
The protein we use in the ice reacts with the neutral pH language.
So when your mouth warms up the protein, the pH level increases and the ice starts to shine.
We have tested it over the past few months and it seemed appropriate to share it with everyone at Halloween time because it gives an extraordinary brilliant effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice I've ever created because the luminescence of the jellyfish is worth four times the price of gold.
So each ball costs me about Â£ 140.
But she tastes pretty good!
Charlie's experimental company, based in Bristol, is known for its unusual ice fragrances such as beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his next creation is even more ambitious.
He added: "I really want to develop an invisible ice."
It is intrinsically impossible because of the refraction caused by ice crystals that make up ice cream, but I think I will find a way to get there.
Ice uses the fluorescent properties of jelly synthesized by Chinese scientists.
Lou Reed died during a tai chi session
The singer Lou Reed died while he was doing tai chi exercises, revealed on Thursday his wife Laurie Anderson in a letter published by the regional newspaper "East Hampton Star" to the residents of the city of Springs, where the couple had a house.
The artist died last Sunday, at the age of 71.
"He died on Sunday morning, as he looked at the trees and made the famous 21st tai chi movement, with his hands as a musician breaking the air," says Laurie Anderson.
Lou Reed was master tai chi, a Chinese martial art.
The singer's wife also explained that she had promised her husband the week before her death to get him out of the hospital and take him to their home in Springs (Long Island).
Lou and I have spent a lot of time here in recent years.
And even if we're city dwellers, it's our spiritual home.
"He was a prince and a fighter, and I know that his songs about the pain and beauty of the world will convey to many people the tremendous joy of living that he had," she adds.
Lou Reed had suffered a liver graft last May.
Halloween 2013 : In figures
When I was little, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, go to bed late and dress us to go to the neighborhood.
Today, I've become more lazy.
Over the past two years, I haven't distributed one candy, and I certainly won't do it any more this year.
But the states show I'm the Gallic sheep when we talk about Halloween.
The majority of Americans â 158 million of them actually â will celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 million in candy, costumes and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.
What I look forward to every Halloween party is trends.
Dresses are expected to represent $1.2 million of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, inanimate sexy objects are furious.
Women no longer need to be sexy professionals; they can also be sexy food such as pizzas, hamburgers and carrots.
As for men, I expect to see many zombies, thanks to the TV series The Walking Dead, and I bet that the men in Daft Punk's space will be included in our Instagram photos this year.
According to Google, the most sought after costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess it's okay to stay traditional.
We disguised our dogs last year and, to my great surprise, they weren't the only ones.
In fact, Americans will spend $330 million in animal disguises this year, according to the NRF.
It makes a lot of weird dogs dressed in hotdogs.
When it comes to candy, we don't gland.
The Americans will spend $1.9 million on candy this year, according to the Nielsen firm.
This represents about 272 million kg of Hershey bars, sucettes, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark bars.
It's a great news for the 41 million children who go hunting candy in their neighborhood, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.
In fact, we will buy and, we don't tell stories, consume 41 million kg of chocolate during Halloween.
Corn candy is the only thing we don't want to eat; yet nearly 16 million kg are sold for Halloween, according to the National Confectioners Association.
This represents about 9 billion grains of corn.
It's a mystery that I haven't been able to spell out yet.
Nothing is representative of Halloween any more than haunted houses.
They bear the best names, such as "Terror Behind the Walls" (which is actually a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
In fact, there are 1,200 haunted houses officially recognized in the United States, which generate about $500 million of revenues, according to America Haunts, and this includes these amazing photos of you pissing on what your friends put on Facebook and you can't remove and on which a guy you like leaves a comment of the "beautiful head" style.
Finally, let's talk about citrus fruits.
Charlie Brown introduced us to La Grosse Citrouille when we were kids, and sculpting a lantern-shaped citrus, it's like decorating a Christmas tree â it's something we've been doing since we were small.
Fortunately for us, the "baby-citrouille trend" began only last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us carved these potions and did not have to sit in.
This year, the Americans will spend approximately $106 million on citrus fruits, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The lanterns that quietly flirt on the porch of your house probably came from Illinois, where 542 million citrus trees were grown this year.

Royal Bank of Scotland will create an internal default structure ("bad bank") comprising 38 billion pounds (â¬45 billion) of the most risky assets, a measure designed to relax its relations with London and accelerate its reprivatisation.
The bank wants to reduce from 55% to 70% the proportion of questionable assets in its balance sheet in the next two years and hopes to have completely cleaned it in the next three years.
RIB also stated that it would include a provision for depreciation of additional doubtful claims of four to 4.5 billion pounds over the quarter, a writing related to the constitution of the canton structure.
RIB also stated that this internal restructuring would release from 10 to 11 billion pounds of capital, thus strengthening its capacity to lend.
The Bank and London stressed that the "bad bank" would make it possible to draw a picture of the past, with the government in particular being accused of interfering in the management of RIBs.
"We can now move forward, worry about the future and 90% of the assets that make up a really good bank and build a large bank for customers and the United Kingdom," the new Director General Ross McEwan told the press.
Land Rover announces its sponsorship of a series of rallyes
The interior has 6-point bracket seats and harness belts, as well as an Intercom system.
The options include improved brakes, a service that provides access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistical support and storage of the vehicle between two events.
Drew Bowler, the general director of Bowler Motorsport said: "The rallyers who join Bowler have changed."
They are not all experienced, some are looking for excitement and adventure and realistic access to international events.
We are truly happy to offer such an approach in partnership with Land Rover and MSA, and we are convinced that this will be a new way to try different forms of rallying in the United Kingdom and the international, and to prepare for the rigors and realities of the raid rally.
We have had a lot of pleasure to develop the vehicle of the Defender Challenge â the championship will really be exciting.â
In addition, the Defender Challenge will propose a training and testing day in February and the possibility of participating in events in the deserts of North Africa and the Middle East.
Firefighters were called to rescue a lost puppy after being stuck 15 m above the ground on an unstable cornice in a career
Ruby, a cocker Spaniard, escaped after an accident on the road without gravity
She was spotted three days later by a person who was walking her dog stuck in the career
Firefighters came down in remembrance along the cliff to recover the dog and save it from certain death
A puppy had the chance to escape the worst after the firemen were called to recover it safely while it was perched 15 m above the ground on the unstable cliff.
Ruby, a nine-month-old cocker spawn, escaped after a Sunday afternoon road accident and survived for three days alone before being saved in a career on Wednesday.
His owners, Scott Alderson, 25, and his 20-year-old girlfriend Becky Hall, went to Flappit's career in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to find Ruby and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Relief Service.
They desperately sought out their lost dog and appealed to social media sites after she disappeared in the career after an accident with no seriousness.
About 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a person with sharp vision walking his dog spotted Ruby on a corner in the career, stuck 15 m above the ground.
A technical relief team from Cleckheaton's firehouse ran into the scene and descended in remembrance to save Ruby using an animal cider to transport her to the top of the cliff.
Technical Relief Specialist Andy Clayton said, "She was in a precarious situation."
It was in the middle of the cliff, 15 m from the top and 15 m from the ground.
She absolutely did not move during the rescue â she was frozen.
But she's fine now.
She ate cookies after.
It was a very unusual call.
It's incredible someone noticed the dog.
Technical Relief Specialist Peter Lau said: " Ruby was very lucky to get rid of it."
She could have been seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian for control; his general condition was satisfactory, apart from exhaustion and dehydration.
Miss Hall from Halifax in West Yorkshire said, "I was terrified watching the rescue."
I didn't think she was up there first.
It was amazing to have him back in his arms.
The veterinarian said that if she had been exhausted and fainted, she would probably have fallen.
Firefighters were awesome.
What they did was really brave.
We are so grateful to them, each of them has been absolutely formidable.
Mr. Alderson of Keighley added: "We were afraid she would fall but she did not move."
Firefighters were great.
I can't believe she was up there.
Mick Jagger says he never dredged Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview at an Australian radio show this week, pop star said she was a choreist on Jagger's song "Old Habitats Die Hard" in 2004.
Perry said she had dinner with the rock veteran and explained, "I got dredged when I was 18.
She added, "It was a long time ago, and he was very kind."
In a statement on Thursday, a 70-year-old representative of Jagger stated that he categorically denied making advances to Katy Perry.
The representative added: "Perhaps she confuses him with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers to make an appearance during the Rolling Stones tour this year.
His new album, "Prism", landed at the top of the charts this week.
Beijing calls into question an Islamic Turkmen movement
"The behind-the-scenes support for the attack came from the East Turkestan Islamic Movement based in Central and Western Asia," said the owner of Chinese security bodies to a Hong Kong television channel, according to a video posted on Thursday evening on an internet site.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party (PCC), spoke to Tashkent during an official visit to Uzbekistan.
This is the first time a Chinese official has designated a particular organization after the Monday attack.
According to the Chinese police, three Uighurs of the same family in the Muslim-dominant region of Xinjiang, bordering several Central Asian countries, rushed their car loaded with fuel tanks against the entrance of the forbidden City in Beijing, in a suicide attack that caused two deaths and 40 injured.
The driver of the car, his wife and his mother died in the car fire.
The Etim, which declared itself fighting for the independence of East Turkestan, the former name of the Chinese Xinjiang, was classified by the United Nations in 2002 among the organizations affiliated with Al-Qaeda.
This movement is often designated by the Chinese authorities as responsible for sporadic disorders in Xinjiang, but its real influence is questioned by several experts.
George Kerevan: The outbreak of Europe gives the Scottish a choice
Another day, another disturbing story of independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the European Free Movement Area in order to join the EU.
And here we hear stories of passport control in Berwick and a line of bearded wires along the Hadrian wall.
While it is true that the Strathclyde newspaper has indicated the potential economic benefits of greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe, this was not included in the major titles (and was expected).
Nor did anyone say that EU Member States devote much of their time to circumventing their formal rules when it arranges them.
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area for the time being, a continuing non-compliance with the rules would be a thin concession that Brussels could offer in return for everything it wants to get from the Scots.
So this is a story that is not one of them.
And a story so old that it is now fixed: I heard for the first time the fool that "independence means passport control" more than 40 years ago.
However, we have forgotten an interesting point in this interpretation of an old dusty tale.
Why should an independent Scotland follow Europe's instructions, in fact?
Why exchange London's yoke against Brussels, especially now?
Here is the real news about Europe: the post-war plan to unify Europe is definitely at a dead end.
With the euro crisis, Project Europe has officially died.
Throughout Europe, parties opposing the EU or fighting for the abandonment of the euro as a common currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptual Alternative Party for Germany, founded only this year and arrived nowhere, gathered almost five million votes in the federal elections in September and released the Liberal Democratic Party (equivalent to our Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been a national opposition to the project to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has taken a turn.
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, associated with the Carcan on national economies through accession to the single currency, has led many people to believe that the European Project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments that have excessive budget deficits â it was only true for Greece.
Rather, the European system has imposed favourable exchange rates on its members for German exporters â what German politicians want to maintain.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency, the countries of southern Europe face an inherent productivity problem vis-Ã -vis Germany.
The only remedy is to make dark cuts in wages and public spending â encouraged by Berlin.
Beyond the current budgetary and monetary problems, there is a deeper problem of productivity in Europe.
Following the "green" energy policies imposed by Brussels â which are a reason to subsidize French and German energy companies at the consumer's expense â the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times more for gas than the United States.
This is a cost-redepository disadvantage, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All world wage freezes will not prevent the European petrochemical industry from being penalised by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, the revolt is spreading, particularly in France, one of the EU's leading leaders.
After the war, the French political elite considered the EU to be a means of controlling Germany and putting Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport of its political legitimacy and imposed its own economic policy in Europe, allowing the French economy to go wrong.
As a result, the extreme right party of Marine Le Pen, the Anti-European National Front, has just won a crucial by-election, sending socialists back to power in third place.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the votes â a timely warning for the British Labour Party which reminds it that it cannot start from the principle that a split on the right will automatically favour the left.
What does Marine Le Pen do with its new popularity with the French white working class?
It wants to use next year's European elections to create a single and anti-European anti-Money bloc within the European Parliament.
If the anti-European parties are well represented in these elections, which is quite possible, such a block could control the European Parliament for the first time.
This is what I think: very soon, the anti-European and anti-currency feeling in Europe will unify and eventually kill the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will return to something more similar to "the Europe of Nations (Sovereign)" free privileged by the General of Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economies could retain the euro, but France and southern Europe will get their own currency back.
I expect the United Kingdom to take its distance from this project, and I hope it will make its eyes soft in the United States.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left on its own in the Atlantic.
What about Scotland?
We can decide to be a small area of England (essentially).
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which includes sending us to Berlin and Brussels.
I believe that Scotland could accommodate a more free European agreement provided we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other countries with similar views would be easier in a Non-Federal Nations Europe.
Otherwise, we should imitate Norway and retain our economic independence.
The SNP government of Scotland is â and it is worth noting â the most successful anti-austerity political movement in Europe, since it won a spectacular majority in 2011 based on its opposition to the dark cuts proposed (and implemented) by the Chancellor of the Labour Equity, Alistair Darling, and the conservative/liberal-democratic coalition that followed.
It would now be ridiculous for Scotland to vote for independence if it were to accept austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Older
Studies show that African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty age earlier than white girls.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is imminent
Nothing proves that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that the obesity epidemic could be a trigger for early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is not as pronounced in boys
CNN Pat Etheredge's former correspondent is a journalist who specializes in family and child health issues.
Does a mother have to worry if her daughter's breasts and pubic hair begin to grow to 7 or 8 years old?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics held this week in Orlando, Florida, Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, pedocrinologist, explained that these early physical changes are quite common among young Americans and represent a new standard.
"I spend a lot of time reassuring parents â in general, this does not indicate a rapid evolution towards full puberty," Kaplowitz said.
The obvious signs of development, such as breast budging, hair under arms and in the pubic area and body odors, appear earlier among girls.
But there has been only a slight advance in the age of the first rules over the past four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12 and a half years, when it was 12 and a quarter in 1970.
"Once the chest has begun to develop, it takes at least two or three years before the first rules appear," said Kaplowitz, also the author of "Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem".
Time is the most accurate test to know how puberty will evolve.
There is a debate about what constitutes the real appearance of puberty, but it is considered "early" when breast development is accompanied by sudden growth before the age of 8.
In most cases, development slows down or stops â it is something a pediatrician can follow closely.
Faster evolution can justify endocrinologist tests to avoid serious problems such as tumours or cysts.
There are treatments to delay the appearance of the first rules and prevent other consequences: premature aging of the bones that can slow growth and small size to adulthood.
Recommendations on drug and hormonal treatment are based on child age, development rate, growth rate and emotional maturity.
The psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is careful with drugs but recognizes that "controlling puberty can mitigate some behavioural problems and the feeling for girls to be different from others."
The other big problem is understandable: Parents simply don't want their very young girls to have their rules.
"They fear the risk of pregnancy or even how they will manage hygiene issues," Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock," recalls a woman whose daughter had her first rules at 10 years of age.
Although there were signs and we talked about the rules, it was not emotionally prepared.
She returned from school frightened and troubled to be the first of her friends.
There are many theories brought to public knowledge about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no coherent theory that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sex messages from the media are responsible.
Boys, like girls, reach puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz claims that the most credible hypothesis is that of the obesity epidemic.
He participated in a study on girls aged 6 to 9 who linked the percentage of fat to the onset of puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other influential factors.
In that country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty age earlier than white girls.
There are various explanations.
Globally, early puberty mechanisms appear to be influenced by everything, from economic to climate conditions to genes.
Another problem: Although boys have hair on their faces and in the younger pubic area, the trend towards real early puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other physicians participating in the APA conference stressed the complexity of the subject.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common, even among infants and young children.
"We need to be careful about how we identify the real appearance of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pedocry-endocrinologist working at Goryeb's Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to ask their pediatricians for advice on how to talk to their children.
"This may mean having a conversation earlier than planned," Kaplowitz explained.
If you stay calm, your child will react well in general.
Girls whose puberty is early must be reassured that, even when it happens earlier than expected, the process is part of life.
The tribute to the folk of the Coen brothers
"Inside Llewyn Davis" by the Coen brothers, Grand Prix of the last Cannes Festival, is a nostalgic and funny film on the 1961 Greenwich village and folk music that just started to resonate, before Bob Dylan arrived.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose filmography had just been the subject of a retrospective at the French CinematÃ¨que, had spread the Golden Palm to Cannes in 1991 for Barton Fink.
In the absence of being able to hire Dylan or the trio Peter, Paul and Mary, Joel and Ethan Coen have thrown their deployment on the top star of American cinema, Oscar Isaac, 33, but also on the pop planet star Justin Timberlake.
In this moody movie where music is a central character and live songs, Oscar Isaac shows himself a accomplished folk musician and singer, while Timberlake, his friend in the film, leaves pop for folk music with a contagious jubilation.
As for Carey Mulligan, she left Daisy Mulligan's rich surroundings in "Gatsby the Magnificent" for less bright clothes, a soft voice when she sings, but the swearing owed to the machine gun when she speaks.
"Inside Llewyn Davis" tells of one week the tribulations of a folk singer who can't get through and get angry with the whole earth.
He agreed to withdraw the replacements at the feet raised in the studios.
Without housing, he toured the sofas of his friends who still wanted to receive him.
A documentary air
"His relationship with success is tortured, that's what we were interested in: a mix of malaise, a guy who's not there at the right time, who's not a careerist but integrated, with self-destructive behavior," declared Ethan Coen, crowned with his brother Joel of several Oscars and prizes in Cannes.
If Llewyn Davis did not exist, the two filmmakers fans of folk music built their story on real personalities of the time like folk musician Dave Von Ronk.
The idea was to show the moment before the advent of Greenwich village, this neighborhood of New York called to become "the epicenter of the rise of folk music that would generate international stars" as journalist Elijah Wald, friend of Van Ronk.
The film then takes copies of the documentary, the 33T-invented dusty music label, inhabited by an old unpaid secretary, the musical choices of the studios of the time and the cafes where the singers were produced.
The magic of the Coen brothers still works by integrating a funny character who crosses the film permanently: a beautiful red cat with a cracking look, Llewyn Davis' fortune companion.
Questioned about how he composed his character, the actor and singer Justin Timberlake recalled having "great in Tennessee, bathed by blues and country".
"My first music lessons were given to me by my grandfather who taught me how to play guitar," he added.
For Justin Timberlake, if the work is necessary to "be considered good", "the chance can also launch someone's career", and "more and more today".
Like Llewyn Davis, who refuses to compromise on her music, the pop star explains that in a career, "the most important thing is not to get caught by anything that can prevent us from expressing ourselves."
GÃ©rard de Villiers, the author of "SAS", died.
He'll never know the word "retirement."
Phenomene of the French edition, GÃ©rard de Villiers, who died on Thursday at 83 years old, had just published his 200th SAS, "La Vengeance du Kremlin".
In February, the New York Times had dedicated it as "the author of spy novels that knew too much."
He had just spent ten days in Afghanistan, a theatre of 198 and 199th opposites of the famous series of spy novels.
Reduced physically by a very serious heart accident in December 2010, he was travelling on this trip with a walker.
Before Afghanistan, he had also returned to Libya, Russia, Lebanon and Mali.
With four SAS published annually, GÃ©rard de Villiers, born on December 8, 1929 in Paris, made sure to ignore the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the publication of "SAS in Istanbul", the first of the series, almost half a century ago.
"Surely between 120 and 150 million all countries are confused," he said last March.
His Burmese cat on the knees, in the living room of his huge apartment of a building on Foch Avenue a few steps from the Arc de Triomphe, the malicious eye under his white hair, he cited some of the languages in which the adventures of SAS were translated: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Japanese or Korean.
"Without counting pirate editions," he added, designating a pile of books on the low table between bronzes or ivory reported from the 130 arpent countries to place his novels there.
For the price of a pack of cigarettes, the reader is entitled to the traditional cover with the photo of a young woman with the advantageous chest, carrying a gun or a assault rifle.
Inside, his serene Highness (SAS) Prince Malko Linge, a disarrayed Austrian aristocrat and a contract agent of the CIA to pay for the repairs of the family castle, throws himself into the kits of all the wicked of the earth, communists of the 70s and 80s, then jihadists from the 1990s.
In each book, the same recipe: a large dose of geopolitics and exoticism, some scenes of hard sex, a zest of violence and torture.
"I never pretended to be a literary author," explained GÃ©rard de Villiers.
I consider myself a storyteller who writes to distract people to whom I don't send a message.
He worked "like the great reporters of the pre-war type, Albert London, who went on site and returned with real and long investigations."
SAS' father said "make a kind of geopolitical leaf".
"I am constantly my files (Afghanistan, Syria, ...) before leaving," added GÃ©rard de Villiers.
On the spot, I meet journalists, including those from the PFA, diplomats, people from the services I have known for some twenty or thirty years.
As a result, many of its SASs are often pre-monitory: so, a month before the attack of a command center of the Syrian regime that killed several senior officials, he had told the story in "The Way of Damascus".
In "Les Fous de Benghazi", he had been the first to reveal the existence of a secret CIA command centre in this city, the cradle of the Libyan revolt.
In 1980, he staged the assassination of Egyptian President Anuar El-Sadate in "The Conspiracy of Cairo", a year before the attack.
In October 2012, in "Panique Ã  Bamako", he reported the columns of 4X4 jihadists that were based on the capital of Mali.
I'm not guessing, GÃ©rard de Villiers was defending himself, I'm just making assumptions from countries I know well and, from time to time, some of my assumptions come true.
After these trips to frequently disturbed areas, he settled for a month behind his marguerite IBM writing machine dating back to 1976 "all the pieces have been changed".
300 pages later, he wrote the word "FIN" and corrected each page to the pen.
At the walls of his office are attached AK-47 assault rifles, erotic photos and photos of the author with African warlords.
Regularly pinned for machismo by feminist leagues and for racism by human rights organizations, GÃ©rard de Villiers dismissed these accusations in two sentences.
Some women are sexual objects in my books but others are beautiful, intelligent and courageous women.
I am always well received in Africa where I have many readers.
GÃ©rard de Villiers had said, "Malko Linge, like all heroes, is not old."
He won't die and not retire.
No more than me.
Airplanes argue about the width of seats while large orders are at stake
The dispute rages among the great aeronautical manufacturers about the width of the tourist class seats on long-run flights, opening the way to a bitter confrontation at the Dubai aviation fair that takes place this month.
The conflict concerns the width of the seats proposed on long-running flights to passengers of the economic class â which are not always the most brokered by airlines, but to which the allocated space is essential to increase efficiency gains in the latest aircraft submitted by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week, Airbus called on the aviation industry to put in place a standard imposing a seat size of at least 18 inches (45.72 cm) in economic classes, but its major American rival Boeing states that it should be up to the airlines to decide.
The dispute broke out as the aircraft sought to sell even larger versions of their bimotor long-running aircraft, possibly hoping for a record of orders during the event that would take place from November 17 to 21.
The way the seats will be placed at the rear of the plane â in particular, there will be 9 or 10 front seats â is essential for the economic performance of the mini-junk segment.
Boeing states that its renovated "777X" will be able to accommodate 406 people in economic class in seats of more than 17 inches wide, and will be configured with 10 seats per row.
Airbus indicates that the competitive version of its A350 will carry 350 people in economic class in 18 inch wide seats configured in rows of 9.
Aeronautics giants often exchange hits on technical issues by advertising in the professional press.
Today, Airbus calls it directly to the public before the Dubai Air Show, where 777X should take steps on its competitors with more than 100 orders.
We have recently realized what could be the beginning of a new advertising war with the presentation to financials of a photo showing three people against each other at the restaurant, entitled "Would you accept that?".
"Boeing offers long-running flights in narrower seats than in regional turboprop aircraft," said John Leahy, Commercial Director of Airbus.
As eating habits change, people grow, but seats in planes have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when Boeing's Jumbo 747 defined the modern long-run trip, and the turn of the century, the average American's weight rose from 40 to 49 years, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health.
The size round of the average American of the twenty-first century is 39.7 inches, according to American health statistics.
Airbus states that his rival is attached to a concept of seat dating from the 1950s, when the circumference of the newly named jet set aircraft was narrower.
Airbus adds that it commissioned a study indicating that an additional inch at the seat width would improve sleep quality by 53%.
Boeing contests Airbus' figures with regard to the width of seats and claims that it is not for manufacturers to decide how airlines balance the price of tickets and equipment.
He also said that the study shows that the cabin experience does not depend only on the width of the seats.
"It's really about bringing flexibility to airlines and allowing them to do what they think they have to do to carry out their activities," said Kent Craver, in charge of passenger satisfaction at Boeing.
They don't want to be told what will make them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, it is more about having a certain freedom of movement, but for suppliers it is increasingly a question that could affect their results.
Behind the dispute is a race to aircraft orders for an estimated amount of at least $700 million at market prices in the coming decades, enough to make the balance of US and European exports weigh.
As Reuters indicated for the first time in July, the configuration of the seats is exactly what fuels the battle between the latest devices.
Airbus and Boeing both claim a performance per seat in their latest models of long-runners 20% higher than that of the market leader in this segment, the 365 seat Boeing 777-300ER.
The performances announced by Boeing depend in part on the comparison between the 777X configured with 10 seats per row and a 777 original model configured in rows of 9.
The unit cost gain is low compared to the device configured with 10 seats per row currently in service.
"Boeing does this to allow us to break more seats and make his planes more competitive than our products," said Kevin Keniston, Director of Confort Passenger at the European Airbus aircraft.
On the other hand, analysts say that cabins configured with 10 seats per row in the existing 777 suggest that many passengers speak in favour of a denser configuration, which can go in pairs with cheaper rates.
"An 18-inch seat width would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that, from a commercial point of view, Airbus' proposal is motivated by the 777 threat," said the interior expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor-in-chief of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but offer a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines have to choose.
Aeroplane sellers who tour the world even take a meter with them to check the competing configurations.
While offering comfortable appliances, all manufacturers also offer high-density aircraft to low-cost airlines and regional travel.
Airbus offers an A350 configured with 10 seats per row but indicates that it has not yet sold it.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the need for greater customization of cabins by offering larger side seats on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other major manufacturer of modern large appliances, experts say that it is unlikely that his appeal to the aeronautical industry to set up a size standard for seats will result, but that it could cause the sales wave of 777X to be forgotten.
Oracle shareholders irritated by Ellison's salary
A majority of Oracle shareholders voted Thursday against the proposal for compensation for the founder and general director Larry Ellison, in view of the financial performance of his group.
The vote is not binding but the image of Larry Ellison, the third world fortune just augured from the victory of his boat at the Cup of America comes to an end.
The billionaire still owns 25% of the capital of the software group he co-founded 40 years ago.
Last year, Ellison had had a negative vote on her remuneration.
The owner of Oracle gave up a $1.2 million bonus for the 2013 fiscal year closed in May due to the poor performance of the group, which missed its growth goals, but he collected approximately $77 million related to stock options.
His fixed salary is only a symbolic dollar.
On the whole of the 2013 fiscal year, the net profit of Oracle increased by 3.5% while the stock exchange rate of 27.5%, overperforming the S&P-500 index that took 24% at the same time.
The new anti-nicotine vaccine could eliminate smoking pleasure
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could eliminate the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
Only one dose of the vaccine was able to protect the mice from nicotine dependence.
Other tests are needed before starting human testing, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical College of New York stated that the first signs were encouraging.
"We really hope that this kind of vaccination strategy will help millions of smokers who have tried to stop, exhausting all the methods available on the market today, but find that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches," said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to transport the genetic information needed to design anti-nicotin antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begins to produce a regular flow of antibodies.
The antibodies trace all the nicotine molecules present in the blood system and neutralize them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from having its nicotine dose.
During the tests, the vaccinated mice to which nicotine was subsequently given continued their activity normally.
But the mice who had not been vaccinated "were calm," said the researchers, indicating that nicotine had reached their brain.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines were found to be ineffective because they contained antibodies.
Injections had to be repeated so frequently so that antibody levels remained high that they were too expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower as it turns liver cells into antibodies.
Professor Crystal stated that if the future vaccine for human use was completely safe, it could be administered to children before they are tempted to try a cigarette, which would prevent any addiction to nicotine.
But it is more likely to be used by smokers who want to stop smoking.
"They will know that if they start smoking again, they will not enjoy it because of the anti-nicotine vaccine, and this will help them to lose their bad habit," he added.
British scientists stated that the results were interesting but indicated that much more thorough research was needed.
Pakistani Taliban chief killed by a drone
Pakistani Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a hit by an American drone in Pakistan on Friday, learned from security services.
The death of Hakimullah Mehsud has been announced several times in the past.
But intelligence officials, the army, as well as the activist movement said this time that he had lost his life in this blow, carried out in the North Waziristan region.
"We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a drone shot," said a senior security officer.
Earlier, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, on his way to London, had informed the British Government that discussions had been held with the Tehran e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Pakistani Taliban movement.
Tripodi refuses to be influenced by Obeid
The former Labour Minister of New South Wales Joe Tripodi will be investigated by the State Anti-Corruption Regulator.
The former Minister of New South Wales Joe Tripodi refused to change the commercial lease policy at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three assets located in the government-controlled area.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation to see if Mr.Obeid had pressured several state ministers to renew his leases in Circular Quay, where the Obeids owned two restaurants and one coffee, after their expiry in August 2005, without any invitation to tender.
She now investigates the allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obeid's secret interest in these properties, following the testimony of the former Deputy Secretary General of Mr. Tripodi, Lynne Ashpole, Thursday.
During the years of discussions that began in 2005, the government pressured the leases to be the subject of an invitation to tender.
The tenants were against and also wanted longer durations.
In 2009, the leases for Circular Quay companies, which reported to Obeid approximately $2.5 million a year, were renewed without any tenders.
Mr. Tripodi, who served as Minister of the Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of tenders.
But he refused to change his policy at the request of Mr. Obeid, who, he recognized Mr. Tripodi, called for a change in government policy on leases.
The transcription of telephone conversations presented to IAC showed calls made in August and September 2007 between Mr.Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had arrived at the Department of Ports after working under the orders of Mr.Obeid at the Department of Fisheries.
"Was the subject discussed during these telephone conversations the development of the commercial lease policy?" asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy to Tripodi.
"No," replied Mr. Tripodi.
I don't remember what we discussed, but anyway, it wasn't that.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli warplanes targeting Syria, says a leader
Israeli warplanes have reached a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia Thursday evening, confirming a military officer at Fox News.
The manager did not specify the target, but said there was at least one.
The Associated Press reported that the target was Russian manufacturing missiles SA-125.
At least twice this year, Israel carried out air strikes against missile shipments in Syria.
Foreign workers in possession of a visa 457 may have to pass an "authenticity" test
The government is currently studying the possibility of establishing an "authenticity" test for foreign workers with a visa 457 while it is considering extending the law enforcement measures.
The test, if adopted, would be applied according to a criterion designed to prevent 457 visas from being used to occupy unqualified positions or as a detour to bring his family and friends to Australia.
A government working paper was unveiled today while Labour MP Maxine McKew denounced the government's speech on foreign workers, saying that it could offend Australian neighbours.
"Failure statements on "foreigners returning to the line" and "jobs for Australians first" are an unpleasant return at the time when trade unions demanded a protected labour market," she told Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that the work of the Whites had to be protected â and I would not be surprised if some countries in the region saw it as an echo to this historical artifact.
The working paper refers to the 12 measures previously envisaged by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
The Minister of Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka to meet senior officials to discuss trafficking in human beings, has implemented five of the recommended changes, while the others are under review.
If the "authenticity" criterion was adopted, a visa applicant could be checked for "if the job offer is authentic in case the candidate is a personal relationship or associate of the owner or person concerned within the sponsoring company".
Companies may also be required to report the number of visa holders 457 after some of them, having intended to sponsor a small number of workers, have in fact used hundreds of them.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker would have died of a heart attack after arriving on a boat carrying asylum seekers to Christmas Island this week.
The crowded son of the man, aged nine, went to Australia with him and found some comfort since his father's death on Wednesday with an adult cousin who was also on board.
The man was transferred urgently by the Australian authorities to the hospital on Christmas Island, where he died.
A study aimed at increasing the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland was launched by the British Government.
The work carried out by HS2 Ltd suggests that high-speed services to Scotland and northern England will start from the opening of Phase 1 in 2026.
Barone Kramer's Minister of Transport stated that the project "would bring together the United Kingdom".
The Scottish Minister of Transport, Keith Brown, said he was "excited" to work with the British government on the project.
Phase 1 will focus on a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When Phase 2 is completed, the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of the construction of the high-speed link between London and northern England from Â£32.7 to Â£42.6.
The British Government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, asked HS2 Ltd to study the strengthening of railway capacity and the improvement of the journey duration for northern England and Scotland.
This should include the possibility of travel between Glasgow and Edinburgh for up to three hours.
Barone Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is on a truly national network that will bring the United Kingdom and its cities closer together."
We push the HS2 project because the benefits it presents are enormous.
Without him, we are faced with a problem of capacity of our railway network.
But it is also about developing connectivity between the 18 major British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, so that the links between them are better thanks to HS2.
British Secretary of State for Scotland Alistair Carmichael added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr. Carmichael to support the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown stated: "The high-speed train has the potential to offer considerable economic benefits to Scotland, but it also brings Scotland's economic weight into the overall high-speed rail network project throughout Britain.
"We are therefore excited to work in partnership with the British Government to examine the options to bring the high-speed train network to Scotland, creating an advantage for all and complementing the Glasgow-Edimburg line that the Scottish government is already planning.
"I look forward to reading the review report with British ministers next year and we will then decide together on the next steps."
The rules on the use of electronic devices on board are currently in force in Australia
Australian air passengers will have to continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing despite the United States gesture to ease electronic device regulations.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has left the door open to American carriers for a change in their procedures so that passengers can read electronic books, watch videos or play games on their devices during critical flight phases provided they are in "air" mode.
Passengers can already do so during most of the flight, but many people find it difficult to access their e-books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers review the decision that obliges American carriers to do important work to meet the requirements, but indicated that they do not immediately intend to change their procedures.
Civil Aviation Safety Authority also stated that it was reviewing the announcement but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical flight phases were still in force in Australia.
"The CASA does not have specific regulations governing the use of electronic aircraft," she said.
The issue is regulated by which aircraft operators are required to ensure that safety is maintained permanently and passengers comply with the safety requirements given by crew members.
Virgin, who has already told CASA of her intention to expand the use of her on-board entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology, was open to change, but said she would follow the regulator.
"We would welcome a revision of the CASA that would allow the use of electronic devices because we really think it would improve the customer experience now that we have (of the entertainment system on board using Wi-Fi technology) on our aircraft," said a spokesperson.
Qantas stated that she was in compliance with the current rules for the time being.
"In accordance with our current policy, electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and we do not immediately intend to change this," she said.
The FAA decision applies to US airlines.
However, we are always interested in the regulatory developments that could benefit passengers, and we will examine closely the FAA decision and the reasons for it.
For American carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from one airline to another and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from electronic devices, as well as review manuals, training equipment, hand luggage transport programs and passenger instructions.
"As soon as an airline has verified its fleet's tolerance, it may allow passengers to use light portable electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at all altitudes," said the FAA.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will ask passengers to turn off their aircraft during landing.
The group also recommended that the heavier devices be safely stored under the seats or in the upper compartments during take-off and landing.
Pia: at least four wounded in a violent fight
The small municipality of Pia experienced an unusual excess of fever Thursday evening.
Three gendarmerie vehicles, two ambulances and a catch of about thirty people according to the testimonies collected...
On this Halloween day, the evening was agitated on the side of Pia where a rix involving several people broke off on the side of the Post.
At least four minor injuries would be to be mourned.
Alerted, the gendarmes went to the scene to separate the belligerents and to ensure that the wounded were taken care of.
Singapore's bonded lenders take advantage of the middle classes forced to tighten their belt
In a pledged lender at the Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga deposits a bracelet, ring and pair of gold earrings to pay for her daughters' tuition fees.
"My husband and I just bought a house so all my money went in," says Amirthalinga.
Although she earns $3,000 from Singapore ($2,400) per month as an administrator and her husband also works, monthly family income is not enough, she says.
In fact, the demand is such in some parts of South-East Asia â where household debt increases â that ValueMax, where it has made its transaction, has become this week the third pledged loan company to be introduced into the Singapore Stock Exchange.
Making jewelry is not just a quick way to get cash â $1,300 from Singapore in the case of Mrs. Amirthalinga â but it's almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
In general, Singapore's pledged lenders raise an annual effective interest rate of 17 per cent, just above the 15.4 per cent offered by the United Overseas Bank, a local funder with a branch in the same mall.
However, lenders on a pledge have the advantage of not applying for solvency or salary proof, and can unlock loans faster than banks.
As a result, millions of people across the region turn to borrowers on a pledge, while families feel the pressure of increasing the cost of living and overindebtedness of households and consumers.
After five years of strong growth since the global financial crisis, and cheap credit fuelled by a too laxist monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and medium-income families turn to borrowers to fill the gap while their economies are slowing down.
This week, the Standard & Poor's rating agency cited the growing debt of households, mainly due to the increase in mortgage loans, as a risk factor for the solvency of Asian banks.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore recorded the highest debt ratio of households/gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80% of GDP, while this rate was 60% in 2008.
Economists also fear the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which came out of a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, data showed a continuing weakness in exports and a slowdown in consumer demand.
"The balance sheet is that with rising costs, people in the middle or at the bottom [wages scale] are trying to complete their incomes as they can," says Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historically high gold prices over the past two years have led people to hasten their personal effects to reach the cash value of their jewelry.
In Singapore, about 70% of the items in the 200 state-owned lending shops are in gold.
People say, "The gold price is high, let's take over the mother's gold chain and we'll come back for it next month."
In Thailand, EasyMoney's largest loan shop operator, has recorded a 20% increase in the number of customers using its stores over the past few months.
The increase is such in the pledge loan sector that ValueMax, operator of the store in Bendemeer and 15 other shops like this in Singapore, plans to develop not only in neighbouring Malaysia â where it already has four shops â but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, his general director.
The company will fund them using 60% of the $66 million it raised this week when it introduced the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some low-rate lenders have exhausted the criticisms for the exorbitant interest rates they practice, Ms. Yeah indicates that putting in charge not only offers lower rates than other lenders, but also does not directly increase the debt.
"Customers mortgage property that they already own, and monetaryizing their personal property does not increase household debt," she says.
The commitment is increasingly socially accepted as a means of obtaining short-term guaranteed funding.
People who visit on-call lenders are also not only those who have financial problems.
The wealthy people of Singapore also go to the ValueMax pledge loan stores to hold gold ingots or Rolex watches, which can represent up to 60% of their cash purchase price.
We see customers from all layers of society.
"It may be wealthy people who need to borrow in the short term for commercial activities or investments, or small businesses that have cash needs to go through a difficult path," adds Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Pastor accused of juvenile pornography in Nova Scotia
A pastor working with young people in the Halifax region of Nova Scotia is accused of juvenile pornography.
Aaron Hudgins, aged 30, was arrested on Friday morning following searches at his home and at the National Research Council office where he works.
The Baptist church of Timberlay, where the pastor was in office, is deeply saddened by this news.
In a communiquÃ©, church officials indicated that Mr. Hudgins resigned from his post.
The pastor was released under conditions.
In particular, it must not communicate with persons under the age of 18 and not access the Internet.
He will appear in provincial court in Halifax in December.
He goes into Nazi uniform at the supermarket before he gets away from it.
A man dressed in a Nazi uniform barred from a brassard with the gamed cross was asked to leave an English supermarket, customers complaining to the management of the facility that called the police, said the store Friday.
"We received several customer complaints, so we asked him to leave the store," explained a spokesperson for the Asda supermarket chain.
The store called the police to rescue, but "the time she arrived, he had already left without a crash," she added.
I was tailing when I saw a woman who seemed upset.
People were dumb mouths.
"You don't go out like this in the street unless you want to draw attention," testified a client, Rosina Rusin, aged 60, in the Cambridge News newspaper.
This incident occurred on Thursday, the day of the Halloween party, where it is customary to dress up as a monster, but it was difficult to know if it was a canular.
A Cambridge man claimed responsibility for this act on his Twitter account, where he posted images of Adolf Hitler.
"I've been wearing a black SS armband twice a week at Asda's house for three years," said Paul Dutton, explaining "mental problems".
$325 million rescue plan for Tasmania's health system
The federal government maintains that the $325 million rescue plan for the wavering health system has strict conditions to ensure that the Government of the State will not waste funds.
The Federal Minister of Health Tanya Libersek announced that the Commonwealth is currently taking "emergency measures" to put an end to a crisis caused by the aging of the island population, the high rate of chronic diseases and the constraints of the system.
Funding, scheduled for 4 years, was decided after government consultations with the independent Member of Tasmania, Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has proposed an emergency rescue plan that, in our view, will address the unique challenges facing the state," said Ms.Plibersek today.
The $325M plan includes a $31M campaign for non-emergency surgical operations.
2,600 additional operations, including in the field of orthopaedic surgery and cataract, will help catch up.
Funding is also provided for non-rescheduled clinics in Hobart and Launceston, improved external care, training of medical staff, mental health services and deployment of electronic medical records systems in local hospitals.
"These investments respond to the idea that, according to frontline clinicians, this is the best way to treat Tasmania's health system," said Ms.Plibersek.
The Minister stated that the Tasmanian government would face a strict reporting and accountability regime.
The State will need to maintain current levels of funding in order to receive Commonwealth money and prepare monthly reports on areas where it spends additional funds.
A three-person commission will be formed to ensure that the State provides services as efficiently and efficiently as possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that the $325 million will not be large "unless they are followed by a genuine reform to consolidate Tasmania's public health system".
However, he congratulated the government for responding to the urgent request for assistance it submitted to Prime Minister in early May.
"I hope that the federal aid plan will contribute greatly to removing Tasmania's public health system from the blacklist," said Wilkie.
According to the Government of the State, these additional non-emergency procedures will largely reverse recent cuts.
But the spokesperson for the opposition to health Peter Dutton believes today's announcement is "a solution of fortune".
"The reason we're here is that the State Labour Government has withdrawn $430 million from its health system," he said on ABC TV.
We can't have a government of the state that takes out almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth that puts 300 million dollars, and claim it's a bad day.
Mr. Dutton visited Ms. Plibersek to ensure that no dollar of the rescue plan would be spent in additional bureaucracy.
The adaptation by Guillaume Nicloux of Denis Diderot's novel is a remarkable artistic direction and a careful reconstruction of the time, but it is also more laborious than it should be.
In France of the 1760s, she tells the dark story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent to a convent by her family.
When she rebels, she faces the endless cruelty of a deliberately sadistic Higher Mother and becomes an object of erotic fascination for another.
The film never pours into lubrication or sensationalism, and that's the problem.
The conscientious solemnity of the narrative could also become a penalty for the public.
Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons production capacity, says the monitoring body
Syria destroyed the essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition filled with toxic gases, declared the international chemical weapons monitoring agency Thursday, while violent clashes raged in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic agents are supposed to be stored.
A group of Syrian militants also said on Thursday that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the beginning of the civil war in the country nearly three years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came with one day in advance on the deadline of the
1 November established by the Hague-based organization ordering Damascus to destroy or "make useless" all chemical weapons production units and machines intended to mix toxic gases and to fill ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important step in the ambitious timetable for destroying the chemical weapons in Damascus by mid-2014.
With the destruction of equipment, Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus has yet to begin the destruction of existing weapons and reserves.
It is believed that the country has about 1,000 tons of chemicals and products, including mustard gas and sarin neurotoxic agent.
The announcement was made as the fighting raged on Thursday in the city of Safira which, according to experts, houses a chemical weapons production unit as well as storage sites, reported the Syrian Human Rights Observatory based in Great Britain.
The group of activists, which follows the evolution of the human balance through a network of Syrian-based activists, declared on Thursday that 120,296 people were dead.
Among them, 61,067 civilians are estimated, including 6, 365 children.
On the government side, it is estimated that 29,954 members of President Bachar el-Assad's armed forces were killed, of which 18,678 were pro-government forces fighters and 187 of Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
Among the dead, it is also estimated that 2,202 were deserters and some 5 375 of the opposition fighters, many of whom were strangers.
On 25 July, the United Nations estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
She hasn't updated this number since.
Some 2 million people had to flee the country because of the conflict.
Assad's troops have fought against the rebels, many of whom have been linked to Al-Qaeda network groups in Safira for weeks.
The Observatory declared on Thursday that there were losses on both sides, but did not provide any clarification.
The fighting highlighted the importance of the dangers faced by chemical weapons inspectors while completing their mission, namely to rid Syria of its toxic arsenal in the midst of a long-lasting civil war.
A statement by the OPCW, working closely with the United Nations, indicated that its team was "now satisfied with having controlled â and seen destroyed â all declared critical production and machines intended for mixing and filling."
She added that "no other inspection activity was planned for the time being."
Earlier this week, the inspectors stated that they had completed the first stage of the audit work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites reported by Damascus.
They were unable to visit the last two sites due to safety concerns, the inspectors indicated.
On Thursday, OPCW said that the two sites were, according to Syria, "forgotten and...that the elements of the chemical weapons program they contained had been moved to other declared sites, which were inspected."
It was difficult to know at first sight whether the Safira unit was one of the two sites that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria submitted a comprehensive plan for the destruction of its chemical weapons, which was approved by the OPCW Executive Committee the following month.
"I welcome the moral strength and courage that you have all demonstrated in the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization," said the Director General of the organization Ahmet Uzumcu, in a comment published by the OPCW.
Now in its third year, civil war mainly opposes Sunni Muslim rebels to the government of El-Assad and its security forces, which are supported by members of the Alauite sect, a branch of Shiite Islam.
On the other hand, the Director of the Syrian Human Rights Observatory stated that there had been a major explosion on Wednesday in an air defence base in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion remains unknown, did he add.
Anger provoked by the sentence against one of Bali's bombers
Survivors and close to 202 people killed in the Bali attacks in 2002 reacted with anger to the sentence against the last of the conspirators to be brought to justice, saying that Umar Patek should be shot by an execution squad.
Patek, who spent almost 10 years in flight being one of the most wanted men in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to 20 years in prison yesterday for his role in the manufacture of explosive equipment used in the attacks.
He could be released after 15 years under parole.
The 45-year-old man was found guilty of mass killing for the two nightclub attacks in the popular tourist district of Kuta, which caused the death of 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injured many.
He was also found guilty of many other charges in connection with terrorism, including a wave of attacks on churches throughout Indonesia on the eve of Christmas 2000.
Prosecutors have applied for life imprisonment, yet they could have asked that the man, called the "Demolition Man" for his reputation as an expert in the manufacture of bombs, be sentenced to death.
The decision revived painful memories for June Corteen, a mother of Perth who lost her two twins of 39 years old, Jane and Jenny, in the destruction perpetrated by Patek and other conspirators nearly 10 years ago.
On board the tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should have followed the same path as other men.
"He should be dragged before the execution squad," Ms. Corteen told the AAP.
I have to live every day without having other grandchildren or seeing my daughters.
The Sari Club was completely destroyed when a huge bomb, loaded in a van parked outside, exploded just after 23 a.m. on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar when a kamikaze blew a backpack loaded with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
He hid in the coma the day after the attack and remained unconscious for a month, and he was "dead" three times while he was under respiratory assistance.
Mr. Hugues stated that Patek should have known the same fate as the other three members of the Jemaah Islamiyah terrorist cell responsible for the carnage â Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra â which were executed four years ago.
In fact, this man should have been sentenced to death before the others.
Keeping him alive, why, there is no reason to keep him alive.
Spend 20 years in prison after killing 202 people and hurting hundreds of others, that's not much.
Patek is the last of Bali's bombers to be brought to justice.
He had managed to avoid capture for nearly 10 years but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where the American forces will kill the former leader of Al-Qaeda, Ousama ben Laden, less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI officer stated that intelligence reports had revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet Ben Laden with a view to restoring links between terrorist groups in Southeast Asia and Al-Qaeda.
"He didn't leave," said Ms. Corteen.
Until recently, he laughed at how much sorrow he could have caused to others.
The verdict was rendered on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the attacks to be celebrated later this year and marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
"There will be a lot of tears this year," said Ms. Corteen.
Patek, however, may appeal his conviction.
FAA: Air passengers can now use gadgets on board aircraft (but not call with their mobile phone)
Passengers from airlines will be able to use their electronic door-to-door devices to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music â but not talk on their mobile phone â under the new very expected guidelines published by the Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday.
But passengers should not expect immediate changes.
The speed with which the change will be implemented will vary from airline to airline, said FAA administrator Michael Huerta at a press conference.
Air carriers will have to prove to FAA that their aircraft comply with the new guidelines and have updated crew training manuals and equipment storage rules for compliance.
The FAA stated that it had already received plans from certain airlines to expand the use of electronic devices on their aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are part of companies that have already submitted plans.
"According to the plan, we could approve an expanded use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers must turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft doors are closed.
They are not supposed to light them up before the plane reaches an altitude of 10,000 feet and the commander gives his green fire.
Passengers are supposed to turn off their aircraft when the plane goes down before the landing and do not light them up until the plane has set.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference will be able to allow passengers to use their aircraft during take-offs, landings and ground bearings, the FAA said.
Most new line planes and other aircraft that have been modified so that passengers can use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, said she was happy about these changes.
âOnce the new policy is implemented safely â and we will work closely with the carriers for this â it will be beneficial for everyone,â Glading explained in a statement.
We are frankly tired of feeling like "room overseers" when it comes to this issue.
But it will always be forbidden to connect to the Internet to surf, exchange emails and SMS or download data below 10,000 feet, said the agency.
Passengers will have to put their smartphones, tablets and other devices in aircraft mode.
So still no Words With Friends, the Scrabble-style online game the actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he was expelled loudly from an American Airlines plane after refusing to turn off his device while the aircraft was parked at the door.
And the heavier devices like laptops will always have to be stored because they could hurt someone if they flew through the cabin.
On-board mobile phones will also continue to be prohibited.
The regulatory authority for mobile phones belongs to the Federal Communications Commission and not to the FAA.
FAA can lift the ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national transport safety expert on CBS News, said that mobile phones were always considered to be at risk.
"Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they could possibly create interference with navigational instruments, but because we know, according to the FCC, that they could disrupt mobile telephone antennas if they are used on board," Rosenker said.
An industrial advisory committee established by the FAA to consider the problem recommended last month that the government authorize wider use of personal electronic devices.
The pressure on the FAA has increased in recent years to ease restrictions on their use.
Detractors such as Senator Claire McCaskill, D-Mo, argue that there is no valid security reason for these prohibitions.
Restrictions are also increasingly difficult to apply as the use of devices has become ubiquitous.
Some studies indicate that at least one third of passengers forget to turn off their devices, or deliberately do so.
The FAA began to limit the use of electronic devices in 1996 following reports on interference with navigation and communication instruments when passengers transported FM radios, the high-tech gadget at that time.
New line aircraft depend much more on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed to withstand electronic interference and approved by the FAA.
The airlines allow their passengers to use Wi-Fi at cruise altitudes for several years.
The modified aircraft to host Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of line aircraft should allow wider use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, said Huerta.
Today's electronic devices generally emit radio transmissions of power much lower than previous generations of devices.
E-book readers, for example, only issue minimal transmissions when turning a page.
But transmissions are stronger when devices download or send data.
Amazon.com is one of those who pressure to ease restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers.
In 2011, company leaders commissioned a Kindle e-book liner plane and flew it to see if there were any problems, but there was none.
This inspired the members of the FAA Advisory Committee to express mixed feelings about whether or not the use of devices presents a risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airlines Passengers stated that he thought interference from devices was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other committee members stated that there are only anecdotal reports from pilots that indicate that aircraft can interfere with aircraft systems, and that most of them are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that FAA allow pilots to request passengers to turn off their devices during landings on instruments in low visibility.
A group of the travel industry welcomed the changes, calling them sensible arrangements for travellers equipped with technology.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not incompatible with security," said Roger Dow, President and Director of the U.S. Travel Association.
A helitreuized bird of a North Sea platform has been released into nature
A bird, helitreuized after being found exhausted on an oil platform in the North Sea, was released into nature.
The water stream was mounted on board a helicopter towards Aberdeen last month before it was set up by the Scottish SPCA in its Alloa rescue center.
The director of the centre, Colin Seddon, said: "This stream of water was probably a wintering migrant who came from northern Europe and found himself caught in the midst of violent winds in the North Sea."
It appears that the exhausted bird would have managed to find refuge on the oil platform.
He added: "He was unable to fly again, so we were contacted to help us."
The water stream was healthy when it was released.
Is the European elite ready to do business with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise of bringing companies together and defining what the creators of wealth and jobs want to see change in our relationship with the EU.
To do so, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders and asked them what they thought of Britain, businesses and the EU.
YouGov has interviewed more than 1,000 business leaders, representing all sizes of companies, sectors and regions of Great Britain.
The findings of the investigation will be a surprise to many.
We have discovered that the vast majority of companies are now trying to export outside Europe, focusing on the countries that are modernizing and developing while the EU states are stagnant.
They want to see the government give priority to new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil rather than get involved in the long and arduous process of reforming European institutional arcanes.
When asked for their advice on specific policy points â ranging from the regulation of monopolies to product laws â the majority of heads of business believe that control of these key skills should return to Westminster.
The single market has caused general discontent, with companies saying that the cost of the Brussels Regulation is disproportionate to the benefits of the European trade area â 40% of large, traditionally most pro-European, companies agree.
Finally, and what is more, our survey of business leaders has revealed that a large majority wanted Britain to continue efforts to change the Treaty and develop a trade-based relationship with the EU, not politics.
This conclusion, which is found in all major groups and companies of all sizes, shows that the company's world insists on a "significant change" that brings power back to the UK.
The issues are high â succeeding in changing the Treaty and better representing the interests of Britain would allow for a 16% shift in votes for the EU's maintenance during a referendum.
The Prime Minister should not doubt for a moment: this investigation shows that British companies support this plan to renegotiate the terms of Britain's accession to the EU.
It also shows that companies hope that renegotiation will constitute a significant change in the current balance of power in favour of a return to the hands of the United Kingdom.
It is possible, and increasingly necessary, to better represent the interests of British companies, as the euro area is committed to closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be employment and growth in Britain and, as the conclusions of our survey show, for businesses this means once again putting emphasis on trade and a fundamental change in the regulatory approach in Brussels.
The United States to the colors of Halloween
In the United States, President Obama did not derogate from the Halloween tradition.
With his wife, last night, he distributed friandies to hundreds of children invited to the gardens of the White House in Washington.
Last year, the Halloween festivities on the east coast of the United States had been cancelled due to the passage of Hurricane Sandy.
This year, therefore, the parties were caught up.
In New York, thousands of costumed people participated in the parade organized in the "Greenwich village" neighborhood.
Everyone is overexcited, tells one of the participants, Andrea.
I was finally able to put on the costume I had planned for last year.
We're having fun like crazy, adds Rhonda.
People are happy.
He's a good kid, he's cool.
We really need this.
Halloween is a pagan festival celebrated on the eve of Toussaint, mainly in the Anglo-Saxon countries.
Alexei Miller de Gazprom states that Bulgaria's pipeline opens a new era of gas
The start of the construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe's largest energy projects, said the Director of Gazprom.
"A historic event took place today: Construction started in the Bulgarian part of the South Stream pipeline, Europe's largest large-scale project," explained Alexei Miller, CEO of Gazprom, in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of energy security throughout the European continent.
South Stream is expected to diversify Russia's export routes to Europe.
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and his Ukrainian counterpart, through which most of the Russian gas is transiting to Europe, increases the level of risk compared to conventional routes, adds the Director.
Miller added that the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are "forever".
Bulgarian consumers will receive South Stream gas at a reduced rate as soon as the whole project is put into operation in 2015.
Gazprom indicated that construction should start in other countries downstream by the end of the year.
The pipeline was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubic metres of natural gas.
Pitcairn wants to create the world's largest marine reserve
The island of Pitcairn wants to create the world's largest marine reserve, announced on Thursday the daily Les Nouvelles de Tahiti, taking in information from Radio Australia.
This island, east of the Gambier Archipelago (French Polynesia), is the last British territory of the South Pacific, halfway between New Zealand and Chile.
This territory measures 47 km2, if there are three other small islands nearby.
He has been British since his occupation in 1790 by the Bounty mutinies, an episode of the history of the English Navy that took place in three Hollywood adaptations.
A few tens of inhabitants, mostly descendants of Bounty mutinies, still live in Pitcairn, and their incomes depend on the generosity of London.
The Council of the Island voted unanimously for the creation of a marine reserve around the small archipelago, which corresponds to its exclusive economic zone.
A deputy mayor of the island went to London to ask Britain to validate this application.
Mike Warren, Mayor of Pitcairn, believes that the creation of such a protected area would be a first step towards more financial autonomy for his island.
The project must be accepted by the English Governor of Pitcairn, residing in New Zealand, and by the British Government.
The establishment of such a marine reserve would allow the United Kingdom to sanctuate these 836,000 km2, however, provided it has the means to monitor it, which is not the case.
There is no airport in Pitcairn, which makes it impossible to base one or more aircraft dedicated to surveillance of the area, and there is no port to place military surveillance vessels.
As for France, it must already carry out the very costly air and sea surveillance of the five million km2 of the French Polynesian EEZ, next to Pitcairn.

Life imprisonment for an ex-Chinese deputy governor
A former deputy governor of Jilin Province in northeastern China was sentenced to life imprisonment for corruption on Friday.
Excluding the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was accused of having touched more than 19 million yuan of wine pots, reporting the official Chinese media.
Between 1995 and 2001, the Deputy Governor, who was also the President of the Bank of Jilin, a public institution, helped companies and managers to obtain contracts, loans or promotions in exchange for money or gifts, declared Beijing's first intermediate court on its microblog.
President Xi Jinping, who took office last March, made the fight against corruption a national priority, believing that the phenomenon posed a threat to the existence of the Communist Party itself.
If the head of state promised that justice would be as intractable with the powerful "tigres" as with the "mouches" - subordinate officials - only a handful of senior officials have been convicted, including former Petrochina oil giant executives.
The most recent case was that of the former head of the CCP in Chongqing, Bo Xilai, who was sentenced to life in September for corruption and abuse of power after targeting the highest functions in the state.
However, the government has not shown any intention of reforming the anti-corruption system by creating, for example, an independent party body.
Two YMCA employees accused of sexual assault following allegations made against Jonathan Lord at a hearing of the Royal Commission.
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales were accused of sexual assault against children following allegations made against the educator of Caringbah, Jonathan Lord, in 2011, at a hearing of the Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse of Children.
But in its opening statement to the Commission, YMCA stated that "he had never had to deal with a problem of sexual assault on children within his organization."
Director General Phillip Hare was questioned about two cases: an employee of the YMCA was charged with child pornography offences and a physical education monitor of the YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of sexual assault on children in the centre where he worked in 1991.
Mr.Hare told Gail Furness, counsel to the Commission, that he had heard of the first case but was not aware of the second case.
He also admitted that the YMCA opening statement was inaccurate by stressing, "external controls of the YMCA were carried out and indicated that child safety was an absolute priority for the organization."
It was demonstrated to the Commission that the YMCA had been informed that it had received the second worst assessment of four institutions during a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities in August of this year.
Mr. Hare, who started working at the YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that staff management was a failure with Lord's recruitment and had failed to verify that employees knew that they were required to report any violations of child security policy.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual assault on twelve boys during the two years he worked at the YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum sentence of 6 years in prison.
But Mr.Hare rejected the idea that the YMCA would have a cultural problem preventing staff from reporting Lord's shortcomings in child safety.
The staff testified that they had observed certain faults, including the fact that Lord remained alone with the children, who kept them in private, had them sit on his knees, told them he loved them, and let them play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was led by Lord and had applied for child protection training because she was concerned about her behaviour, said that she found herself responsible for child services at YMCA Caringbah, Jacqui Barnat, who would frame Lord "very intimidating and difficult to approach most of the time."
The Director General said that he rejected the testimony of staff that they were reluctant to report these breaches to their superior.
Instead, he stated that the friendly relations they had with Lord have blurred their judgment, which is why they did not report his actions.
Mr.Hare stated that he had expressed his views before the Council of New South Wales YMCA saying that for the organization, the lesson learned from the "Jonathan Lord incident" should not concern "reporting" by staff, and the Council agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to sign confidentiality agreements to the staff was taken by the YMCA Director General for Child Services, Liam Whitley shortly after the allegations were raised.
He stated that this decision was intended to avoid any contamination of evidence but that it was an "excess of zeal" and that it had been misimplemented.
The New South Wales YMCA was not a safe organization for children at the time Jonathan Lord was employed, namely between 2009 and 2011, said the expert on sexual violence against children, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University to the Commission.
He indicated that there were "serious problems" in recruitment, control, initiation, training and supervision of staff.
The hearing was adjourned until December 20.
Tony Blair said he would seize the opportunity to become Prime Minister again, but recognizes that his return is unlikely.
In an interview last night marking the fifth anniversary of his departure at the end of his term, the 59-year-old man expressed his opinion on various national policies.
Since his departure in June 2007, after a decade at the head of the country, Mr. Blair has largely avoided discussing British policy, limiting his comments on foreign affairs and his special role as envoy of the Quartet for the Middle East peace process.
When asked if he would like to return to the position of Prime Minister, Mr. Blair would have responded, according to the London Evening Standard: "Yes, of course, but it may happen, so..."
When many experts in equestrian events met in Cardiff to face and win the Horse of the year, they knew that the competition would be rough.
But no one expected to win Fenton Kirkland, a three-year-old.
Not yet in school and only a few months after making his first weapons, the all-little girl and her Shetland Toffee pony trotted during the three laps with great ease and won the first prize, leaving behind the other 30 adult competitors.
The two inseparable â which are of the same size â were praised for the presentation, attitude and style during the annual competition held at the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
Presented against men and women in elegant melon hats, he wore his flat cap a little on the side casually to parade his 2-year-old Toffee pony around the track.
Fenton was hailed by judges for its unusual natural qualities of dressing for a child of his or her age.
And Toffee received very good notes for her presentation and personality.
Fenton had Toffee as a gift for his 3rd anniversary last March and has trained since with his Shetland pony every day.
His 30-year-old mother Donna said, "Fenton and Toffee make an excellent duo."
They presented themselves to and against all, but the two spread the golden cup and the rosette.
It was only the second time that he was competing with Toffee and we were mad at the joy he won.
On the track, people who didn't know him thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to get photographed with him.
This young boy, from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, in the south of Wales, follows the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been participating in equestrian competitions for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howells said, "There was electricity in the air and everyone was encouraging and applauding him."
He walked the entire length of the running track and even though it seemed to be very small, he did a wonderful job.
Fenton is crazy about animals â he loves horses, tractors and the rural world and has two chickens he takes care of.
As he began, he will surely soon participate in the year's Horse event â and I'm sure he will make a good performance.
A spokesperson for the annual equestrian demonstration said: "Fenton is only 3 years old but he knows how to drive his pony."
They're a good team.
The judges noticed that Fenton and Toffee presented well and the way they paraded on the track.
They are looking for an effective teamwork between the pony and the trainer â Fenton and Toffee were the best on the track.
I'm sure his beautiful clothes helped Fenton, he was really proud.
A Chinese newspaper that launched a call "will be remodeled"
A Chinese newspaper that launched a front page call for the release of a journalist accused of defamation will be remanded, states a press regulator.
The Guangzhou-based New Express issued a rare public appeal for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen subsequently admitted to television that he had accepted wine pots to manufacture stories about a semi-public society.
Now, the New Express is going to undergo a "complete remodeling," said the regulator.
The order of "renewal" emanates from Guangdon's administration for Press and Edition, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express, belonging to the Yangcheng Evening News group, had published several erroneous articles on the company listed Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
"New Express was disorganized," the regulator said in a statement.
He said he had decided "to impose administrative sanctions on Chen Yongzhou by withdrawing his press card."
He also "ordered the Yangcheng Evening News group to undertake a complete New Express remodeling, and recommended that he conduct an investigation into the people responsible at New Express and immediately remand the newspaper's management team."
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express on the alleged financial irregularities of a manufacturer of construction equipment called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his newspaper twice issued a first page call for his release, writing that he supported his journalism.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on a public television channel where he admitted to publishing false stories against money.
"In this case, I have harmed Zoomlion and the media industry and its ability to gain public confidence," he said to the CCTV public television network.
I did it mainly because I was running after money and fame.
I realized my mistake.
Following Mr. Chen's apology, New Express published his excuses on the front page, writing that he had failed to properly verify his articles.
Several important suspects have recently made televised confessions.
Experts say that people are systematically forced to confess, despite a change in the law that was voted earlier in the year prohibiting authorities from forcing anyone to commit themselves.
The Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier in "unavailable"
In Toulon, the aircraft carrier is in a hurry.
The leak of radioactive vapour detected on one of Charles de Gaulle's two nuclear boilers in mid-October and while the ship was at sea, was "no danger to the sailors", but it is not without consequence for the Navy.
The Royale has indeed confirmed to us the "unavailable" of the ship until "the mid-November", "the time to take the corrective measures necessary" on the reactor.
For its part, the company DCNS, a naval defence specialist, ensures that its teams and those of Areva, dispatched to Var for the occasion, "currently intervene on the aircraft carrier".
It is for them, among other things, to change a pump on the fail-safe.
"Everything is implemented so that Charles de Gaulle can carry out its planned deployment at the end of 2013," explains DCNS.
And the National Navy certifies that "it does not at all question the ship's programme of activity" to nuclear propulsion.
Let us remember that the Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier comes out of an intermediate six-month maintenance period.
He had fitted Toulon in mid-October for training.
This is particularly so in order to qualify young hunting pilots.
A "little damage", confined to the space of containment of the reactor, had then occurred on the admiral ship of the French fleet.
According to the National Navy, the crew had not been exposed to possible radioactive contamination.
For more than a year, everywhere, I have been able to see a great deal of discontent on the part of the people I meet: monstrous reassessment of their properties, tax flooding, the cost of permits of all kinds, administrative costs not to end.
In short, unlimited siphoning of our pockets.
Millions of dilapidated dollars could be spared in order to allow a very respectful taxation of those who pay.
Any money taken from force to taxpayers reduces their freedom of consumption and contributes to their depletion.
In Shawinigan, despite the closure of all major companies, there is no problem with the sumptuous expenditure and maintenance of boisterous ducks: deficit cultural centre, strong subsidy to the City of Energy, etc.
If these facilities are not profitable, they will be sold to or demolished by the private company.
It is also important to note the expropriation of several properties in order to accommodate a major industry that has never come.
However, I give an honourable mention to the transformation of the former Wabasso into a kind of industrial incubator, but at what cost for tax payers?
It is not at the public level to invest in such enterprises, but also in the private sector based on consumer demand.
Citizens were happy to learn that the lakes at the Fisheries and Pillars will continue to supply the city with drinking water.
As a result of the departure of all industries (large water users) and the great decline in the population, water use has significantly decreased throughout the territory.
Not to mention waste, the city will never lack water and the strict regulation of its use could be greatly softened.
In short, it is very easy to achieve great things with the money of others.
I'd be ashamed to defend such a balance sheet.
With a gross debt of over $200 million, this city is no longer able to buy a pen without going through a loan settlement.
We've been managed for over 40 years by ties with beautiful degrees for most of us and I don't think a sheep raiser makes it worse.
Discovery of a drug tunnel between the United States and Mexico with its own railway
One of the most sophisticated tunnels used for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico, with its own lighting, ventilation and electrical rail systems, was discovered.
The U.S. authorities described the tunnel of 4 feet per 3 as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they've ever seen.
The tunnel, zigzag over a length equivalent to nearly six long football grounds, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, San Diego, United States.
The area is full of indefinable warehouses, allowing easy concealment of drug trucks.
The tunnel was closed before the drugs emerged by passing unnoticed, said the authorities.
The authorities seized 8.5 tons of marijuana and 148 kg of cocaine after the discovery of the tunnel, according to judicial records.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers were accused of possession of marijuana and cocaine with intent to sell.
They are sentenced to life imprisonment for 10 years if they are sentenced.
In Nogales, Arizona, traffickers operate large underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels have been discovered as a result of the marijuana harvest in central Mexico in October, which poses a challenge for drug cartels that must quickly deliver their products to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a passage of about 700 yards equipped with railways that went from the kitchen of a house in Tijuana and went up to two warehouses in San Diego.
British police issue extradition warrant against Assange
The British police today issued an extradition warrant against the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange, who took refuge at the Embassy of Ecuador in London and requested political asylum.
Scotland Yard stated that she had issued a "remission notice" against the 40-year-old Australian, asking him to appear at a police station, adding that if he did not, he would be able to be arrested.
Assange could be extradited to Sweden as a result of allegations of sexual crime, having exhausted all possible avenues under British law after the Supreme Court invalidated his appeal against his extradition at the beginning of the month.
Fearing that Stockholm would authorize its transfer to the United States, he found refuge at the Embassy of Ecuador in London on 19 June, asking that country of South America the political asylum.
Scotland Yard "issued a notice of surrender against a 40-year-old man who asked him to report to a police station on the date and time of his choice," said a spokesperson.
He continues to violate the conditions of his release on bail.
The Embassy refused to comment on the issuance of the opinion by the police.
Assange feared that he would be extradited from Sweden to the United States where he might be accused of espionage, after having unveiled more than 250,000 American diplomatic cables on WikiLeaks website fighting against secret information.
How biometry will invade our lives
Finish the password to tap to access your smartphone or pay for your purchases?
American, French or Japanese researchers predict a future where we will be recognized by biometric sensors of phones and computers.
Bernard Didier, Deputy Director General of Morpho , even believes that "the century will be biometric".
Only biometry will ensure the identity of a person performing transactions in a universe as transverse and transnational as well as the Internet .
Organizations dedicated to privacy confirm this concern for biometry, but worry about it.
Only in 2011 and in France, the National Commission on Informatics and Freedoms has authorized 774 systems for the recognition of fingerprints, the form of the hand or the venous network of the hand in companies, administrations, canteens...
"Everyone will soon be able to be identified, anywhere and anytime," said Justin Brookman, responsible for consumer privacy within the CDT (Center for Democracy and Technology) in Washington.
The reasons for such optimism, in some, and pessimism, in others?
Biometry will rely on new technologies, which will provide new services to citizens and consumers.
Today, in France, the most widely used biometric data are the fingerprints, the contour of the hand and the venous network of the palm or fingers.
But each of these techniques has its own constraints.
"For example, some people who work on concrete have very damaged fingers and their fingerprints are unreadable," says Philippe Robin, technical director of the identity field at Thales Communications & Security.
And the collection as well as the verification of the venous network and the contour of the hand imply a voluntary and precise gesture of people.
It is both a security - we cannot capture this data on their own - and a disadvantage: the procedure must sometimes be repeated and therefore take time.
Consequently, research has been conducted for some twenty years on other approaches, such as facial or iris recognition (the colored part of the eye).
Thanks to the increased accuracy of sensors and the computing capacity of computers necessary for data analysis, these techniques become operational.
The precision of facial recognition has been multiplied by ten over the last five years, calculates Cyrille Bataller, director of Accenture R&D laboratories in Europe.
With our help, the United Kingdom and Holland deployed automatic border crossings using facial recognition.
It is now possible to identify a moving face or iris.
"Today we are conducting research on voice recognition or how to walk with sound sensors, but we need a quiet environment," says Sridhar Iyengar, Director of Security Research at Intel Labs.
Unique and unfathomable marker, DNA also arouses hopes and concerns.
"In the current state of knowledge, it can be considered as the ultimate biometric data," confirms Sophie Vomit-Tavernier, Director of Studies, Innovation and Prospective at CNIL.
But DNA analysis is still very long and very expensive.
NEC offers judicial police services a suitcase costing 90,000 euros to analyze DNA samples at the scene of a crime and within an hour.
Uses of biometry are divided into two groups: identification (recognition of one person among others) and authentication (ensure that the person is the one it claims to be).
To date, identification was related to the issue of identity papers: biometric elements (prints, photos, iris) must be compared with the information the State has on all citizens already fixed.
This ensures that one person does not try to usurp someone else's identity.
This principle of comparison may have other applications.
NEC thus offers VIP recognition at the entrance of a hotel or store.
"We collect images of surveillance cameras and compare them to photos of celebrities that circulate freely on the Internet," explains Dany Nassif, responsible for commercial development for biometric identification solutions at NEC France.
Other use: take a picture of a quidam who queues in a store, follow its progress through facial recognition and calculate the waiting time.
The authentication initially concerned physical access (boundary, protected premises, canteens, etc.) or logical (opening a computer).
More recently, the presence control has been added.
"A biometric pointer avoids the phenomenon of the friend who points to another," explains Cyrille Bataller, of Accenture.
But more and more authentication will also concern transactions, in particular those made from devices connected to the Internet.
In Japan, it is already possible to withdraw money from some distributors by entering its card and placing its hand on a biometric reader: this gesture replaces the hit of the secret code.
A similar technique is tested in Villeneuve-d'Ascq and AngoulÃªme by the Natural Security company in partnership with banks and large distribution signs: when paying in store with his bank card, the customer does not tap his code, but introduces his finger into a reader who scans the veins.
The experiment is scheduled to last six months.
If it is conclusive, biometric readers could soon arrive at French traders.
Hints to reassure users
There are three ways to make biometric attractive to the general public.
The first is to explain that she can make time.
"If, thanks to biometry, a customer remains in caisse thirty seconds less, it is valuable," explains the director of a large area.
The second is to offer personalized services: in a few years, a voice server will be able to recognize your voice and offer you custom options.
And finally, reassure yourself by highlighting the precautions taken to protect the databases.
"Digital fingerprints are stored on a first server; people's identities are on a second basis: the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure case, which is blocked if you try to move it," says Philippe Robin of Thales.
But, in the absence of in-depth studies, it is impossible to know whether these speeches really convince users.
The privacy specialists, they, continue to be concerned.
"The progress of facial recognition, the multiplication of surveillance cameras and the huge amount of photos available on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa make me fear the worst: widespread surveillance," predicted Andrew Patrick, of the Office of the Privacy Commissioner in Canada.
A driver driving at 210 km/h with a hot drink between the legs was charged with a ammo of Â£1,000
A car driver was charged a fine of Â£1,000 for riding at 210 km/h with a hot drink balanced between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree in Essex, was spotted driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 to Braintree on May 27.
When the police arrested him, they discovered the drink to take between his legs.
At Colchester's Court of First Instance, Howie admitted the offence of conduct without the necessary caution and attention.
The seven points removed from his permit led to a six-month withdrawal of a licence.
Howie was also sentenced to pay Â£90 and a surcharge for a victim of Â£100.
A tax on foreign real estate owners to blow up the London bubble
The Treasury has provisionally calculated the capital gains tax measure but awaits a final decision by Mr. Osborne, who, in the 2012 budget, has entered a 7% stamp fee for properties that cost more than Â£2 million and annual fees for buyers who choose to own property within a corporation rather than individually.
The stamp right already applies to residential properties of the districts of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, representing Â£708 million over the fiscal year 2012/13, which exceeds the total amount of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, North East, Northwest and Yorkshire and Humber combined.
Mr. Cook stated: "As a result of the increase in the stamp right on high-value properties and the introduction of the anti-avoidance law on the subject, it is very difficult to advance that high-value properties are under-taxed regardless of the effects of the obsolete housing tax system."
"But this change could make foreign investors reluctant to buy properties in London or current owners reluctant to sell," he added.
The prestigious real estate â the 5-10% of the highest prices in the real estate market â in the prosperous sector in south-western London from Fulham to Wimbledon increased by 11.8% over the past year.
Prices in central London show regular year growth of 5.6% but have been overshadowed by a growing "internal market", the south-west of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) with a recovery, according to Savills' studies.
Scientists have just highlighted the way in which the tail movements of a dog are related to their mood.
Previous studies revealed that happy dogs moved more their tail to the right (from the dog's point of view), while nerve dogs moved more to the left.
But now scientists say that dogs can detect and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trent, said: "Everyone knows that in man, the left side and the right side of the brain are involved differently in stimuli that arouse positive or negative emotions."
Here, we tried to see what it was like in other species.
He added that the right side of the brain was responsible for the movement towards the left and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played a different role in the emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to the disorderly tail movements of other dogs, researchers followed animals watching movies where other dogs appeared.
They measured the heart rate of the animals and analyzed their behavior.
It will probably not take long before we understand why their tails sometimes go on one side and sometimes on the other.
Professor Vallortigara explained: "We presented to dogs movies where other dogs appeared â either a naturalist version or a silhouette to avoid any other factor of confusion â and we were able to smuggle the tail movement and present it as going left or right."
When the animals saw a dog without expression rowing the tail to the right (from the point of view of the dog that removes the tail), they remained perfectly relaxed.
But when they spotted a tail drifting mainly to the left (once again from the point of view of the dog that removes the tail), their heart rate accelerated and they looked anxious.
Professor Vallortigara said he did not think that dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these movements.
Rather, he believes that dogs know from experience the movements they should or should not worry about.
He added: "If you meet with other dogs several times and if you notice that, most of the time, the movement of their tails to one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and that the right side leads to a less friendly attitude, you will react according to this experience."
Researchers indicate that results could enable owners, veterinarians and builders to better understand the emotions of their animals.
The canine behavior expert John Bradshaw, an invited professor at the University of Bristol School of Veterinary Sciences, said it was not the first study to examine the importance of left and right in the canine species.
Last year, a team from Lincoln University discovered that dogs turned their heads left when they looked at an aggressive dog and right when it was a happy dog.
And in another scientific study carried out by Victoria University in Canada, he said: "The dogs went more easily to a robot dog when his tail moved to the left rather than to the right, instead of becoming anxious â the opposite of what was in the Italian study."
He said that the differences could come from the fact that dogs that participated in the various studies did not fully consider animals of movies or robots dogs as dogs.
A study on how dogs react to real dogs could be useful, he explained.
"Although many elements, found in different mammals, indicate that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be specified â and dogs are no exception," he said.
However, given the ease with which their behaviors can be recorded, it will probably not take long before we understand why their tails sometimes move on one side and sometimes on the other.
Arctic Monkeys reports a concert in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's disease
The Arctic Monkeys rock group postponed a concert to Glasgow after a laryngitis was diagnosed to its singer.
The Sheffield group was scheduled to take place on Friday in the concert hall of The Hydro in the city centre.
However, his laryngite forced singer Alex Turner to reprogram the show.
The announcement was made after the group was forced to postpone a concert at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys stated: "As a result of the decision to postpone the concert to the Birmingham LG Arena tonight and after requesting medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys must also postpone the show to the Glasgow Hydro on Friday, November 1.
"Alex Turner suffers from a laryngitis and regrets not being able to happen in concert."
The performance at the Birmingham LG Arena will take place on 20 November and the Hydro of Glasgow will take place on 21 November.
All tickets remain valid for these concerts.
We wish to apologize to all ticket holders for any inconvenience caused.

Pope Francis will appoint his first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on 22 February, announced the Vatican Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest churchmen in the Catholic Church behind the pope, and those who choose him, so Francis will appoint his first group of men who will ultimately choose his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, as soon as a cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of a pope â it is therefore a group of 120 elected cardinals.
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for the Vatican, said that a meeting gathering all existing cardinals would be held before the ceremony during which bishops would be raised to the dignity of cardinal, known as consistory.
"Father FranÃ§ois decided to communicate his decision to convene the February consistory in advance to facilitate the planning of other meetings requiring the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero des Voix Catholics stated that by February, the number of electorate cardinals will probably decrease.
He stated that a pope generally named as many cardinals as he needed for the number of elective cardinals to reach 120 and as many cardinals over 80 years of age as he wanted.
Next year's consistory will be important because it will be the first since the election of Pope Francis in March this year, Valero said.
At the moment, there is a tendency to give priority to Europe and in particular to Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he added.
40% of Roman Catholics live in South America, but a small number of cardinals represent them.
Cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since Francis formed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world to examine ways of reforming the church.
Previously, the Pope had decided on his own.
"Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," Valero explained.
He added that it was "everything possible" that Francis asked for counsel from the cardinals.
But we have never experienced such a situation â it is totally new.
Valero said that the popes generally raised bishops representing vast communities to the rank of cardinal, but that Francis was "full of surprises â so we do not know who he will appoint".
GM recalls some of its new pickups in the United States to repair the seat file
General Motors Co recalls nearly 19,000 of its new pickups Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra 2014 to solve a problem with manually tiltable files, according to a statement Friday by the U.S. vehicle safety regulator.
On some pickups, the front seats could present a defect at the inclination mechanism level.
Consequently, files do not comply with federal vehicle safety standards for head restraints.
"If the vehicle is hit by the rear, the head restraint may not properly protect passengers, thereby increasing the risk of injury," according to the statement posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website.
The recalled models were built between 1 August and 10 September.
The deployment of GM pickups began in June and represents the launch of the most important vehicles for the first American car manufacturer since its bankruptcy and restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the pickup owners of the defect during the first 15th of October.
NHTSA was unable to review the letter of information to the owners due to the 16-day cessation of government activities, which slowed the growth of vehicle sales in October.
The sales of pickups Silverado and Sierra, which were redesigned for the 2014 model, increased by approximately 20% during the first 10 months of the year, said GM Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 pickups Silverado and 16,503 pickups Sierra.
GM's share rate increased by 1.4 per cent to $37.47 at the New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon.
A worker dies buried under concrete blocks
A construction worker died buried under dozens of concrete blocks, Thursday afternoon, in Montreal.
The drama occurred about 11 a.m. on Marquette Street, near the intersection of Beaubien Street, in the roundabout of Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie.
According to all likelihood, work on the foundations had been carried out in this place for some time.
A mitoy foundation wall had just been erected in the last few days.
The accident occurred when the victim had just arrived on the site to recover his tools.
I drove by and saw the wall collapse with a big smoke cloud, Sylvain Jean said, who lives near the yard.
I landed and went to remove the big bricks that covered him.
We only saw a part of his back, it's so unhappy.
According to the authorities, the victim is an elderly man in the 50 who worked for a co-fragage company.
Resuscitation maneuvers were attempted by emergency services, but were unsuccessful.
Man has not survived his grave injuries.
An inspector of the Labour Safety and Health Commission was dispatched to the scene to investigate the circumstances surrounding this drama.
The Shout of Despair by an elector of Obama
I voted twice for President Obama, believing in the possibility of a change
He says that Obama has made commendable efforts by the Republican Party's obstructionism
Obstructionism does not excuse the difficulties of the Obamacare site, nor the drone attacks
Obama's 2008 campaign memory is a sad reminder of what might have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second year medical student at Harvard Medical School.
I'm reading a very sad book these days.
It's a book that, I thought, would encourage me during the delay of the second year of medicine and give me hope.
It's called "The Audacity to Win" and it's the memoirs of the 2008 Barack Obama presidential campaign.
When I finished my patients' medical records in the evening and I fell asleep, this book brings me back to the time when policies inspired millions of people and where speeches could cut your breath.
The election ended with an overwhelming victory and the presenters of news newspapers took the time to reflect on the historical nature of the time.
My friends cried with joy and my parents kept all the newspapers they found.
A young team of visionaries advanced towards the White House and the nation was ready for change.
During the transition period of Obama prior to his take-up in 2008, he had 82% positive views.
And then I close the book.
Returning to the present is a difficult awakening, it's like coming out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these days full of optimism, they are like distant memories, a sad reminder of the opportunities of the past.
The change really happened in the years that followed the first time I voted.
It had nothing to do with what I had imagined.
I credit Obama with great achievements, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act (Affordable Care Act) to the departure of Iraq from our army, through the end of the "not seen nor known" and the assassination of Ousama ben Laden.
In addition, I believe that partisan obstructionism has destroyed too many efforts to advance our nation in the area of immigration reforms, public health care and the closure of Guantanamo, among other things.
But after having repeatedly defended Obama's administration against my peers and colleagues, I can no longer provide explanations.
I am on the brink of political despair.
The Republican obstruction cannot explain the listening of foreign leaders, nor the attacks of drone-innocent foreign children.
It cannot explain that the National Security Agency collects data on the privacy of Americans, nor can the indictments of whistleblowers who reveal the government's misdemeanors.
It cannot justify the assassination of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without trial, nor the evasion of public funding and the overexpenditure allowed during the presidential campaigns.
It cannot justify the conclusions of a report that says that the White House's efforts to reduce the media silence are "the most aggressive... since the administration of Nixon".
And, more recently, it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website for more than three years after the Act on the Affordable Care Act has been ratified.
I don't know if that's what I expected.
If, at 18, I was supposed to understand that governance could contradict the political campaigns that precede it.
Of course, the electoral function is not predictable because the opposition political party and the events that happen by chance, such as the Newton massacre, influence our public conversation.
However, all of the examples I have listed above seem to be largely the choice of administration.
That's what bothers me the most.
I voted again for Obama in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confused and poorly refined alternative that did not seem to enable him to determine his policies or positions.
I felt that Obama, elected for a second term by being freed from the pressure of future elections, would keep the promises we had been hearing for so long.
However, while the favourable opinion index has plunged below 45% this week, it is even more difficult to return to 2008 through this book.
It makes me want the many promises that have flown.
This week, I read the part of the book that describes how Obama suffered enormous losses to Clinton's Pennsylvania Mayors.
At a post-campaign meeting, he told his team that they had to get back on track and remain faithful to their cause.
"I want us to focus on our talent," he said.
We must remember who we are.
Here we are 5 years later, Mr President, and I no longer agree with you.
The views expressed in this comment are only those of Nathaniel Morris.
Friday, about 3 p.m., a violent collision between a motorcycle and a car occurred on Retinne Street in FlÃ©ron.
Jonathan, aged 26, from FlÃ©ron, did not wear a helmet.
Despite the rapid intervention of relief, he died during this frontal collision.
Clive Palmer claims that MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system.
Billionaire Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system because his daughters could be pregnant and benefit from this system.
The mining magnate, which contests the payment of a carbon tax of $6 million, argued this argument in order to try to dismiss issues related to a potential conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial when deciding whether carbon and mining taxes should be abolished.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and indicated that Mr. Abbott's daughters were ready to benefit personally from these policies.
"It will have a major conflict of interest when it comes to paying parental leave because if one of her daughters is pregnant, she will have a direct interest in whether she gets a leave," said Palmer.
Two months after his election, the Electoral Commission officially declared that Mr. Palmer had won the seat of Sunshine Coast of Fairfax by 53 votes, after counting.
Mr. Palmer moved on to the idea of remodeling the suffrage collection system to speed up the process.
The girls of Tony Abbott, Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the vote is over?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why can't we have a system in which you can enter, enter your coordinates into a computer, vote immediately and have the result at 6:30 a.m. the next morning?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of paper pencils to mark ballots.
Is it in order to erase the result if someone disagrees?
Nowadays, having a pencil of paper seems extraordinary.
The Electoral Commission has examined options for electronic voting and recently published a joint reflection paper with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer, 59, said that his political project included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new functions "very seriously".
The exercise of public functions is a matter of public service.
"We are not looking for rewards except for the reward of history because we must serve the community at a critical time," he added.
A team of biologists led by the Wildlife Conservation Society in New York identified a new species of boss dolphin off the northern coast of Australia.
Thibaut Bouveroux, Head of Scientific Mission to the Observatory for the Conservation and Study of Marine Animals and Milieus (OCEAMM) returns to L'Express on this discovery and explains the long process of identifying new species.
Does the discovery of this new species of bough dolphin surprise you?
That's good news, but I'm not particularly surprised.
While in the past, species have been described and identified on a morphological, anatomical and geographical basis, today the development of new tools such as genetics allows us to improve our knowledge in species classification sciences.
It is not impossible for these advances in genetics and molecular biology to question the classification or belonging of a species to a genus, family or even an order.
At the beginning of the 19th century, morphologists classified animals based on morphological differences between species.
Today, some of these classifications are called into question because of advances in genetics.
Likewise, two very close species morphologically have been distinguished through genetics.
This is the case of the new species that has just been identified.
About ten years ago, the scientific community recognized two species belonging to this subfamily: the Pacific Boss dolphins and Atlantic Boss whales.
Recent analyses have identified four species.
Why is this an important discovery as claimed by the Wildlife Conservation Society?
From a conservation point of view, it is essential to know these genetic differences in order to protect the species and thus its genetic variability.
If this population had been known for a long time by researchers, they did not know that it was part of a new species, present only in this area.
Therefore, if a problem of mass mortality caused by a viral epidemic or accidental capture occurs in the region, we could have a case of extinction of a species, rather than a local disappearance of a population of a more widely spread species on Earth.
This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic.
A species is considered endangered or threatened by the number of individuals existing on Earth, i.e. stock, and the possibility of recovery from nearby stocks.
As for the species Sousa chinensis, whose population of the new discovered species has emerged, its stock has automatically become weaker, making it more vulnerable.
Why is it rare to discover new species of marine mammals?
Marine mammals are located at the top of the food chain.
They live in homogenous, open habitats, where there are many genetic exchanges between populations and individuals.
This gene blend limits the creation of new species.
On the other hand, more closed ecosystems promote genetic isolation, which can eventually lead to the creation of new species.
It must be known that the marine environment is the least well known environment.
We prefer to send robots to Mars, rather than to know what lives in the Mariannes pit, only 11 kilometres from the sea surface.
We spend more money on the quest for life on other planets than on marine research and it's high time that it changes.
RBS suspends two traders on the foreign exchange market
Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange market from two sources close to the file, which shows once again that the global survey of regulators on suspicions of currency market manipulations is beginning to bear fruit.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they were cooperating with regulators in the most important financial market surveys in the world, where $5.3 billion of US dollars change hand in hand every day.
Both traders are the first RIB employees to be suspended in the context of the expansion of the investigation that echoes the scandal of the manipulations of the Libor interbank rate.
The bank, which refused to comment on the suspensions, confirmed that this month had received requests for information from regulators.
"The ongoing investigation into this case continues and we cooperate fully with the FCA and other regulators," said a bank representative two weeks ago.
Last month, sources close to the file stated that RBS had sent instant e-mails and messages, sent to and by a former trader, to the British regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RIB in 2010 and was allegedly suspended from his post as European Trade Manager to the currency account at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, European cash trading manager at Citi, was released this week, while Matt Gardner, senior foreign exchange trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been charged.
Mr. Usher's file included instant messages sent to and from bankers working at Barclays and Citigroup added sources close to the file.
UBS explained this week that it had attempted an action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator, Finma, stated that it was investigating suspicions of foreign exchange market manipulation in a number of Swiss banks.
In the world, at least six authorities â the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority â examine allegations made about bankers who would have agreed to manipulate exchange rates.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and CrÃ©dit Suisse also launched internal investigations or received requests from regulators for information, indicated sources close to the file.
Banks use instant messages and emails sent for years to find cases of wrongdoing.
News about these surveys has shaken traders in a sector that has been one of the largest growth engines of investment bank trading units in recent years, but which has been challenged this year due to the low volatility of currencies that limits the opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to minimize the case by saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast market for highly liquid exchange, but senior traders explain that this is not necessarily true.
A senior trader stated that despite the high volume of daily exchange transactions, the fragmentation of liquidity between trading management platforms and the increasingly frequent use by banks of their own internal platforms "explains that it is possible to start having an impact on the low-cost market."
The news came on the very day when Credit Switzerland announced that it had returned a trader working in its fund office negotiated the London Stock Exchange this week after it caused a loss of $6 million at the end of last year.
The bank quickly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with the regulators.
"We are convinced that the trader acted alone and that the case was mastered," said a representative of the Swiss Credit.
Mayor Rob Ford's investigation has been framed, supports a lawyer
After the police confirmed having put their hands on a copy of the video that would show Rob Ford smoking crack, Clayton Ruby claimed that he had never seen an investigation "so broken".
Ruby told me to believe in The Canadian Press that the police had "ignored or minimized" the evidence against the mayor.
On Thursday, the police arrested Rob Ford's casual driver, Alexander Lisi, aged 35, and accused him of extortion in connection with the video.
Alexander Lisi, previously accused of drug trafficking, was in frequent contact with the mayor.
The police said they also observed this man delivering packages to Rob Ford, indicating new court documents.
Ruby called me "inexplicable" the fact that the police never searched Rob Ford's vehicle or home, or listened to his phone, claiming that police chief Bill Blair chose knowing why he didn't act against the mayor.
Under the law, the police, having witnessed suspicious transactions in their own hands, could very well intercept Rob Ford's vehicle, arrest the mayor, and conduct a search - even without a warrant.
It could have also requested an instant search warrant, if it deemed necessary.
The chief of police did not comment, but his spokesman Mark Pugash described Me Ruby's words as "obvious and desperate attempt" to argue with the media in a case that does not concern him at all.
At the press conference on Thursday, Mr. Blair stated that there was nothing in this video that could constitute "reasonable reasons" that could lead to the filing of a criminal charge against the mayor.
European Fellowships going down at mid-session, except London
With the exception of London, the main European scholarships are moving downwards on Friday to mid-seat, led by some news from disappointing companies, while Wall-Street is expected to rise.
In addition, investors remain cautious because they believe that the U.S. Federal Reserve could reverse its policy of quantitative flexibility earlier than expected.
On the other hand, after the announcement of 0.7% inflation for the euro area as a whole, the idea spreads among market players that the European Central Bank (ECB) could ease its monetary policy.
The futures of Wall Street anticipate an opening of the American stock increases, after two consecutive refill sessions.
In the values, Renault (-4.63%) records the strongest replica of ACC 40, led by the warning on the outcome of its partner Nissan Motor Friday.
Royal Bank of Scotland (-6.26%) marks the worst performance of EuroFirst300, after having also published declining results this morning and announces the internal creation of a "bad bank" facility of 38 billion pounds of most risky assets.
For his part, Vodafone (+2.45 per cent) remains at the forefront of EuroFirst300's increases in response to press information that wants AT&T to study a possible OPA.
On the foreign exchange market, speculations on the evolution of the ECB's monetary policy are on the right track, as stated by John Hardy, a strategist at Saxo Bank.
The single mandate of the ECB has always focused on inflation, so Mario Draghi and his team have more reasons to act at the next week's meeting.
We look forward to a strong potential for a decline in the euro.
In this context, the euro continues its reply against the US currency and has affected in the session a lower than two weeks to $1.3517.
These same conjectures support, on the contrary, the binding market in the euro area.
The Supreme Court validates the Obama Health System Reform Act
Great victory for the Obama administration: the U.S. Supreme Court today stated that Obama's health system reform law was constitutional.
By 5 votes to 4, the judges validated the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act â which requires citizens to subscribe to health insurance by 2014, under the penalty of having to pay a fine â and stated that it was constitutional under the government's tax authority.
The President of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, joined the four most liberal members of the Court, while Justices Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy expressed disagreement.
The Court also validated the other sections of the 2,700-page Act and also considered that the provision of the Health System Reform Act, which stipulates that the eligibility threshold for Medicaid should be lowered if all federal funding of the program is lost, was coercive in accordance with the Constitution.
The procedure for blocking the law was initiated by 26 States and the National Federation of Independent Business.
All major Republican candidates for the presidential election in high school in 2012, including the designated candidate Mitt Romney, were fiercely opposed to the law.
Vibrating tribute to the Veterans in Menton
At the heart of the Trabuquet cemetery, civil, religious and military authorities, as well as many patriotic associations, paid tribute this afternoon to the soldiers and the dead of all wars.
Gerbes were deposited in two of the three military squares of the cemetery by Deputy Minister Jean-Claude Guibal and various personalities.
Locking between Palestinians and Israelis at the Gaza border
Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers injured on Thursday, October 31, 2013 during a violent siege to the Gaza border with Israel, the most serious incident in Palestinian territory for a year.
The only power plant in the Gaza Strip ceased to operate on Friday, 1 November after a depletion of its fuel stocks, announced the Palestinian enclave's Energy Authority.
A local commander of the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, Khaled Abu Bakr, and another member of the Hamas armed branch, Rabieh Barikeh, were killed by a tank shell shot during an Israeli army raid east of Khan Younes, in the south of the Gaza Strip, according to local medical sources.
Two other local leaders of the Al-Qassam Brigades, Mohammed al-Qassas and Mohammed Daoud, were killed when an Israeli helicopter opened fire in the same region.
Their bodies were discovered later.
According to Palestinian security sources, the four combatants conducted a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian enclave and Israel.
An attack on a tunnel dug up by the Palestinians
According to the same sources and witnesses, an Israeli tank and an armored bulldozer raided about 100 metres into the territory before withdrawing.
The confrontation lasted half an hour, according to witnesses.
In a communiquÃ©, a Hamas spokesman, Sami Abu Zuhri, paid tribute to the four "heroes" and stated that Israeli soldiers had found death during the confrontation.
Hamas congratulates Al-Qassam's heroes who have fallen by defending the territory during an incursion by the Zionist occupant in Khan Youns.
Several enemies were killed and injured during the operation.
"Hamas ensures that Gaza will be a hell for the occupant," threatened the spokesman.
For its part, the Israeli army indicated that the target of its operation was initially a section of a large tunnel dug up in Israeli territory since the Palestinian enclave, discovered on 7 October and destined, according to the army, to "terrorist activities".
Hamas claimed the use of tunnels to fight against Israel, stating that the aim was to remove Israeli soldiers to trade them against Palestinian prisoners.
The operation aimed at preventing future terrorist attacks using this tunnel, explained an Israeli military communiquÃ©.
During the operation, Hamas triggered an explosive weapon directed at the forces of Tsahal (the Israeli army) and wounded 5 soldiers.
Israeli attack in northern Syria
"This mission was imperative due to the risk of using the terrorist tunnel for attacks on Israeli civilians," said Army spokesman Peter Lerner.
In addition, Israel struck an air military base in northwest Syria, aimed at a missile cargo for the Lebanese Shia Hezbollah movement, reported the Al-Arabiya satellite chain on Thursday, 31 October.
One U.S. official confirmed an "Israeli strike" but did not provide details on the target.
"In the past, the targets were missiles transferred to Hezbollah," he merely added.
Israeli government officials refused to confirm any information concerning such an attack.
Citing "exclusive sources" that it did not appoint, the Saudi capital chain said that "the bombing targeted a shipment of ground-air missiles destined for Hezbollah in Lebanon", referring to the powerful Lebanese Shia movement that fights rebels alongside Syrian forces.
Earlier, a Syrian NGO, the Syrian Human Rights Observatory, reported several explosions heard on Wednesday at dawn in an air defence base in Sonar JablÃ©, near LattaquiÃ©, on the Syrian coast.
This organization based on a network of militants and medical sources had not been able to identify the origin of the explosions.
Back in black and white for Marie Chouinard, who presents her two new group choreographies at Dance Dance: the first inspired by the inks and poems of Henri Michaux, the second breathed by the famous piano solos Gymnopedies of Satie.
An evening that allows you to see all the prism of Chouinard, from art to tic and black to white.
A white screen serves as a background wall.
On the carpet, also white, in the immense space that is the Maisonneuve Theatre, progresses, profile, fine as a line and dressed in black, a body.
On the screen, an ink of Henry Michaux is projected.
The body, simple line, takes its shape.
And this form will be that of the entire piece: a thread of physical imitations of drawings.
The dancers, fully dressed in black, only the hands and face discovered, wait on each side of the playing area, rush when the next graph appears, incarnate it, emerge in current.
This black and white game by Henri Michaux is done in solo relays, in group together (a mass that makes solo), in large group of twelve solos where each performs its sign.
We think of "Glory of the morning", where, in solo, Chouinard performed a series of choreographic tasks written on posters, posted online at the front stage.
It's the same principle, giant PowerPoint version.
Here, music is strong, percussions and electric guitars.
The energy is high, the pace is always fast.
There will be a break when Carol Prieur will take refuge under the dance rug, to deliver, micro in hand, without sobriety or restraint, a part of Michaux's poem, monocord and monotone in the scream, and will continue to dance.
And the music to go back, and the sequence to resume.
This sound and energetic discharge, long, if possible, ends up souring and swallowing.
As does the regularity of the visual rhythm.
There are some beautiful flashes - the creation of images has always been a force at Chouinard - like these hairs that fade or these black fabrics that lengthen the lines.
But the choreographic approach lacks composition.
It seems that the choreographer, instead of going to meet Michaux's work, was imposed, with his tics.
Result: the bodies appear flat in front of the drawings.
The inks of Michaux, like shapes of Gestalt, open a wider and giboeous imaginary than dancing, more porous.
Only the end, in negative, with its dancers ached by a stroboscopic light and the white signs in a theatre suddenly black, touches the magic.
The audience loved it, the reception was warm.
The Gymnopedies, after the intrusion, are richer.
The stage is partly flagged with grey, dancers and a piano are covered with fabrics, like furniture in a abandoned house.
At the piano, dancers were retiring to play the scores.
Their misdirections in music, touching, give real fragility.
On stage, they pass couples, in love duos, very sensual, even erotic.
Group work, small transition solos, moving sets, choirs, writing is less binary.
Ridicules appear, also familiar with Chouinard, treeing the red nose, in love parades very polarized men-women.
Loves are carnasses, runaways or players.
The gestures, laughter and small cries beautifully transpose the archaic, grace and ridicule of coitous bodies, beings that merge.
But the coin takes its real flight after salvation.
A clown comes back to the scene when the audience leaves.
There everything becomes permitted: the fourth wall falls, the universes explored overlap, the dancers cabotin, descend among the spectators, gloss, smoke, short-circuit, play the codes of applause, stretch the sauce in a wisely calculated disorder that remains sensual.
Joy and madness breathe, and it is Chouinard's art, there, to contaminate the public.
Google, Samsung and Huawei are subject to legal proceedings concerning Nordl patents
The group that owns thousands of former Nordl patents has launched an avalanche of patent prosecutions on Thursday against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, the company that he held at the postpost during the sale of patent auctions that took place after the bankruptcy of Nortel.
Rockstar, the consortium that acquired the Nordl patents for $4.5 million, filed a complaint against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other patent infringement companies before the U.S. Seat Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
Patents contain technologies that allow advertising related to Internet search terms, have indicated the conclusions of the trial, which is the core of Google's business.
It was not possible to join the representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC manufacture phones that work under Google's Android operating system, which gives fierce competition to Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial offer of $900 million for Nordl patents.
Google has increased its offer several times, finally proposing $4.4 Md.
After losing the Nordl patents in front of Rockstar, Google subsequently acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 million, a partially based market based on Motorola's patent library.
"Although Google failed in its attempt to acquire the patents in question during the auctions, it violated and continued to violate those patents," said the trial findings.
Rockstar claims more damage and interests against Google because he claims that Google's patent violation is obstinacy, according to the complainant.
Explosion of a house in Gesves: a defective water heater at the origin of the explosion
The grandmother would have lit a cigarette during a gas leak.
The explosion of a dwelling in Gesves, which made two serious injuries on Friday morning, a 52-year-old grandmother and her 5-year-old grandson, is due to a gas leak from a defective water heater, indicated Friday evening the deputy of the King's attorney.
The expert posted on site by the parquet ensures that the origin of the explosion is purely accidental.
The grandmother lit a cigarette while there was a leak and a build-up of gas.
The vital prognosis of the two victims is still under way.
The grandmother was projected by the explosion and was severely burned.
The little boy, who was staying with his grandfather and his companion, was beside him and was burned more lightly.
"The two victims were intubated and long conditioned on site before being taken to the CHU of LiÃ¨ge, she was in helicopter, she was in an ambulance," said Master JosÃ© Paulet, who came down to the scene.
Traumatized, the grandfather was upstairs at the time of the explosion.
Safe and except, he was able to reach the ground floor by the staircase remained intact while the back wall of the house was completely destroyed.
The grandfather and the landlord of the next house, weakened by the explosion, were relocated by the president of CPAS.
The firemen of Andenne and Namur and the Arches police intervened.
The civil protection of CrisenÃ©e stabilized both buildings.
Egypt asks the first freely elected President to swear
Mohamed Morsi lent the oath of investment, but it is unlikely that his day of triumph will mark the end of political conflicts in Egypt.
Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised the emergence of a "new Egypt" when he lent the oath of investment to the presidency, thus becoming the first freely elected president and succeeding in Hosni Moubarak who was expelled from power 16 months earlier.
During his investment in the High Constitutional Court, Mr Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamic president of the Arab world and the fifth head of State of Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy 60 years ago.
He swore in front of the 18 judges in the black robe of the Court whose building on the edge of the Nile was built to resemble an Egyptian temple.
"We aspire to better days, a new Egypt and a second republic," said President Morsi during the solemn ceremony broadcast live on public television.
"Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life â absolute freedom, true democracy and stability," said Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer trained in the United States from the Muslim Brothers, a fundamentalist group considered for more than 84 years since his formation as an illegal and severely repressed organization by successive governments.
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen kept the building when Mr. Morsi arrived shortly after 11 a.m., local time, followed by a small convoy.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered before the Court to hail the new president and, starting from the presidential phase of the Moubarak years, circulation was only briefly interrupted to allow the passage of his convoy into the very frequent streets connecting the city centre to the southern suburbs.
Considered as the charismatic "relief wheel" of the Muslim Brothers, his personal prestige has been greatly enhanced since his victory and his speech on Friday during which he tried to present himself not only as the candidate of Islamists but of all those who want to finish the work begun during the 2011 uprising against authoritarian President Moubarak.
"Egypt is now a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," Mohamed Morsi said, in a blue suit and a red tie, addressing the judges present in the panelroom where he swore.
Later, Mr. Morsi visited Cairo University, where he delivered his investment speech.
He was officially welcomed by a military fanfare who played the national anthem while he was in custody.
The Marshal Hussein Tantaoui attended the ceremony.
Upon his arrival, he was greeted by the song "The people and the army, hand in hand...", haunted by thousands gathered in the great amphitheatre of the university.
Founded in 1908 and the former foundation of secular education, the University of Cairo later became a fief of Islamic student groups in the 1970s.
Mr. Morsi made a symbolic oath on Friday on Tahrir Square, from which the uprising which ended the authoritarian regime in Moubarak last year, and swore to recover the presidential powers of which the military council, which replaced the former President-in-Office, deposed him.
But by agreeing to formally swear before the Court, rather than before Parliament as it is used, he bows to the will of the army by showing that the struggle for power is not over.
Mr. Morsi's speech on Tahrir Square was accompanied by spectacular populist gestures.
USA's shutdown has slowed the increase in the car market
The closure for 16 days of most federal administrations weighed on the growth of car sales in the United States in October, showing the figures published by the manufacturers on Friday, five of the six main performing lower than expected.
Detroit's three major manufacturers display two-digit growth compared to October 2012 but only General Motors did better than expected.
Analysts anticipated an average of 15.4 million annualized and seasonally adjusted sales, but the market stood at 15.3 million according to the estimates of Morgan Stanley's analyst Adam Jonas.
In a note to the bank's customers, he believes that this slight brake blow is primarily explained by "the government's 'shutdown' and its impact on the consumer's feeling during the first fifteen of the month."
However, GM reported a rise of nearly 16% of its sales last month to 226 402 vehicles, compared to 211 563 expected by consensus.
The group's four brands saw their trade performance improved compared to October 2012.
Ford, who continues to benefit, among other things, from the success of its pick-up, saw its sales advance from 14% over a year to 191,985 vehicles, while the consensus expected 194,301.
For his part, Chrysler, controlled by Fiat announced an increase of 11% of its sales to 140,083 vehicles, compared to 143,536 expected.
Toyota and Nissan also show sales below consensus, despite increases over one year of 8.8% and 14.2%, respectively.
At the New York Stock Exchange, GM won 1.4% at 16.35 GMT while Ford gave in 1.1%.
Renault plunged into Stock Exchange by Nissan's warning
Renault accuses of the biggest decline in the SBF 120 index in Paris on Friday after its partner Nissan Motor announced that it has reduced by almost 20% its forecast of annual net profit, reports traders.
Nissan, who had to carry out such a review, also announced a change in his direction.
Several traders reported that Renault was affected this morning by the "warning".
"It's clearly Nissan's warning profit," said a manager of the trading of a Parisian broker.
Under the Renault-Nissan alliance, Renault owns 43.4% of Nissan's capital and the Japanese builder 15% of French, according to data from Nissan's website.
Greece: Two dead in a gunfight near a neo-Nazi party site
Two people were killed and another was severely injured on Friday night by shots fired by two people on a motorcycle passing in front of a neo-Nazi party site Golden Dawn in the western suburb of Athens, was learned as a police source.
The police were currently unable to provide information on the identity of the victims and their possible political affiliation.
Some Greek media reported that members of Golden Dawn argued that the victims were guards of their premises.
The injured person was immediately hospitalized, depending on the same source.
Police officers from the anti-terrorist service rushed to the central avenue of Neo Iraklio suburb, where the incident took place and locked the neighborhood.
The incident occurred a few weeks after the indictment of six Golden Dawn MPs, including the leader and founder of the party, for participation in "a criminal organization" in an offensive against this party launched after the death of an anti-fascist musician by one of its members.
Scott Brown's appeal rejected
Scott Brown, the captain of Celtic Glasgow, has seen his appeal rejected and will be well suspended for the next two league league matches of his club, against Ajax and AC Milan.
Exposed against BarÃ§a for having addressed Neymar, the Scottish community saw its extended suspension at three meetings by UEFA.
In a press release, his club said "very disappointed", believing that his appeal was entirely justified.
Nearly 50,000 households are deprived of electricity throughout the province, shortly after noon on Friday, due to violent winds affecting many regions along the St. Lawrence River.
The most affected sectors are Laurentides with 15,042 subscribers immersed in the black, MontÃ©rÃ©gie with 13,464 and Outaouais with 8642.
The large region of Montreal also knows its lot of panics with nearly 7,000 private homes of electricity in the metropolis and Laval.
You thought travel agencies belonged to the past because of the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to reverse the trend.
The company has revised its forecast of net profit to rise and hopes for record results thanks to vacationers in Australia and the United Kingdom.
The travel agency now expects to achieve an underlying benefit over the entire fiscal year between $325 and $340 million before taxes, compared to a previous forecast of $305 to $315 million.
If current forecasts are achieved, this will represent 12 to 17% growth compared to the record profit of $290.4 million in 2011/12.
The Director General, Graham Turner, stated that Flight Centre had made 8% profits in the first half of the year and that the second half had begun to force, in particular with regard to travel other than business trips in Australia and the United Kingdom.
"Since the beginning of the year, the 10 countries in which we are present are profitable, and several of them are in a good way to achieve record results on the entire fiscal year before deduction of interest and taxes," he said.
This concerns Australia and the United Kingdom, which are generally the countries generating the largest profits.
In Australia, the leisure travel sector increased during the second half of the year, making it possible to compensate a domestic market for a slight decline in business travel.
Similarly in the United Kingdom, the Flight Centre's leisure travel sector has achieved good results, while business customers have spent less.
Its subsidiary in the United States recovered its losses in the first half of the year where seasonal demand is lower and had to gain a benefit over the entire year for the third consecutive time.
Flight Centre shares increased by 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Unknowns shoot on a hotel near the Cairo pyramids
Unsullied strangers opened fire this Friday on a hotel near the Cairo pyramids in Egypt without making victims, as a result of a seeming quarrel with fired employees.
The attackers fled, said the spokesperson of the Ministry of the Interior, Police General Abdel Latif.
This attack occurs when Egypt no longer receives almost no tourists since the army removed Islamic President Mohamed Morsi in early July and suppresses in the blood the demonstrations of its supporters.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
As part of English literature classes, students will need to study at least one Shakespeare play, a 19th century novel, a romantic poem and contemporary British fiction from 1914 to the present day.
The review will also present "new texts" to encourage more diverse reading.
A combined English language and literature course will be deleted.
From 2015, students will have to pass an independent-language GCSE, and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate qualification in English literature.
The Ministry of Education is expected to publish its new English and math programs tomorrow â the first subjects to undergo radical revision.
It will make changes in other fundamental subjects next year.
In addition, Ofqual, the Regulatory Bureau of Examinations, will unveil a remodeling of the structure of the GCSEs, with a new rating system and fewer courses.
Speaking during the summer, Michael Gove, Minister of Education, stated that there was a "wide consensus on the need to reform our review system to restore public confidence," insisting that the GCSEs would be "more stimulating, more ambitious and more rigorous."
Studies show that English schools spend less time on maths (116 hours per year, 3 hours per week during the school year) than most other countries.
In comparison, Australian schools offer an average of 143 hours a year, and students from Singapore offer about 138 hours a year.
Although there is no formal obligation to devote more hours of time to maths, sources close to the coalition government have indicated that the deep maths GCSE â as well as the greater importance given to subjects in international rankings â would likely encourage schools to provide more class hours.
The programme will focus more on the "problems of the real world", including financial mathematics.
This judgment means that a law adopted in July in that State and which largely questions the right to abortion will be able to enter into force.
An octogenary welcomes children with a muy rifle for Halloween
Juveniles aged 9 and 13 were making door-to-door calls for candy on Halloween evening.
One of the river banks of the Muchi neighborhood visited by the children opened the door holding his hunting rifle.
The old man, 86 years old, explained to the gendarmes that he was afraid.
His weapon was seized.
The former Chief of the Gestapo buried in a Jewish cemetery
MÃ¼ller, who disappeared at the end of World War II without ever finding his mark, was actually buried in a common grave of a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, asserts the leader of the German Resistance Memorial, Professor Johannes Tuchel, in Bild.
MÃ¼ller did not survive the end of the war.
"His body was buried in 1945 in a common grave of the Jewish cemetery in Berlin-Mitte," he assured the daily large-scale shoot based on archival documents.
This revelation, 68 years after the end of the Nazi regime of Adolf Hitler, would respond to one of the great enigmas of the Afterwar.
The German secret services, the BND, were held as well as during the summer of 1949, MÃ¼ller was in Karlovy Vary, then in Czechoslovakia, according to a paper obtained by Bild.
Secret services were totally wrong.
"Since August 1945, MÃ¼ller's body was found in a provisional tomb near the former Reich Aviation Ministry by a commando," said Mr.Tuchel.
He was wearing "a general uniform."
"In the inner left pocket were especially his service status with a photo," he continued.
Bild also publishes a document from the district district of Mitte in Berlin indicating that he was buried in the Jewish cemetery in the district.
The President of the Central Council of Jews of Germany, Dieter Graumann, was shocked by this revelation.
One of the cruelest Nazi sadists to be buried in a Jewish cemetery is an enormous amount of bad taste.
"The memory of the victims is grossly on the foot," he remarked in the newspaper.
Heinrich MÃ¼ller is one of the leading figures in the Third Reich who have never been captured.
He attended the Wannsee conference in January 1942, which decided on the "final solution" and was under his orders Adolf Eichmann, responsible for the "logistics" of the extermination of the Jews, sentenced to death and executed in Israel in 1962.

He walks in the mud, jungle and crosses rivers to offer free medical assistance
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free health care in the villages of Cameroon
Dr. Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend seeing hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in this West African country, just 1 per 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or via your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 Heroes CNN of 2013.
You can vote for him, or one of the other 10 heroes, for the election "Heros CNN of the Year".
This person will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his sick father alter the periods of consciousness and unconsciousness and go to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near YaoundÃ©, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he had only one arm broken, but he contracted an infection that spread to his brain, creating a hematoma that he was going to carry the sequelae for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," said Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken him abroad if we had had enough money.
Instead, Dr. Bwelle spent years accompanying his father in hospitals and clinics to get any treatment he could receive.
"It's not easy," adds Mr. Bwelle.
You can leave the house at 5 am, run to the hospital to be the first, and you're not the first.
There are many patients.
People can die because they wait too long.
The situation has not changed much since Dr. Bwelle's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there are only 1 doctor per 5,000 inhabitants, according to the World Health Organization.
As a comparison, the ratio in the United States is 1 doctor per 413 inhabitants.
And even if they could see a doctor, many Cameroonians couldn't pay for the consultation.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of the country's health expenditures are carried out in the private sector.
"The only problem they have is poverty," explained Dr. Bwelle.
And because of poverty, they cannot enjoy life.
After seeing his father and so many fellow countrymen suffer, Dr. Bwelle was determined to try to change the course of things.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers performed more than 700 surgical acts free of charge last year.
He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon at YaoundÃ© central hospital.
And he created a non-profit humanitarian association, ASCOVIME, which goes to rural areas during the weekends to provide free health care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, with about thirty people, they set off in vans after having fixed the medical equipment on the roof and crossed difficult terrains to travel to villages that most need help.
Chance doesn't always follow them.
They have often had to push the vehicles to cross rivers or boulevard tracks.
But when they arrive, they are received as heroes: the community organizes a party, sings and dances and offers them the best available accommodations.
In these villages, free health care is a good reason to celebrate, and Dr. Bwelle â with his great smile and overwhelming energy â is more than happy to join the festivities.
The next morning, the team began to receive hundreds of patients.
"We receive 500 people on each visit," said Mr. Bwelle.
They sometimes live 60 km from the village, and they come on foot.
In this travelling hospital, various health care is provided.
Many people receive treatment against malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive beehives, a pair of glasses collected or a free birth certificate â document needed to go to school, but many poor families simply cannot afford to buy it.
In the evening, the practical team of simple surgical acts under local anesthesia.
The operations are usually performed in a school, city hall or house; after the intervention, the patient gets up and goes to the waking room to leave his place to the next person.
Thanks to the lighting of the generator, the operating room and the sterilization of the equipment, Dr. Bwelle and his volunteers worked until the early hours of Sunday morning.
It's an exciting rhythm, but village musicians generally help the team to stay motivated.
"They hit drums all night to keep us awake so that we can continue to work," said Mr.Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team returned to town, tired but proud of the work it had done.
The group, composed of Cameroonian doctors and medical students, performed 700 surgical acts free of charge last year, and knows that their presence can make all the difference for those whom they help.
One man explained that the free operation he had undergone to treat a hernia would allow him to work again.
"It will change my future and that of my family," said the man.
In addition to making this travelling hospital live and working as a surgeon at the hospital, Dr. Bwelle also works at night in private medical offices around YaoundÃ©.
It is this second job, he explains, that funds 60% of his association; the rest is covered by private donations.
"I don't know when he sleeps," said Katie O'Malley, a second-year medical student from Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteer in Dr. Bwelle's group.
He's still in the hospital or trying to find money for his association so he can run these campaigns.
For medical students and nursing students such as Katie O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr. Bwelle in his missions, this is a learning opportunity on the ground that they do not have at home.
"We were able to participate in operations to help drain the blood or pass the instruments to Dr. Bwelle," said Ms. O'Malley.
This is not something you have the opportunity to do in America when you are a medical student in the second year.
Volunteer students generally pay for their trip to Cameroon, and often arrive with medical equipment collected.
But once in YaoundÃ©, their pensions, transportation and education are taken care of by Dr. Bwelle.
"He's a hero, there's no doubt," said Katie O'Malley.
He gives his life for this association, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is not close to extinction.
For Dr. Bwelle, the relatively constant workload is not a challenge.
Helping others to live happily by keeping the promise he made to his father is something that brings him immense joy.
"I am so happy when I do this work," said Mr. Bwelle.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
Making people laugh and relieve pain are the reasons why I do this.

The two Frances of Pierre Nora
Cursed, academics have long painted to define and place Pierre Nora.
Professor in amphitheaters and classrooms?
Perhaps, but stressing its weakness for the crossing paths, Sciences-Po, the High Studies.
Arbitrator of other works in his office on Gaston-Gallimard Street?
Yes, but ignoring the editor's hidden work and underground writing.
Heir of the chair that occupied Fontenelle at the French Academy?
True, but knowing that such a sacred oil cannot replace the true holy oil, that of the the thesis, of which it happened.
They willingly recognized in him a great awakener, animator and federator of their works, but noting that he was reluctant to produce them himself.
To this uncertain image the monument of the "Places of memory", to which he attached his name, also contributed.
Bad languages have been able to see a giant flea market, presented by an intelligent commentator, with a keen eye-brow and a faint erudition, but incurably delightful.
The two books published by Nora soon two years ago have already established that the one who passed away from writing had much and well written.
This book should ultimately render him justice.
However, once again, there is the temptation of ubiquity, intellectual wandering, the jubilation that has to be jumped as feet attached from one subject to another.
But we quickly understand that the disparate objects gathered in this book in such a beautiful title bring the booklet to one and the same passion: to discover the constitutive node of French identity.
Why these dramatic calls to national unity?
Identity: it's a concern of the time.
Here we have been collectively invited to give a definition.
But in the peremptory spirit of our leaders then, the French identity was an timeless essence.
It was only necessary to deploy the accidents, and the case, Jacobinism requires, was entrusted to the prefects and sub-prefects, authorized interpreters.
The one Pierre Nora is all the other.
He does not become the heir to an eternal franchise, he refuses to define himself.
Concerned analyst of familiar strangeness, he wanders into a forest of symbols, stopped at every step by an object in the form of rebus, tormented by irritating questions.
The company, which is born of the company itself: why, in a country so long lastingly settled on its borders, so anciently charpent and firmly grounded, do we hear these dramatic calls to unity?
They are so pressing, suggests Pierre Nora, only to conjure up the disorder born of the disagreements of French history.
Francs and Gaulois, Armagnacs and Bourguignons, Catholics and Protestants: the forces of division, here, are very old.
And the most emblematic is of course the one that divides national history into two.
From the earthquake of the Revolution, the French have two stories and they have two nations, one monarchist, the other revolutionary.
The second wanted the death of the first, but without succeeding to deny it; rather, he was concerned about finding the sacredness of it and the desire for unity and indivisibility that it had cut his head off to the one who was the obvious and powerful incarnation.
And from there, an invincible binary nation, shared between left and right, secularism and Catholicism, worship and hatred of the revolution.
To make this singularity of French identity feel, nothing is worth the four not out of the Hexagon, so that Pierre Nora's American escape might well be the heart of his book.
Because America and France have both made a revolution, drafted a declaration of rights, wanted to establish a new society.
But American sewing only makes it better to highlight what is our own.
There, men who had left their Old Regime in England and had no need to worry about it.
Here, men in charge of an Old Indigenous Regime, and even more radical.
There a consensual revolution when here she sowed the drama and confidant it.
There are always honored founding fathers, and here are revolutionary ancestors whose models are hard to make, and who have been of the rest killed.
There is an institutional constancy, and here is a cascade of constitutions, like as many errors to catch up and trials to resume.
France that leaves, France that comes
However, there was a time when the French thought they could cover the torn robe of their history, and overcome the curse of the number two.
At this III Republic, a central and creative moment, Pierre Nora showed a great deal of interest and even tenderness: welcoming those who then worked to repair the revolutionary divide, teaching the schoolchildren everything in the old France prepared obscurely modern France and offering them a unified version of their history.
But this peaceful identity had only one time.
This is again under discussion, blocked by an immigration of a new type, threatened by the rise of claimed minorities, absorbed in the European space.
The book therefore offers both the fascinating portrait of France that leaves and the circumspect sketch of France that comes.
With, in bonus, the portrait of the historian, who should book some surprises.
We found out that the fireplace was a housekeeper.
The man of multiple curiosity turned, slightly obsessive, around the same idea.
The edger was standing in the center of the center.
And the one who had deposited, this is more than half a century, a subject on the idea of nation, but he had avoided the initial exercise of the thesis, entrusts us, cum grain salts, that he will eventually do it.
True in a less stiff, more bursting and more subtle form.
But we are not wrong, just as binding.
Because much more than the figure imposed on the university course, this thesis says the inner necessity of a life.
An old hostage in Lebanon: "Return is quite complex to manage"
He was kidnapped in Beirut on 8 March 1986 with three members of his team of "Antenna 2" who filmed a Hezbollah event, journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was released almost 21 months later, on 27 November 1987.
Retired since 2008, he has been involved in the creation of the "Otages of the World" hostage defense association, which he has been chairing for several years.
Its main objective: to obtain the opportunity for hostages to lodge complaints and bring their hostages to the International Criminal Court.
With more than 1,000 days in detention, the four Aqmi hostages (Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb) Daniel Larib, Thierry Dol, Pierre Legrand and Marc Ferret were released Tuesday.
After medical examinations at the Val-de-Grace military hospital on Wednesday afternoon, they have since been able to find their families.
And try, gradually, to resume the course of their lives.
"The New Observer" questioned Jean-Louis Normandin, 62 years old, former great reporter, retired since 2008, president of the association "Otages du monde".
From the night of your release, you were on the 20h platform of "Antenna 2".
What are your memories of your release today?
On site, among others, in Beirut.
When I'm released, I find myself in the trunk of a car where I meet - without seeing it because it's black - Roger Auque.
He tells me "we're released," but I'm not sure, and he tells me we can still be killed.
We're very excited, but very tense too.
It is war, and those who lead us are also very tender.
They're putting us on the edge of a sidewalk.
There are Syrian soldiers.
Then we arrive on the website of the Summerland hotel where the press is present.
The French bring us to the Embassy of France.
It's time for the first shots of the line to the parents, the family, friends, the press...
I remember taking a bath for an hour.
And having dinner in t-shirt at the Embassy of France.
I also remember a short night to discuss with Roger and Marchiani.
The tension is still there because we do not have the means to evacuate to Larnaca airport in Cyprus.
When we arrived there by helicopter, we took a private plane that took us back to France via Corfou and Solenzara, where Pasqua embarked.
How did your arrival on the French soil come about?
We landed at Orly.
Chirac, Prime Minister, is here.
It's kind of brutal.
There's an incredible compass.
And a lot of media.
When I left, there were three television channels.
I'm coming back and there's plenty of it.
The descent of the plane ladder, the encounters with my son and my parents, my friends, all of this is extremely strong in emotion.
Between the airport and home, many motorcycles follow our car Roussin drives.
The bikers pull their asses to take pictures and follow me to my house where I have to do some police to prevent some from getting up.
Media pressure is enormous.
It doesn't stop, we're well placed to know...
But the state of emotion and fatigue is such that it is difficult to see clearly.
We get out of a hole and we're suddenly under the media lights.
It's a little complicated, a little violent, quite complex to manage.
But we did the hardest.
In the evening, I'm at 8:00, the next day I'm on TV.
Then begins some kind of life-rehabilitation, very gently, for a month or two that are a little like vacation.
How did medical examinations and debriefing DGSE happen?
I had the right to a first medical check-up in Corsica.
The rest was made in Val-de-Grace the following days my return: radios, exams in all kinds and encounter with a psychiatrist.
It is not a session that does everything but we know that we can rely on him, remember him if necessary, that we are not delivered to ourselves.
It's part of the procedure.
I also met with the intelligence services.
They asked me questions about the hostages.
It was logical.
It didn't bother me.
How do you react today to the release of the four hostages from Niger?
I'm listening to what they say.
The debate on ransoms in particular.
Some things piss me off, others less.
I'm trying to share things between questions about my past as a hostage and my president hat of the association "Otages du monde" that allows me to distance myself, and it seems much more interesting to me to address.
I wonder, for example, about the definition of resilience.
Above all, I am fighting, along with others, for the recognition of the legal status of hostages.
I think there's a semantic problem.
It is necessary to call hostages to take hostages "political" - which is the case most of the time - and to allow hostages to have access to justice, to file complaints and to bring their hostages to the International Criminal Court.
Today, once again, everyone is in compassion, in emotion, and rejoices at the release of these hostages.
But who says that these hostages might also have access to justice?
A court in The Hague is made for this.
Why don't we say to the hostages "you've violated the rules of war, like those of all the Geneva conventions, we're going to bring you to justice"?
It seems to me, however, grounded, legitimate, struck with common sense.
This message is heard, but not heard, and it appalls me.
It's my main fight.
Egyptian Islamists on the street to denounce Morsi's trial
Angry anger in the ranks of the Egyptian Islamists.
Two days before President Mohamed Morsi's trial began, they went down the streets.
A mobilization throughout Egypt to demand the restoration of the first democratically elected President of the country.
It is not a trial that highlights this militant of the Muslim Brothers.
So far no lawyer has been able to meet him and no volunteer has been able to take a copy of the case documents.
It's not a trial, it's a farce.
President Morsi's trial is a false trial involving a pro-Morsi, he is supposed to have Sisi tried, not the other way around.
Morsi must judge Sisi for the massacres of Rabaa, Nahda massacres, and the massacre of the Republican Guard.
Sisi is a liar and a traitor.
Confrontations broke out in Alexandria, the police used tear gas, 60 demonstrators were arrested.
On Monday, 20,000 police officers will be deployed before the Cairo Police Academy, where Mohamed Morsi will be tried.
Hagel blames 9 U.S. States for violating homosexual rights
Since the federal state recognized homosexual marriage, "all members of the military are entitled to an ID card from the Department of Defence and benefits that come with it," said the Minister in New York in an address to the Anti-Defamation League to Combat Anti-Semitism.
"But some States refuse to issue these cards to same-sex spouses in the National Guard's facilities" established in their territory, he denounced them, challenging them to violate federal law and the principle of equality.
Without these cards, they cannot benefit from the many social or health services provided in these bases, or access their stores.
The Secretary of Defence said he ordered the Chief of the National Guard, General Frank Grass, to ensure the implementation of the federal law.
The nine states border began with Texas, which refused to implement these benefits on the premises of the Texas National Guard, due to a conflict between the Texas Act and the federal gay marriage law.
He was joined in his refusal by Indiana, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia, according to a senior defence officer.
The Pentagon estimates the population affected by the recognition of homosexual marriage to approximately 5600 active persons, including 17 000 National Guards, Reserves and Retirees.
Sixth edition of the Play Skateboard this Saturday in HyÃ¨res
The sixth edition of the Play Skateboard takes place on Saturday, November 2 at the skate park in HyÃ¨res.
Organized by the SK8 Unity section of the Bump Association, the competition should bring together the best skaters in the region.
Registrations are held on Saturday morning from 9 a.m. and the qualifying phases will begin at 10 a.m. before the final scheduled at 3 p.m. and the award of prices at 4 p.m.
The public will be able to admire the technical prowess of young people who, for some, already attend the competitions at the highest level, like the young hero prodigy Lorenzo Palumbo.
At only 10 years of age, he has already won his place this year for the European Championships in Copenhagen and he likes nothing as long as he shows competitors who outnumber him by three heads.
The Mayor of Toronto hunts journalists who have come to question him about a drug affair
In Canada, the Mayor of Toronto is suspected of drug abuse, according to several media.
A video brought to justice seems to support these suspicions.
The interested person, Rob Ford, has always denied having consumed crack, while acknowledging having a penchant for cannabis.
On Thursday, he drove several journalists out of his property who came to interrogate him.
We also believe that sometimes images do not need an explanation or comment.
A case of rage detected in a cat in the Val-d'Oise
The authorities announced on Thursday 31 October that a case of rage had been detected in a kitten in Val-d'Oise, manifestly of foreign origin while France has been free of Aboriginal cases since 2001.
The cat was found in Argenteuil on October 25 and died on October 28.
The diagnosis of anger was confirmed by the Pastoral Institute.
"An epidemiological survey was undertaken to identify and take care of people who could have come into contact with this kitten between October 8 and October 28 included," states the Ministries of Health and Agriculture.
"Five people who have been in contact with the kitten have already been identified" and received preventive treatment.
"In man, the preventive treatment of human anger, administered after contact with the carrier animal, but before the onset of symptoms, is very effective," says the communiquÃ©.
Departments now call those who would have been bitten, scratched, scratched, licked or licked on a mucus or on a skin damaged by that kitten or whose animal would have been in contact with that kitten between October 8 and 28, contact 08.11.00.06.95 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. from November 1st.
"France has been free of rage since 2001, this kitten or the mother has been imported from another country, not free," according to the communiquÃ©.
The Ministry of Agriculture states that the last "Aboriginal" case of identified rabies dates back to December 1998 on a fox and that "France is officially declared free of this disease in November 2001 by the International Bureau of Epizootics (OIE)".
A case of rage on a dog illegally imported from Gambia was registered in 2008.

Obama moves backwards on his health system reform
Under an avalanche of criticism, President Obama returned yesterday on his promise without ambiguity and often repeated that "if you are satisfied with your health plan, you can keep it."
After hundreds of thousands of people received notice of termination from their claimants, the Republicans criticized the president in recent days by accusing him of deceiving the American people.
Yesterday, Barack Obama adjusted his original promise.
"The vast majority of people with adequate health insurance can keep it," he said in a speech in Boston.
Speaking of what he called "an effervescence at present" about the terminations, President Obama urged Americans who received these opinions to seek new market insurance.
Most people will be able to obtain comprehensive and better suited health plans for the same price, even less expensive than expected.
"You will win," he said.
The Administration announced that it should not be surprising if the 5% of the population who are self-employed were forced to change their plans because their coverage did not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
"Let me address directly to these Americans: you deserve better," Kathleen Sebelius said in his testimony to the Committee on Energy and Trade in Washington.
Ms. Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said that the launch of the online market in October had failed "wrongly".
"I am as frustrated and irritated as anyone," she added.
I look forward to regaining your trust.
It was an exasperated Kathleen Sebelius who uttered this sentence, as she believed her micro cut, addressing an assistant sitting behind her at the meeting of the Assembly yesterday following a controversial exchange of views with Billy Long, the Republican representative of Missouri, to know whether she should join Obamacare.
For more than three hours, Billy Long repeatedly asked Ms. Sebelius why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily renounced government-sponsored insurance to subscribe to a regime via HealthCare.gov, which now boasts millions of Americans.
Vettel features a special helmet in Abu Dhabi
The happy elected Jake Vite Prekop combined the colors of the car brand and the German flag, while integrating the notions of speed and heat at the level of the track.
The German Sebastian Vettel, four-time Formula 1 World Champion, sneezed for the free trials of Abu Dhabiâs Grand Prix Friday a special helmet whose drawing was made by a 21-year-old Mexican fan.
Vettel has chosen among 1,500 drawings sent from all over the world, as part of a competition launched by one of the sponsors, an automobile brand, from his stable.
He was invited to follow Abu Dhabi's GP, with a friend, and can therefore see closely the German champion, on the track and in his stand.
Vettel was supposed to wear this helmet on Friday and Saturday to the test.
It is likely that it will have another special Sunday helmet for the race to mark its fourth consecutive world title.
A resident of Aubervilliers launches his suburban party
We're not exactly wrong.
In the spirit of Abdel-Malik Djermune, its founder, the "Parti de la banlieue" is not only addressed to the banlieusurds.
I chose a map of France as a logo, it justifies it.
When I talk about suburbanness, I address all those who are excluded from the great national family.
His project, presented on Thursday in a press conference in his hometown of Aubervilliers, was born from the desire to better defend multiculturalism, this great cultural potting that characterizes the neighborhoods above all.
My proposal is to create a Ministry of Multiculturalism, he says.
Abdel-Malik Djermune, 50 years old, territorial attachÃ©, claims today as "100% apolitical" even though it has not always been neutral.
Militant in 2002 alongside Jean-Pierre ChevÃ©nement, he then locally supported Dominique de Villepin between 2010 and 2011.
I know that the values of equality that I propose in my programme are attached to the left, but if the right-wing people are ready to support me, I will also listen to them, he continues.
There are only extremist parties I don't talk about.
In addition to multiculturalism, Abdel-Malik Djermune has built its programme -consultable on the Internet - from many topics intended to speak to the suburban inhabitants and especially to young people: the right to vote for foreigners, the legalization of cannabis, the civil majority at 16, the rehabilitation of the function of building keeper...
He remains to find candidates to form lists and defend his ideas on the political scene."For the municipal elections of 2014, it is likely to be fair, he recognizes".
It's a matter of time and money.
The suburban party should still be represented in Aubervilliers through my candidature and I also hope in other cities.
Abdel-Malik Djermouene already has seven headlists in metropolitan France and Martinique.
"And the support emails that I have received since yesterday do not all come out of banlieue" he rejoices.
John Kerry admitted, without precedent, that American espionage "had gone too far in an inappropriate way"
John Kerry indicated a slowdown in the US's defensive attitude towards its monitoring programs by admitting, without precedent, that on several occasions, espionage "was too far off in an inappropriate manner".
The Secretary of State also admitted that he, like Barack Obama, had ruled on "automatic pilot" when a series of incendiary revelations by the complainant Edward Snowden about the NSA's espionage activities came about.
The leaks put the U.S. government at the centre of a diplomatic storm with its allies.
Speaking at an intergovernmental conference in London by video link, Mr. Kerry said: "It is undeniable that the President, myself and other members of the government, learned about certain things in automatic pilot mode because we had the opportunity, from the Second World War and until the difficult years of the Cold War, and of course on September 11th."
He then became the first high-ranking member of the United States government to admit that American espionage had exceeded the borders, but insisted that everyone's rights had not been violated.
He said, "In some cases, it went too far in an inappropriate way."
And the President is determined to try to clarify and clarify clearly to people that he is now undertaking an in-depth review of these practices so that no one feels wrong.
I assure you that innocent people will not be abused in this process.
Mr. Kerry stressed, however, that the NSA was an active force for good and that its monitoring operations had saved many lives.
He added: "We live in a new world where people are ready to jump."
There is a radical extremism in the world that is determined to try to kill people, make them explode and attack governments.
What if you could intercept their communications and stop them before they act?
We have indeed prevented planes from falling, buildings from exploding and people from being murdered because we have been able to get to know the facts in advance.
In the meantime, U.S. legislators will travel to Europe to address concerns about the alleged American espionage issue and convince the Europeans of the need to continue joint efforts to combat terrorism with the United States, explained Thursday the Chair of the Senate subcommittee on European Affairs.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut stated that he had spoken before the members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about the threats they had made regarding the possible withdrawal of anti-terrorist organizations due to the frustration of the National Security Agency's supervision.
"It is really important for the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans remain on our side in mutual commitment to the fight against terrorism," said Murphy, a democrat serving his first mandate, and president of the European Affairs Subcommittee of the American Senate, during an interview from Washington.
And I will go to Europe to make them understand that we must continue to work together to combat terrorism, despite the anger caused by the NSA programmes.
The press reports that the NSA has captured millions of communications in Europe, which has damaged relations with some of the United States' allies, but the director of the agency said this week that it was inaccurate and that it was a misunderstanding because it concerned metadata that NATO's allies had collected and shared with the United States.
Other revelations reported documents disclosed by Snowden that the NSA had intercepted data and communications from the German Chancellor Angela Merkel's cell phone and 34 other heads of state.
The Director of Intelligence, James Clapper, justified allied espionage by indicating that it was necessary and that it was a common practice on both sides.
In this atmosphere of turmoil, Murphy indicated that his office was organizing a Congress trip, which was expected to take place this year, and he hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and the two chambers.
The names of other participating legislators should be disclosed in the coming days.
He indicated that the route remained to be defined.
Murphy stated that the purpose of this trip was to improve relationships, but also to show "affective firmness".
He explained that European Heads of State should be honest with their citizens about the type of espionage programmes they have been applying for years.
"We can amend our monitoring programmes to better protect European rights, but they must also understand that we are not alone in the world to do espionage," Murphy said.
In the meantime, Mr. Kerry planned to travel this weekend to the Middle East and Poland to manage the resentment generated by American strategies in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as by United States surveillance activities.
The London Stock Exchange closed down on Thursday, plunged by Shell's poor results and the following announcement by the Fed of maintaining its support for the economy, as planned.
An Australian appealed his prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old resident in Sydney who was sentenced to 15 days' imprisonment in Phuket for falsely claiming to have been assaulted by a taxi driver, appealed for trial and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty by a Phuket Province Tribunal on 15 June of false statements after telling the Thai police that a local taxi driver, accompanied by two other men who controlled her, had assaulted her early on Sunday 10 June.
However, video surveillance records later revealed that she had safely returned to her hotel after being separated from her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket's police interrogated Bamford for two days before she admitted to having invented the history of all the pieces.
She was detained in a local police station cell prior to the hearing before the court.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days' imprisonment in a low-security detention facility on the Phuket suburb rather than in a women's prison.
This is the daughter of the former Australian rugby League player Peter Tunks, who appealed to the Foreign Ministry of Canberra to help her daughter.
Tunks told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about her daughter's well-being and wanted her to return to Australia.
"We've obviously had an anxious moment, but we hope to bring her home safely as soon as possible," Tunks said.
Bamford appealed the judgment and was released after a bond of 50,000 bahts was paid.
In Australia, the press stated that in the meantime, it was on vacation in the Krabi region in southern Thailand.
Thai judicial sources indicated that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer from Phuket, but warned that the appeal could lead to an increase in the sentence of up to two years in prison and imprisonment in an adult prison.
However, after the recent murder in Phuket of Michelle Smith, an Australian travel agent, Thailand could also try to recapture its damaged image with tourists, which could lead to acquittal.
French police will arrest Anderlecht's supporters who came differently than with RSCA's cars
The French police decided to lay down strict rules concerning the meeting of Anderlecht's Royal Sporting Club against the Paris Saint-Germain set Tuesday, Marie Verbeke, spokesperson for the police area Brussels-midday, Friday.
Belgian supporters of the RSCA who wish to visit this meeting of the Champions League will have to use the travel system established by the RSCA.
"The bus convoy will be escorted by the police from a former border post in Rekem to the PSG stage," the spokesman said.
The course will be the same for the return.
"If other supporters intended to travel to Paris by other means, the French police prefectures indicated that measures had been taken to carry out arrests or even guards in sight," said Marie Verbeke.
Living together in French, the challenge of the school commission Marguerite-Bourgeoys
At the school commission Marguerite-Bourgeoys, 62% of students have a mother tongue other than French.
This is what motivated, a year ago, a consultation with parents, students, teachers and educational staff, to reflect on ways to better integrate students who live on horseback between different cultures.
The school commission has just unveiled its vision of "Living together in French".
The Vision Diversity organization has been walking for a year in schools to help students of all backgrounds discover common landmarks that are not limited to the French language.
The discovery of neighborhoods, our architecture, our places are landmarks.
Great names of writers, artists, whether they are of strain or they have come from elsewhere.
Who are our builders?
"So we create projects so that they identify themselves with all this," explains Vision Diversity President Aida Kamar.
Michel Venne, of the Institute of the New World, identified several challenges for the school commission.
"On the transmission, for example, of what Quebec culture is, the feeling of belonging, support to staff in the transformations that we are experiencing, within the student clientele," he said.
The school commission Marguerite-Bourgeoys has created a research centre that will provide tools to teachers who also sometimes come from elsewhere.
Rachida Azduz, from the University of Montreal, will be the Scientific Director.
Preparation to manage a class in a North American context, Quebec.
"Different teaching strategies, that's the real need," she sums up.
Research will focus on inclusion at all levels: language, school, social and cultural.
