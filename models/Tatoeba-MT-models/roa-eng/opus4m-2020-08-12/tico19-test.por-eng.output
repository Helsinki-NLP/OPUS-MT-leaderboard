Cumulative rapidly progressive incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows similar trends in the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, confirming that, although it is at a different stage depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is moving rapidly across all countries.
Based on Italy's experience, countries, hospitals and ICUs should prepare more for an outbreak of patients with ICDOC-19 who will need care and, above all, intensive treatment.
On 31 December 2019, a portion of cases of unknown etiology pneumonia were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of China informed the causing agent as a new coronavirus, now referred to as coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronary artery disease (COVID-19).
The evidence so far is that 80% of people with COVID-19 develop a mild form of the disease, i.e., an infection of the respiratory tract with or without pneumonia, and most of them recover.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 evolves into a more serious disease, requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% of cases evolve into a critical disease, requiring intensive treatment.
Mortality of hospitalized patients due to VOCID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we evaluated trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each country of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and in the United Kingdom and compared them with those of Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom with that of Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
After China, the COVID-19 spread geographically, and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world currently follow that country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic.
The Eurosurveillance 2020 edition of 5 March, Spiteri et al. reported the first cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Europe, according to the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in persons returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases had already been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom, and between 31 December 2019 and the date mentioned above, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths had been reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths only in Italy.
Obtaining cumulative numbers and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of notified cases of COVID-19 in each country in the world, obtained only from official sources, such as the Ministry of Health of the countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO, is updated daily at 8:00.
These data were used to assess the trends of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, and to compare them with those of Italy.
As an approximation of the prevalence of active cases of COVID-19, we calculated the cumulative truncated incidence of 14 days of cases of COVID-19, taking into account, therefore, the natural evolution of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA country and in the United Kingdom, during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also presented the cumulative number of notified cases in each country by 15 March 2020 at 8h, and compared with that in Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
Trends in the cumulative truncated incidence of 14 days of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom, in general, followed those of Hubei Province, China (Figure 1).
In general, for the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase by around 21 February and then significantly increased by 28 February 2020 (additional material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in reported cases in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom showed similar growth trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (additional material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom compared to Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It points out that, by 15 March at 8h, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom had already reported a total number of cases comparable to those of Italy 3 weeks or less.
Our results indicate that the number of notified cases of COVID-19 is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
Trends observed in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is progressing at a similar rate in all countries.
This occurs despite the fact that countries are in different stages, variations in the actions of national public health systems and possibly different definitions of cases in countries and different protocols for the selection of patients that should be tested for confirmation of COVID-19, including testing for updating.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy described a situation in which 10% of patients with COVID-19 needed intensive treatment, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive treatment units in those regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on hospitalization for cases of COVID-19 in a hospital and/or ICU are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases respectively (data not shown).
However, they should be collected in a systematic way to complement current surveillance data focusing on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study conducted between 2010 and 2011 showed a huge variation in the availability of ICU beds and semi-intensive units in Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal for every 100,000 people.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 ICU beds and semi-intensive treatment for a population of 100,000 inhabitants between 2010 and 2011).
Modelled scenarios related to saturation of the health system capacity, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and for the United Kingdom of the prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalization cases associated with a risk greater than 90% of intensive treatment beds capacity, are provided in the sixth update of ECDC's rapid risk assessment on COVID-19.
In view of the fact that cases have so far been concentrated in certain regions of the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, and hospitals and intensive treatment units generally serve a defined population of regional scope, information on cases and intensive treatment beds should be made available preferably in the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistical Purposes 2 (NUTS-2).
The example of Italy and trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
Countries, hospitals and ICUs should therefore be prepared for a sustained community transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 and for an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 who will need medical care, mainly intensive treatment, such as in the affected regions of Italy.
As highlighted in the rapid risk assessment of ECDC, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a change in the containment approach to a mitigation approach, since the rapid increase in the number of cases may not provide sufficient time for decision-makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their actions properly, if not implemented in advance.
Rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the epidemic.
There is a small window of opportunity during which countries have the possibility to intensify their control initiatives to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure in the health system.
If these initiatives fail, health systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to have an outbreak of patients who will need intensive treatment in the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) epidemic, caused by the 2 Coronavirus Disease (SARS-CoV-2) of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), has already killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 in China and the rest of the world, resulting in a catastrophe to the population.
Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could also be transmitted from bats and causes similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has lower severity and mortality than SARS, but it is much more communicative, and affects older people more than young people, and more men than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on the new disease, this article seeks to provide a current and comprehensive assessment of the research object, which develops quickly.
We will address the basic principles of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and disease prevention.
Although many questions still need answers, we hope that this study will help to understand and eradicate this hostile disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 became a unique and unforgettable memory for all Chinese who were forced to be confined to the entire holiday and for several weeks thereafter due to the epidemic of a new viral disease.
The virus is very similar to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, it was called SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and its disease was called CoV-19 disease (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and spread rapidly throughout the country and almost 50 other countries around the world.
By March 2, 2020, the virus had resulted in more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 recovered patients and more than 3,000 dead patients.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is the "public enemy number one", and is potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 articles were published on COVID-19, including its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on 7 January 2020, which determined the sequencing of the isolated virus of several patients.
This article seeks to summarize the progress of research in this new area of rapid development.
Whenever relevant, we will compare COVID-19 to SARS and the other disease caused by CoV, the respiratory syndrome of the Middle East (MERS, a 2012 epidemic).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far about the prevention and prognosis of the disease, as well as other urgent issues.
CoVs are traditionally considered nonlethal pathogens to humans, mainly causing about 15% of the common colds.
However, in this century, we found twice highly pathogenic human coVs, which are SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, causing an epidemic originating in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and which soon spread to several other countries with frightening morbidity and mortality.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third epidemic of CoV in the documented history of the human being.
As shown in Fig. Fig.1, a portion of cases of pneumonia with unknown origins were initially reported in Wuhan on 31 December 2019 to the National Health Commission of China.
Seven days later, the CoV sequence was published.
On 15 January 2020, Wuhan’s first fatal case was reported.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to neighboring cities, provinces and countries.
On January 20, the contagion of health professionals was reported, suggesting that transmission between people was possible.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan was confined, with all its public transport interrupted.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on the disease reported that 41 patients with confirmed cases only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan Sea fruit market, which was considered the site of onset of the contagion by an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, WHO declared the epidemic a global health emergency.
Until now, the disease has spread to China and almost 50 other countries around the world (Fig. (Fig.2).
Since the situation is getting worse rapidly, the final dimension and severity of the epidemic should still be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a study of several centers with 8,866 patients, including 4,021 patients confirmed with COVID-19, presented a more up-to-date illustration of the epidemic, as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, mainly in the age range of 30 to 65 years.
Almost half (47.7%) of those infected were over 50 years of age, some were under 20 years of age, and only 14 were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
The COVID-19 spread into groups, mainly in Hubei and its surroundings.
COVID-19 received an average of 5 (2 to 9) days for diagnosis based on the onset of symptoms.
The mean incubation period was 4.8 (2.0 to 7.2) days.
The mean time of death based on the onset of symptoms was 9.5 (4.8 to 13) days.
The basic number of reproduction (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51 to 4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23 to 4.82.
The number of infected people grew exponentially before January 23, 2020, corresponding to the mass transport time before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10% to 1.86%), and the adjusted mortality of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02% to 4.59%).
The three main risk factors for VOCID-19 are gender (male), age (over 60 years) and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a large and encapsulated subfamily of viruses that contain a single chain of RNA with a certain meaning.
They can be divided into four genera, namely: alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which it is known that alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses infect humans.
The glycoprotein spike (S) of the envelope binds to its cell receptors of the angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ECA2) and dipeptidyl peptide 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and thereafter the membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released in the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA accompanied by encapsulated glycoproteins and nucleocapside proteins form vesicles containing virions, which join the plasma membrane and release the virus.
The first sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 genome was reported on 10 January 2020.
It was found that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of betacoronavirus with more than 99.98% genetic identity among 10 sequential samples collected from the same original site of the outbreak, the Huhanan Sea Fruit Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Through the electronic transmission microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles were discovered in ultrafine sections of the human airway epithelium.
It was discovered that human ECA2 is a receiver for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds to human protein ECA2 in a weaker way than SARS-CoV protein, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a less serious infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein coded by orf3b and a secreted protein coded by orf8.
Orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 may perform a function in viral pathogenicity and inhibit IFNβ expression; however, orf8 does not contain any known domain or functional reason.
On 18 February 2020 Zhou, et al., reported the cryo-EM structure of the human ECA2 of total length to resolution of 2.9 Å in a complex with the transporter of amino acids B0AT1.
It was found that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was grouped as a dimer, and the complex ECA2-B0AT1 can combine two S proteins, which provides evidence for the recognition and infection with CoV.
B0AT1 can become a therapeutic target for the screening of medicines to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The host of origin and the intermediary
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats and were transmitted to humans through civets and camels, respectively.
Through a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats were considered the native hosts of SARS-CoV-2, since the new virus is 96% identical to two CoVs of bats similar to SARS called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host who helped the virus cross the barriers of the species and infect humans remains unknown, and the transmission route still needs to be discovered.
Ji, et al., suggests that snakes carry the bat virus to humans, which involved a homologous recombination in protein S.
According to one study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggested that pangolins, long-frozen mammals that feed on ants and are frequently used in traditional Chinese medicine, are the potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2, based on the genetic homology of 99% between a CoV discovered in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a 1% difference in two genomes is a great difference; therefore, conclusive results for concrete tests are being expected (Fig. 33).
The physico-chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are largely still unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in dry environment and up to 5 days below 20 °C with moisture of 40% to 50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It was reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and to the heat of 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol 75%, disinfectant with chlorine, peracetic acid, chloroform and other organic solvents, but not chlorhexidine, are efficient in deactivation of the virus.
In general, the entire human population has no immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to the new virus.
Currently, no detailed study has been reported in relation to the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only consult previous studies on other CoVs, mainly on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. (Fig.4).4).
In general, after a virus invades the host, it is first recognized by the host's innate immune system by means of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including type C lectin receptors, type Toll receptor (TLR), type NOD receptor (NLR) and type RIG-I receptor (RLR).
Through different routes, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs), which limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the phagocytosis of macrophages of viral antigens.
However, SARS-CoV N protein can help the virus escape immune responses.
Within a short time, the adaptive immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8+ T cells directly kill virus-infected cells.
Collaborative T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to help in the defense of cells.
However, CoV can inhibit T cell functions by inducing T cell apoptosis.
Humoral immunity, including supplements such as antibodies C3a and C5a, is also essential for combating viral infection.
For example, isolated antibodies from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an exacerbated reaction of the immune system generates a large number of free local radicals that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs and, at worst, multiple organ failure, and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by the onset of symptoms in a group of people, affects more elderly people with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is common for people exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune system is compromised to have a greater chance of being infected than other people.
The estimated mean incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1 to 14 days and, most of the time, 3 to 7 days, based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases shows that the incubation period was 3 days, on average, ranging from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, shows that the incubation period was 4.8 (2.0 to 7.2) days, based on demographics of 8,866 cases.
It is essential that health authorities adjust the actual quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period, thus preventing infected people who do not have symptoms from transmitting the virus to other people.
As a common practice, individuals exposed to the virus or infected by it usually need to stay quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine period be extended for 24 days?
Fever is usually the initial and main symptom of COVID-19, which can come alone or accompanied by other symptoms, such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, throat pain, corriza, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients had dyspnea and/or hypoxemia one week after the symptoms of the disease appeared.
In severe cases, patients rapidly evolved into acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and acute fever, even without abnormalities in lung imaging diagnosis, should go through screening for the virus in order to receive an early diagnosis.
A demographic study at the end of December 2019 showed that the percentages of symptoms were 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnea and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients needed ventilatory support.
Similar results were reported in two recent studies of a family grouping and a group with transmission of an asymptomatic individual.
In comparison, a demographic study in 2012 showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnea (55%) as main symptoms.
However, 80% of the patients needed ventilatory support, much more than the COVID-19 patients, which consists of the higher mortality of MERS compared to the COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and throat pain (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
In patients with SARS, fever (99% to 100%), dry cough (29% to 75%), dyspnea (40% to 42%), diarrhoea (20% to 35%) and throat pain (13% to 35%) were the main symptoms, and ventilatory support was needed for approximately 14% to 20% of patients.
By 14 February, the mortality rate of COVID-19 was 2%, when the confirmed cases worldwide reached 66.576.
Comparably, SARS mortality until November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on a demographic study of June 2012, the mortality rate was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
A more recent study reported that the basic reproduction number R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was up to 6.47 with a confidence interval (CI) of 95%, 5.71 to 7.23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV ranged from 2 to 4, only.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV with regard to its symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The figures above suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater propagation capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less lethal than the latter two.
Therefore, it is a much greater challenge to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than that of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The appearance of symptoms in a group of people usually occurs in the same family or in the same agglomeration or vehicle, as a cruise ship.
Patients generally have history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other affected areas, or contact with infected individuals or patients in the two weeks prior to the onset of symptoms.
However, it has been reported that people may carry the virus for more than two weeks without symptoms, and cured patients who have been discharged from hospitals may contract the virus again, which generates an alarm to extend the quarantine time.
Patients present a normal or reduced number of white peripheral blood cells (mainly lymphocytes) at the initial stage.
For example, lymphopenia with white blood cell count below 4 x 109/L including lymphocyte count less than 1 x 109/L, and high levels of aspartate aminotransferase and viremia were detected in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
The levels of enzymes and myoglobins in the muscles and liver were increased in the blood of some patients, and C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation were increased in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the dimer-D level, a product of fibrin degradation present in the blood, was elevated, and lymphocyte count showed progressive reduction.
Abnormalities in chest X-ray are present in most patients with COVID-19, and present irregular shadows bilateral or opacity in dark glass in the lungs.
Patients generally developed atypical pneumonia, acute lung damage and acute respiratory distress syndrome (RASD).
When RADS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis seriously compromise the exchange of gases.
The dysfunction of type-I and type-II pneumocytes decreases the surfactant level and increases the surface tension, thus reducing the capacity of the lungs to expand, and increasing the risk of pulmonary collapse.
Therefore, the most serious results of chest X-ray generally correspond to the most severe form of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the dissection of pneumotics, the formation of the hyaline membrane, the infiltration of interstitial lymphocytes and sincitial cells into the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, consistent with the pathology of viral infection and ARDS, and similar to the pathology of patients with SARS and MERS.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA through polymerase chain reaction – reverse transcriptase (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which can accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which was not only derived from RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation also occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of the history of the disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological results is essential and indispensable to arrive at an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the group Feng Zhang described a protocol for the use of the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic RNA fragments of SARS-CoV-2 in 20 x 10-18 mol/L to 200 x 10-18 mol/L (10 to 100 copies per microlitre input) using a measuring rod in less than one hour, without the need for a complex instrumentation.
We hope that the new technique can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience, if verified in clinical samples.
Due to the lack of experience with the new CoV, physicians can provide, to the best of their ability, palliative treatment for COVID-19 patients, while attempting a variety of therapies that were used or proposed previously for the treatment of other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include current and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma of cured patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Even the plasma of patients who recovered was suggested as treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are running against time to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 attacks mainly the lungs at the beginning and probably also attacks, to a lesser degree, other organs with ECA2 expression, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
However, respiratory dysfunction and organ failure are the main threats to patients and the main causes of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives, and includes general oxygenation therapy, high flow oxygenation, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need to receive extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified cardiopulmonary alternative technique used to treat severe heart failure or respiratory failure.
In addition, the maintenance of electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, and the protection of vital organ functions are also essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It is known that cytokine cascade results from the exacerbated immune system reaction in patients with SARS and MERS.
Cytocin cascade is a systemic inflammatory response, characterized by the release of a series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNβ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune system cells to release a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of SDRA and multiple organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine cascades, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, are being used to treat cytokine cascade.
Other immunosuppression treatments for cytokine cascade include modulation of immune response directed to T cells; blockage of IFN-y, IL-1 and TNF; inhibition of JAK, blinatumomab; suppressor of cytokine signaling 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as immunosuppressants, were widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, steroids at high doses were not beneficial for severe lung injury in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
They can cause severe side effects, mainly avascular osteonecrosis, drastically affecting the prognosis.
However, short periods of treatment with corticosteroids at low to moderate doses were recommended for careful use in patients with severely ill VOCID-19.
At the time this article is written, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, it was found that intravenous administration with redesivir, an analogue of nucleotide, was effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
Redesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead, initially intended for the treatment of diseases caused by the Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, redesivir also demonstrated a possible inhibition of other single-tape RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on this, Gilead provided the compound for China to perform some tests in individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are being very expected.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin were suggested as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other drugs used in patients should be monitored carefully.
Plasma of cured patients and antibody generation
The blood collection of patients who have cured themselves from a contagious disease to treat other patients suffering from the same disease, or to protect healthy individuals from disease contraction has a long history.
In fact, patients cured usually have a relatively high level of antibodies to the blood against the pathogen.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (lg) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign bodies, and they recognize unique molecules in the pathogens and neutralize them directly.
Based on this, the plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who were cured from the COVID-19, and was injected into 10 patients in severe condition.
Her symptoms improved in 24 hours, with reduced inflammation and viral loads, and improved oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and elucidation are necessary in order to propose the use of the large-scale method before the development of specific therapies.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some plasma-associated disadvantages should be considered cautiously.
For example, antibodies may overstimulate immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is potentially fatal toxicity.
The blood antibody concentration is usually low, and plasma demand is large to treat patients in severe condition.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies with sufficient speed to combat an epidemic of global proportions.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from cured patients and identify genetic codes that encode effective antibodies or make an effective antibody screening against essential virus proteins.
Thus, we can rapidly increase the production of antibodies.
Traditional Chinese Medicine, MTC, has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of diseases in China.
However, its effects depend heavily on a combination of multiple components in a formula that varies depending on the diagnosis of a disease based on TCM theories.
Most effective components remain unknown, or it is vague, since it is difficult to extract and verify these components or their optimal combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of specific and effective therapies for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild or moderate symptoms, or for patients who have recovered from severe stages of the disease.
For example, it was found that Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules are effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
The best cure rates for patients with COVID-19 were observed in several provinces in China that used TCM in 87% of patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei Province, which used TCM in only about 30% of patients with COVID-19, obtained the lowest cure rate (13%).
However, this is a difficult comparison, since many impact factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of the disease, should be included in the evaluation.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a comparative study between the exclusive treatment with Western medicine and the combined treatment of Western medicine with TCM.
It was found that the time required for the recovery of body temperature, for the disappearance of symptoms and hospitalization were considerably lower in the group treated by western medicine and by TCM than only in the group treated by western medicine.
The rate of worsening of symptoms (from mild to severe) was considerably lower for the group treated by Western medicine and TCM than for the group treated only by Western medicine (7.4% versus 46.2%), and mortality was lower in the group treated by Western medicine and TCM than in the group treated only by Western medicine (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the effectiveness and safety of the MTC still await more properly controlled tests at larger scales and in more centers.
It would also be useful to characterize the action mechanisms and explain the effective components of TCM treatments or their combinations, if possible.
Patients confirmed with COVID-19 or suspected of the disease generally feel a great fear of the highly contagious and potentially fatal disease, and people in quarantine also feel bored, lonely and irritated.
Moreover, symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatments, such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, can increase anxiety and psychological suffering.
In the initial phase of the SARS epidemic, several psychiatric disorders, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitation, symptoms of psychosis, delusion and even suicidal tendencies were reported.
The tracking of contacts and mandatory quarantine, as part of the actions of the public health system against the COVID-19 epidemic, can make people more anxious, and they may feel guilty about the effects of the contagion, quarantine, and stigma imposed on their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to patients with COVID-19, to people with suspicion of the disease and to those who had contact with them, as well as to the population in general, who need it.
Psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and on treatment plans, and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid direct contact between people.
Effective vaccines are essential to interrupt the transmission chain of animal reservoirs and infected people to susceptible hosts, and are generally complementary to antiviral treatment in the control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Initiatives were taken to develop protein-based S vaccines to generate potent and durable neutralizing antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Vaccines were evaluated in animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these vaccine candidates in older individuals and lethal challenge models and their protection against zoonotic virus infection still need to be determined before a clinical study begins.
This is probably due to the fact that SARS disappeared 17 years ago and no new case has been reported since then.
On the other hand, sporadic cases and MERS focal points continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies were developed for MERS using inactive viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune individuals is an urgent and essential task for controlling the current epidemic.
However, it is a challenge to overcome the difficulty due to the long period (18 months, on average) necessary for the development of a vaccine and variations in the dynamics of CoVs.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to manifest its complete clinical evolution, reaching thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients gradually recover without sequelae.
However, in the same way as SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, building a prognosis model for the disease is essential for health agencies to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on the clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (Table33):
Age: age was the most important factor for the prognosis of SARS, which also applies to the COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects people between 30 and 65 years of age, with 47.7% of patients over 50 years of age, in a study of 8,866 cases, as described above.
Patients who needed intensive treatment were more likely to present underlying comorbidities and complications, and were significantly older than patients who did not need intensive treatment (mean age of 66 versus 51 years), suggesting that age is a prognostic factor for the health outcome of patients with COVID-19.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 men and 0.27/100,000 women), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: patients with COVID-19 who need intensive treatment are more likely to suffer from acute heart injury or arrhythmia.
Heart episodes were the main cause of death in patients with SARS.
It was reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also join positive ECA2 colangiocytes, which can lead to hepatic dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It is important to note that age and underlying diseases have strong correlation and may interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: the level of C-reactive protein (CPR) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and was proposed as a potential prognosis factor for the disease, response to therapy and final recovery.
The correlation of CRP level with the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 was also proposed.
In addition, high lactate hydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) may also assist in predicting the outcome.
These enzymes are present expressively in several organs, mainly in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Therefore, they are traditional markers for cardiac or hepatic dysfunction.
Key clinical symptoms: chest X-ray and temporal progression of clinical symptoms should be considered together with other questions for predicting outcomes/complications of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants normally used as an attachment therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Given that high corticosteroid dosage was widely used in patients with severe SARS, many survivors suffered from avascular osteonecrosis, with permanent incapacity and low quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used in a low dose and for a short period in patients with COVID-19.
Psychological stress: as described above, during the COVID-19 epidemic, many patients suffer from high stress, since they go through long periods of quarantine and uncertainties, and witness the death of loved members of the family and other patients.
It is essential to provide psychological advice and lasting support to help these patients recover from stress and resume a normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics of SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 manages to replicate efficiently in the upper respiratory tract and does not cause symptoms at the initial stage of infection (or causes only mild symptoms), similar to other CoVs that cause common colds.
Therefore, patients infected at the initial stage or incubation period can produce a large amount of virus during their daily activities, causing great difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, it was considered that transmission of SARS-CoV occurs when patients are seriously ill, with most transmissions not occurring in the initial phase.
Therefore, the current epidemic of COVID-19 is much more serious and difficult to control than the epidemic of SARS.
Great efforts are currently being made in China, including the confinement of Wuhan and neighboring cities, and the continued quarantine of almost the entire population, in hopes of interrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these actions have drastically affected the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing, indicating the remission of the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the epidemic ends until March, and the deceleration phase lasts between 3 and 4 months.
However, other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimated that COVID-19, which appears to be substantially more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., established a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 may infect two thirds of the world's population.
One Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the throat rubble and the mean cornet of patients who recovered and were discharged from the hospital in the previous 2 weeks, indicating that the new identified virus may become a influenza-like cyclical episode.
However, promising evidence occurred in China based on the decline in the number of new cases, indicating that current strategies could be working.
It was originally predicted that Ebola would cause up to one million cases, with half a million deaths.
However, with quarantine and rigid isolation, the disease was maintained under control at last.
It is possible that SARS-CoV-2, in the same way as SARS-CoV, may become weaker as to its infectivity and, at some point, become a less pathogenic virus co-existing with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS epidemic is below (Fig. (Fig.55)).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmitted by cough and sneezing and, possibly, by direct contact with materials contaminated by the virus.
The virus was also found in faeces, which generates a new possibility: that of oral-fetal transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases were possibly caused by nosocomial infections, including 17 patients with underlying diseases and 40 health professionals.
Therefore, greater caution should be taken to protect people, especially health professionals, social workers, family members, colleagues and people with direct contact with infected patients or individuals.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is the use of facial masks; the use of surgical masks and respiratory masks N95 (Series No. 1860s) helps control the spread of the virus.
Surgical facial masks prevent fluid droplets of a potentially infected individual from being transported in the air or attached to the surfaces of the objects, where they can infect other people.
However, only the masks N95 (Series No. 1860s) protect against inhalation of virions with a size of 10 nm to 80 nm, with only 5% of the viruses being able to penetrate it completely; the SARS-CoV-2 is similar to the SARS-CoV in size, and the two have approximately 85 nm.
Since the particles can penetrate up to five surgical masks together, health professionals in direct contact with patients should use the N95 masks (series no. 1860s), but not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health professionals should use insulation clothing to further reduce contact with the virus.
Viruses also infect an individual through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected by SARS-CoV-2, although he was wearing an N95 mask; the virus could have entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, health professionals should also use transparent facial protectors or protective glasses when caring for patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is highly recommended that everyone wash their hands with disinfectant soap more frequently than normal, try to stay at home in isolation and limit contact with potentially infected people.
A meter is considered an appropriate distance to stay away from a patient.
These actions are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection, as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 emerged as a new virus for humans, its high homology to SARS-CoV, as reported on 7 January 2020, should have caused a great alert to China, based on its recent history with the SARS epidemic in 2003.
However, only on 19 January 2020 the director of the Wuhan Disease Control Centre reassured the citizens, saying that the new virus has a low rate of limited contagion and reproduction among humans, and that it was not difficult to prevent and contain the disease.
This message left people more relaxed, especially when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical period for the containment of the disease in Wuhan on a minimum scale was lost.
Disease control agencies in China can take advantage of this hard lesson and make crucial improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should: (1) be more cautious when making public statements, since everything they say is absorbed by the citizens and can influence their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to unusual information from hospitals rather than waiting for formal communications from doctors and authorities; (3) be more restrictive to contain a potential epidemic at its initial stage rather than trying to comfort the public; and (4) issue more frequently targeted and effective simulations to increase public awareness of epidemic diseases and test and improve society's response system periodically.
The COVID-19 epidemic caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, it spread throughout China and almost 50 other countries around the world at the time of writing this text.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV, and the symptoms are also similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 epidemic generated a feeling of SARS return.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for the containment of the epidemic and the treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people, and more men than women, and the severity and mortality rate are also higher in older people than in young people.
SARS has higher mortality than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 transmit the virus when they do not have symptoms, while patients with SARS usually transmit it when they are seriously ill, which generates a greater difficulty in containing the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains, in part, why SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster and affects more regions than SARS-CoV.
The regular RNA test for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, cured patients can receive a positive test for the virus again.
These results dramatically increase the risk of spread of the virus.
Given the rapid progress in research on COVID-19, several crucial issues still need to be resolved, as follows:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although a 96% genetic homologous was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two CoVs of bats similar to SARS, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats.
Which animal was the intermediate species that transmitted the virus from the original host, from the bat, say, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to questions 1 and 2, we will not be able to cut the transmission efficiently, and the epidemic may have a recurrence at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 joins ECA2, how exactly does the virus enter the respiratory tract cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also connect to cells with ECA2 expression in the other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot get a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How is the virus evolving genetically during transmission between humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, disappear like SARS or will it have seasonal recurrence, like influenza?
It is essential, but it may take some time to search for answers to the above and to so many others.
However, regardless of the efforts required, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to our normal lives.
Zoonotic origins of human coronavirus
Mutation and adaptation have spurred co-evolution of the coronavirus (CoVs) and its hosts, including human beings, for thousands of years.
Before 2003, it was known that two human CoVs (HCOVs) caused a mild disease, like a common cold.
Epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) changed what was thought of the CoVs and revealed how lethal and devastating a HCOV infection can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 highlighted the CoVS again and surprised everyone with its high transmissibility and reduced pathogenicity compared to their brother SARS-CoV.
HCOV infection is zoonotic, and understanding the zoonotic origins of HCOVs is extremely useful.
Most HCOVs originated from bats, in which they are non-pathogenic.
The intermediate reservoir hosts of some HCOVs are also known.
The identification of animal hosts has direct implications for the prevention of diseases in humans.
The investigation of the interactions of the CoV host in animals can also provide important information on the pathogenesis of CoV in humans.
In this study, we present an overview of the existing information about the seven HCOVs, with a focus on the history of its discovery, as well as its zoonotic origins and interspecies transmission.
An important analysis is that we make a comparison and contrast between different HCOVs from a perspective of the evolution of the virus and the recombination of the genome.
The current epidemic of the disease by CoV 2019 (COVID-19) is discussed in this context.
Moreover, the requirements for effective transition between hosts and the implications of the evolution of the virus in the severity of the disease are also highlighted.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the Coronaviridae family, which includes a group of encapsulated viruses, of positive polarity and simple tape RNA.
These viruses that present the largest genome, between 26 and 32 kilobases, between RNA viruses were called "CoVs" due to their crown morphology when observed in electronic microscope.
As for the structure, the CoVs have unsegregated genomes that share a similar organization.
Approximately two thirds of the genome contain two overlayed open reading structures (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into pp1a and pp1ab replication polyproteins.
Polyproteins are transformed again and generate 16 non-structural proteins, called nsp1 to nsp16.
The remaining portion of the genome contains ORFs for structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
Some specific line accessory proteins are also encoded by different CoVs strains.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genera (alphaCoV, betaCoV, gammaCoV and deltaCoV), among which the genus betaCoV contains most HCOVs and is subdivided into four strains (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence showed that bats and rodents serve as genetic source for most alphaCoVs and betaCoVs, while birds are the main reservoir of gammaCoVs and deltaCoVs.
For thousands of years, the CoVs have constantly crossed the barriers of the species, and some have become relevant human pathogens.
So far, seven human CoVs (HCOVs) are known.
Among them, HCOV-229E and HCOV-NL63 are alphaCoVs.
The other five betaCoVs include HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), the coronavirus of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63 viruses usually cause mild symptoms, such as a common cold and/or diarrhoea.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic and cause severe lower respiratory tract infection in a relatively larger number of patients, with a high chance of developing acute respiratory discomfort syndrome (RASD) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first strain of HCOV-229E, B814, was isolated from the corriza of patients with common cold in the mid 1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been accumulated through comprehensive studies on HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43, and both cause self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, the concept that HCOV infection is generally harmless was widely accepted until the SARS epidemic.
The SARS epidemic that occurred in 2003 is one of the most devastating of today and has infected more than 8,000 people, with a gross mortality rate related to confirmed cases of approximately 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) epidemic resulted in a persistent epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula, with sporadic spread to the rest of the world.
The new 2019 HCOV (2019-nCoV), which was later renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the cause agent of the current 2019 coronary disease epidemic (COVID-19), which took more than 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people until March 3, 2020.
The alarm is ringing, and the world needs to prepare for the pandemic of the incoming SARS-CoV-2.
All seven HCOVs have zoonotic origin in bats, mice or domestic animals.
Multiple lines of evidence corroborate the evolutionary origin of all HCOVs from bats, where viruses are well adapted and not pathogenic, but demonstrate great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic presents huge medical, scientific, social and moral challenges for China and the rest of the world.
The tracking of the zoonotic origins of HCOVs provides a structure to understand the natural history, the driving force and the restrictive factors of virus migration to other species.
This can also guide and facilitate the search for reservoir, intermediate and amplifier hosts of SARS-CoV-2, with important implications for the future prevention of viral migration among species.
In this article, we present an overview of zoonotic origins, interspecies transmission and pathogenesis of HCOVs.
In particular, we highlighted and discussed the common theme that the parental viruses of HCOVs are generally non-pathogenic in their natural reservoir hosts, but become pathogenic after the interspecies transmission to a new host.
We also reviewed the trend of evolution of HCOV, in which increased transmissibility is usually accompanied by decreased pathogenicity.
The outcome of the current SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is also discussed in this context.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the first isolate of strain B814 from HCOV-229E from the corriza of patients who contracted common cold, different CoVs had been isolated in several infected animals, including turkey, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
Seven HCOVs have been identified in recent decades.
A brief summary of the history of the discovery of HCOV in chronological order (Table 1) would be informative and informative.
The first strain of HCOV-229E was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, and was subsequently adapted to growth in pulmonary cell strains WI-38.
Patients infected with HCOV-229E had common cold symptoms, including headache, sneezing, malaise and throat pain, with fever and cough present in 10% to 20% of cases.
Subsequently, in 1967, HCOV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and subsequent serial passage into mice' brains during lactation.
The clinical characteristics of HCOV-OC43 infection seem similar to those caused by HCOV-229E, which are symptomatically indistinguishable from infection by other respiratory tract pathogens such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43 are distributed globally, and tend to be transmitted predominantly during the winter season in temperate climates.
In general, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than one week, accompanied by the disease for approximately 2 weeks.
According to a study with human volunteers, healthy individuals infected with HCOV-229E developed a common soft cold.
Only some immunocompromised patients exhibited severe lower respiratory tract infection.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", was the first documented pandemic caused by HCOV in human history, and the etiologic agent is SARS-CoV, the third HCOV discovered.
The first case of SARS dates back to 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 reported cases of 774 deaths, spreading across several countries and continents.
With the exception of "super-spatchers", it was estimated that each contaminated person may contaminate approximately two others, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days, and with the appearance of the peak viral load on the tenth day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially have myalgia, headache, fever, malaise and chills, followed by subsequent symptoms of dyspnea, cough and respiratory discomfort.
Lymphopenia, hepatic dysfunction and high creatine kinase are the common abnormalities of SARS in laboratory tests.
Diffuse alveolar damage, epithelial cell proliferation and increased number of macrophages are also observed in patients with SARS.
Approximately 20% to 30% of patients at some point require intensive treatment and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs, including gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys, may also be affected in these severe cases, usually with a cytokine cascade, which may be lethal, especially in immunocompromised patients.
The virus was first isolated in a lung biopsy of a relative of the zero patient traveling from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, huge efforts have been devoted to research on HCOV.
HCOV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month baby in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
It was initially discovered that the virus was prevalent in small, elderly children and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
Symptoms of choriza, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis are common in the disease caused by HCOV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from a nasal specimen of an 8-month-old infant suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it has been identified in the Netherlands, it is scattered all over the world.
It was estimated that HCOV-NL63 corresponds to approximately 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, and its peak incidence occurs in winter, spring and early summer.
HCOV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as crupe.
In the same year, HCOV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, it was reported that HCOV-HKU1 was associated with exacerbation of acute asthma.
Like HCOV-NL63, HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 was found worldwide, causing mild respiratory diseases.
All four HCOVs acquired in a community way have adapted well to human beings and are generally less likely to suffer mutation and cause highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents have occurred for unknown reasons in the rare case of a more virulent HCOV-NL63 subtype, which has recently been reported as causing severe lower respiratory tract infection in China.
In general, when these HCOVs acquire the ability to be transmitted efficiently and continuously in humans, they also become less virulent and less pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lung of a 60-year-old patient who developed acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.
While most cases confirmed by laboratory originate in the Middle East, cases imported with occasional secondary spread to close contacts were reported in several European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary epidemic occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SARS, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also develop acute renal failure, which is therefore very peculiar to MERS, among the diseases caused by HCOV.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
Until February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 cases confirmed by laboratory were reported with a high mortality rate related to confirmed cases of 34.4%, which made MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses of human knowledge.
From half to the end of December 2019, groups of patients with pneumonia, which was retrospectively known to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization declared the continuing epidemic of lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 an Emergency of Public Health of International Importance and also named the COVID-19 disease.
Until March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases were confirmed worldwide, with a gross mortality rate related to confirmed cases of 3.4%.
It is noted that the lethality related to confirmed cases in Hubei, China, is 4.2%, while the lethality outside this city is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infection, just like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, with fever, cough and dyspnea.
Some patients also have diarrhea.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can rapidly evolve into acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to high homology of 82% in the nucleotide sequence, they are grouped into different branches in the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but is more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, and they can contribute to the rapid spread of the virus around the world.
The comparison and contrast of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCOVs reveal similarities and differences of great relevance.
First, the incubation period and the duration of the evolution of HCOV disease are very similar.
In this sense, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCOVs.
Secondly, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 is between the severity of SARS-CoV and the severity of the four HCOVs acquired in a Community way (HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection has characteristics that are most observed during community-acquired HCOV infection, including the presence of non-specific, mild or no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subgroup of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be observed, as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Thirdly, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns, both in the HCOVs acquired in a community way and in the SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of HCOVs acquired in the community.
On the other hand, it should be confirmed whether the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after passing on to humans, as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, in the same way as the other HCOVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in faecal samples.
It still needs to be clarified in future studies if the oro-fecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role, as in the case of SARS-CoV, at least in some circumstances.
It is also of great interest to discover whether SARS-CoV-2 can display seasonality, as in the case of HCOVs acquired in a community way.
In any case, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable propagation after its passage to humans, will influence the outcome of the current COVID-19 epidemic.
All Community-acquired HCOVs that cause mild symptoms have adapted well to human beings.
From another perspective, it can also be true that humans have adapted well to these four HCOVs.
In other words, the two could be the survivors of ancient HCOV pandemics.
HCOVs that cause serious diseases in humans and people who develop serious HCOVs diseases have been eliminated.
For this to happen, HCOVs need to replicate themselves in humans to a sufficient extent in order to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that neutralize restriction factors.
In this sense, the longer the remaining time of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, the more people will be infected, and the greater the chance that the virus will adapt to human beings.
If adaptation is appropriate, transmission to human beings would be difficult to control with quarantine or other infection control measures.
Several years ago, the four CoVs acquired in a community way circulated in human populations, causing common cold in immunocompetent individuals.
These viruses don't need an animal reservoir.
On the other hand, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted well to human beings, and their transmission among human beings cannot be sustained.
They need to stay and spread in their zoonotic reservoirs and take advantage of the chance to migrate to susceptible human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the four HCOVs acquired in a Community way.
It is highly communicable, in the same way as HCOVs acquired in a Community way, at least so far.
However, it is more pathogenic than HCOVs acquired in a community and less pathogenic way than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
It still needs to be discovered whether it will fully adapt to human beings and circulate among us without a reservoir or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCOVs, it would be useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary hosts, natural, reservoirs, intermediates and amplifiers of HCOVs.
An animal serves as the evolutionary host of a HCOV if it houses an ancestor of direct relationship, sharing high homology at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
The ancestral virus is usually well adapted and not pathogenic in this host.
Similarly, a reservoir host hosts HCOV in a continuous and lasting way.
In both cases, hosts are naturally infected and are the natural hosts of HCOV or its parenting virus.
On the other hand, if HCOV is newly introduced to an intermediate host immediately before or near its introduction to humans, it does not adapt properly to the new host, and is generally pathogenic.
This intermediate host can serve as the zoonotic source of human infection and perform the function of an amplifying host, allowing the virus to replicate transiently and then transmitting it to humans and increasing the scale of human infection.
A HCOV may have the infection interrupted if it cannot sustain its transmission in the intermediate host.
In contrast, HCOVs can also adapt to the intermediate host and establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes the natural reservoir host.
Epidemiological data revealed that SARS's zero patient had a history of contact with hunting animals.
Subsequent investigations of seroprevalence indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence of IgG anti-SARS-CoV, compared with that of the general population.
Masked palm civetes (Paguma larvata) and a guaxinim dog in live animal markets were initially identified as virus carriers similar to SARS-CoV.
The identification was indirectly corroborated by the fact that no other SARS was reported after the slaughter of all civets in the markets.
However, it was reported that the wild masquerade palm civets or farms without exposure to live animal markets were highly negative for SARS-CoV, suggesting that the masquerade palm civets could only be the amplifying intermediate host, but not the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
It is noted that 80% of the different animals on the markets in Guangzhou have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies; the possibility that several species of small mammals may serve as intermediate host amplifiers of SARS-CoV cannot be excluded.
All these animals appear to be terminal hosts of SARS-CoV.
The subsequent search by the natural animal host of SARS-CoV revealed a closely related bat coV, named CoV HKU3 of Rhinolophus bat related to SARS (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in the Chinese bat-ferrature.
These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and for the genomic sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
This and other bat CoVs share 88% to 92% of homology with SARS-CoV in the nucleotide sequence.
These studies formed the basis for the new concept that bats are the host of emerging human pathogens.
Several CoVs similar to SARS (SL-CoVs) were also identified in bats, but no CoV, except for the so-called WIV1, can be isolated as a live virus.
It is known that the converting enzyme angiotensin 2 (ECA2) of humans is the receptor of SARS-CoV.
It has been shown that WIV1 derived from faecal samples of bats uses ECA2 of bats, civets and human beings as a receptor for entry into cells.
It is intriguing that the serum of convalescent SARS patients was able to neutralize WIV1.
So far, the WIV1 represents the ancestral in relation to SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% homology in the nucleotide sequence.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parental virus of SARS-CoV, and that bats are not the immediate reservoir hosts of SARS-CoV.
The phylogenetic analysis group the MERS-CoV in the same group as the CoV-HKU4 of bats and the CoV-HKU5 of bats.
The bat CoV-HKU4 and the MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, dipeptidyl-peptide 4 (DPP4), for virus entry.
Polymerase sequences of RNA dependent on MERS-CoV RNA are phylogenetically closer to betaCoV counterparts identified in Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
The MERS-CoV and its closest relative, the CoV-HKU25 of bats, share only 87% of homology in the nucleotide sequence.
Therefore, bats may not be the immediate container host of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromedaries are seropositive for MERS-CoV specific neutralization antibodies, in the same way as Middle East camels in several African countries.
The living MERS-CoV, identical to the virus found in humans, was isolated from dromedary nasal rubbles, increasing the evidence that camels serve as the legitimate reservoir host of the MERS-CoV.
It is also worth noting that generally mild symptoms, but with massive transmission of the virus, were observed in camels infected experimentally with MERS-CoV.
It is noteworthy that infected camels transmit viruses not only through the respiratory route, but also through the fecal-oral route, which is also the main route of virus transmission in bats.
However, there are still no answers, since many confirmed cases of MERS have no history of contact with camels prior to the onset of symptoms, which can be attributed, plausiblely, to transmission between people or transmission routes involving unidentified animal species that shelter the MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% of nucleotide homology with a bat's RATG13 CoV, isolated from Rhinolophus finis bats.
As in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the subsequent divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is very large to assign a parental relationship.
In other words, bats may not be the immediate reservoir hosts of SARS-CoV-2, unless nearly identical coVs of bats are discovered in the future.
It is assumed that intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2 should be set up among wild species sold and slaughtered in the Janan Sea Fruit Attack Market, to which many of the initial cases of COVID-19 were associated, indicating a probable event of transmission of animals to human beings.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing suggested that a group of small mammals threatened with extinction known as pangolins (Javanica manis) could also shelter ancestral betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2.
These new genomes of pangolim coV share 85% to 92% of homology in the nucleotide sequence with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are also, in the same way, directly related to the RaTG13, with about 90% identity at the nucleotide sequence level.
They are grouped into virus-like strains like SARS-CoV-2 in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a domain of binding to the receptor (DLR) with SARS-CoV-2, with 97.4% identity following amino acids.
In a huge contrast, the DLRs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are more divergent, although they present a high degree of sequential homology throughout the genome.
A recent study on patient pangolins also reported the detection of viral consensus sequences of lung samples, which are closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted different methods of configuration and manual healing to generate a partial genomic sequence, corresponding to about 86.3% of the viral genome in total size.
We cannot rule out the possibility that pangolim is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, currently, there is no evidence that confirms the direct origin of the SARS-CoV-2 of the pangolim due to the subsequent divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2 of the pangolins.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even smaller than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2 of pangolins.
The evolutionary route of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals still needs to be clarified.
While the highest sequential homology was found in the DLRs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolim, betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest genomic sequential homology.
It is highly speculative that the high degree of similarity between betaCoVs DLRs of pangolins related to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 reflects the convergent evolution mediated by selectivity.
A contrary argument relates to the recombination between betaCoV of pangolins related to SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 in the third wild animal species.
As a driving force in evolution, recombination is quite present in betacoVs.
The immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 remains under investigation.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCOVs, the zoonotic origin of HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-HKU1 viruses was also studied.
Phylogenetic evidence indicated that both HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-229E could have originated from bat coVs, while the parental viruses of HCOV-OC43 and HCOV-HKU1 were discovered in rodents.
It was reported that a bat CoV called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) detected in the American tricolor bat presented a direct relationship with HCOV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCOV-229E was genetically related to another bat CoV, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, and there is also suspicion that the camelids are their intermediate hosts.
For greater clarity, the current knowledge about the animal origins of known HCOVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
The phylogenetic analysis provided evidence for interspecies transmission events of HCOVs throughout history.
When HCOV-OC43 crossed the species and infected human beings from domestic animals around 1890, a pandemic of respiratory infection was recorded.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCOV-229E is less clear.
AlphaCoVs of bats closely related to HCOV-229E were discovered.
Among them, there's an alphacoV of alpacas.
Several lines of evidence corroborate the direct transmission of bat virus to humans.
First, human beings, but not alpacas, may have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
On the other hand, humans have direct contact with the alpacas.
Second, bat alphaCoVs related to HCOV-229E are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, while alpacal alphaCoV caused an epidemic of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alphaCoV of alpacas was not found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility cannot be excluded that alpaces obtain from humans the alphaCoV related to HCOV-229E.
In fact, bats are the direct source of pathogenic viruses for humans, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not surprising that bats transmit HCOV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, while alphaCoVs serve as a genetic pool of HCOV-229E, alpacas and dromers can serve as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, exactly as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of the interspecies transmission of bats to dromedaries and dromedaries to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats is known in its initial identification and was corroborated by subsequent results.
It is obvious that bats provide a rich pool of viral species for interspecies exchange of genetic fragments and interspecies transmission.
Longevity, colonies with high density, close social interaction and high flight capacity are all favorable conditions for bats to be the ideal "viral propagator".
On the other hand, the introduction of the MERS-CoV into the dromedaries dates back to decades.
It is well adapted to these camels, and migrated from an intermediate host to a natural and stable reservoir host.
MERS-CoV is the cause of a very mild disease and sustains a relatively low rate of mutation in these animals.
Their sporadic transmission to human beings is an accident, and human beings remain terminal hosts of the MERS-CoV, since their transmission cannot be sustained.
In contrast to the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins, if any, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, is different.
Specifically, pangolin betaCoVs are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They may be a terminal host for betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2, similar to civets, in the case of SARS-CoV.
Several possibilities for the interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 of animals to humans need to be confirmed or discarded in future studies.
First, bats could be the reservoir host of a virus related to SARS-CoV-2, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Human beings could share the ecological niche with bats through slaughter or coal mines.
Secondly, pangolins could be one of the intermediate host amplifiers, in which a virus related to SARS-CoV-2 had been recently introduced.
Human beings contract the virus through slaughter and consumption of hunting meat.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
A research on antibodies produced by domestic and wild animals is necessary.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in a third species that has contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is still active.
In addition to the different types of animal hosts, three main factors in the virus are important in facilitating the CoVs to cross the barriers of the species.
First, its relatively high mutation rate in RNA replication.
Compared to other simple tape RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rates of CoVs can be considered from "moderate" to "high" with an average replacement rate of approximately 10-4 substitutions per year, depending on the CoV adaptation phase to new hosts.
The CoVs have exoribonicase with a review mechanism, whose exclusion results in excessively high mutability and attenuation, or even impermissibility.
It is interesting that the analogue nucleotide redesivir suppresses CoV replication by inhibiting this exoribonicase and RNA-dependent polymerase.
Redesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents tested in clinical trials.
However, CoVs mutation rates are almost one million times higher than their hosts.
Moreover, the mutation rate is usually high when CoVs are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, which has a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is low, apparently suggesting its highest level of adaptation to human beings.
Presumably, he has already adapted to another host who maintains contact with human beings.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to dromedaries.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that a genetic change would quickly render vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective.
Secondly, the large genome of the RNA in CoVs exerts an extra plasticity in the modification of the genome for mutations and recombinations, increasing therefore the probability of interspecies co-evolution, which is advantageous for the emergence of new CoVs when conditions become appropriate.
This is corroborated by the abundance of unique reading frames and coded protein functions compared to the last three inches of the genome end.
Third, CoVs exchange models randomly and frequently during RNA replication by means of a unique mechanism of "copy selection".
In a host serving as a mixing container, tape exchange occurs frequently during the transcription of the CoV RNA.
Highly homologous and subgenomic long RNAs can be combined to generate new CoVs.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination was found both in HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-OC43, as well as in animal coVs, such as bats SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
Virus-host interaction in relation to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with host receptor is another key factor that influences interspecies transmission.
Here, the recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example, which also showed evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission events.
Based on the comparative analysis between SARS-CoVs isolates of human beings and civetas, it is believed that SARS-CoV undergoes rapid adaptation in different hosts, mainly with mutations in the DLR of protein S.
In general, the DLR in the S protein of a CoV interacts with the cellular receptor and is intensely selected by the host's antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, the DLR is in amino acids 318o to 510o in S1 fragment, which binds to human ECA2 as well as its correctors for viral input.
The SARS-CoV DLR is able to recognize ECA2 receptors from various animals, including bats, civets, mice and dogs-guaxins, allowing interspecies transmission of the virus.
In fact, it was observed that only six amino acid residues were different from human viral isolates and from civets in the DLR, and four of them are located on the reason for connecting the receptor to the ECA2 receptor.
The Civeta SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations in its DLR, which could increase the affinity of protein spike interaction with the human ECA2 receptor.
In other words, these two substitutions of amino acids could be critical for viral adaptation in humans.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor with SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 protein unit implies that the affinity of its S protein to human ECA2 could have been altered.
In fact, a study with electronic cryomicroscopy indicates an affinity of 10 to 20 times greater of this connection than between human ECA2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It will also be useful to determine whether any other corrector may be necessary for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
It is intriguing that HCOV-NL63 also binds to ECA2, but with a different part of the S protein.
There are several other HCOV receptors, such as aminopeptidease N for HCOV-229E and 9-O-acetylated syálic acid for HCOV-OC43.
They could also respond by effectively adapting these CoVs into human beings after the interspecies transmission of their animal hosts.
In addition to cellular receptors, the result of interspecies transmission of HCOVs is also governed by other factors of restriction and dependency with the host.
The divergence of these host proteins between human beings and natural HCOV reservoir hosts such as bats, dromers and rodents could constitute a barrier to interspecies transmission.
HCOVs need to usurp the dependency factors with the host and subvert the host's restriction factors to an effective interspecies transmission.
In this sense, molecular determinants in this important area of the host-virus interaction still need to be identified and characterized.
A non-tendant screening with reach at host dependency genome level and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 using modern CRISPR technology can yield good results.
Emerging from new HCOVs: back to zero stake
The diversity of bat CoVs provides ample possibilities for the emergence of new HCOVs.
In this sense, bat coVs serve as a genetic pool of HCOVs.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also drive the evolution of HCOV and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein coding genes has the potential to dramatically modify viral phenotypes.
Among the accessory proteins of SARS-CoV, it is believed that ORF8 is important in its adaptation to human beings, since bat viruses related to SARS-CoV were isolated, but it was found that they encode divergent ORF8 proteins.
A characteristic of exclusion of nucleotide 29 from SARS-CoVs was discovered in isolated strains at the beginning of the human epidemic.
The exclusion divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and it is believed to be an adaptive mutation that promotes the alternation of hosts.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a possible history of recombination with alphaCoV strains and gammaCoVs, where a large number of smaller recombinant regions were identified in the RNA-dependent polymerase.
The recombination sites were also identified in nsp9, most of the nsp10 and parts of the nsp14.
Similarly, it was demonstrated that the epidemic MERS-CoV went through recombination events between different strains, which occurred in dromedaries in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events were also observed in other HCOVs, in which HCOVs are combined with other animal CoVs in their non-structural genes.
It should also be warned that artificial selection can contribute to unwanted changes in viral genomes, probably resulting from relief from the selection pressure exerted on viruses, such as host immune system pressure.
An example of these effects is the loss of a long ORF4 in the prototype strain of HCOV-229E due to the exclusion of two nucleotides.
While the ORF4 intact can be observed in bat and camel viruses related to HCOV-229E, the alphaCoV of alpacas presents a simple insertion of nucleotide, resulting in a change in the frames.
Finally, but not least, the evolution of new HCOVs is also driven by the selection pressure on its reservoir hosts.
No symptoms or only mild symptoms were detected in bats when they were infected with CoVs, indicating the mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
The bats are likely to be well adapted to the anatomical and physiological CoVs.
For example, defects in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology triggered by CoVs.
In addition, the activity of natural exterminator cells in bats is suppressed due to the adaptation of the natural exterminator cell inhibitor NKG2/CD94 and the low degree of expression of class I molecules of the main histocompatibility complex.
Moreover, the high level of reactive oxygen species (ROE) generated from high metabolic activity of bats can both suppress CoV replication and affect the review by exorribonuclease, thus providing selective pressure for the generation of highly pathogenic virus strains by being introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic strains of CoV could also evolve by recombination, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for host adaptation.
Therefore, it is not by chance that three new HCOVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic, or cause at most mild symptoms in their reservoir hosts, such as bats and camels.
They replicate immensely without causing a high host's immune response.
In this document we find the explanations about the discovery of asymptomatic carriers and the cause of serious cases in human infection.
Serious symptoms are mainly due to hyperactivity of the immune response and cytokine cascade, in which the higher the immune response, the more severe the damage to the lungs.
On the other hand, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was switched off from CoV replication.
The same immune response shutdown strategy could have beneficial effects on anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon response is specifically strong in bats.
Therefore, administration of type I interferon at the initial stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be beneficial.
In addition, activation of NLRP3 inflammation in bats is deficient.
Following this reasoning, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammation with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the same principles by which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV emerged.
While it was found that the betaCoV of bats shares 95% of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, there is a coV of bats that shares 96% of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although it has been found that civets and other animals in the markets have viruses identical to SARS-CoV, intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.
BetaCoVs of pangolins, with high homology with SARS-CoV-2, were discovered, indicating that pangolins can serve as one of the intermediate hosts, or betaCoVs of pangolins can contribute genetic fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although the questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is produced by the accidental or intentional man.
The CoVs returned to global attention due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
The study of the CoVs in bats and other animals has dramatically changed our perception of the importance of the zoonotic and animal reservoirs of HCOVs in transmission among human beings.
Evidence of widespread dissemination shows that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originate in the bat and are transmitted to people through intermediate hosts.
Since SARS-CoV infection originated from contact between human beings and civets in markets, the closure of wet markets and the slaughter of civets in these markets could have put an end to the SARS epidemic.
Following the same reasoning, pangolins should be removed from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, in the face of the discovery of multiple betacoV strains of pangolins closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, it should still be clarified in future studies if SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other mammals, and the mode of transmission.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in dromedaries for a long time.
These camels serve as an important means of transport, and are an essential source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the local community.
They are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to sacrifice all camels for the control of MERS, as was done in the markets of wild animals in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurrent epidemics of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels, in combination with other measures of infection control.
Since we have failed to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may arise and cause epidemics.
A variety of zoonotic CoVs circulate in nature.
Specifically, the CoVs of bats with zoonotic potential are very diverse.
There are several possibilities for these zoonotic CoVs to evolve and recombine, resulting in the emergence of new CoVs that are more communicable and/or lethal to humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the crisis of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better response and preparation plan should be adopted.
In fact, many viruses have been on the planet for a long time.
They stay in their natural reservoirs until there is a chance of migration to another species.
Although bats have many characteristics that favor the spread of the virus, the chance that people are in contact with bats and other wild species can be minimized if people are taught to stay away from them.
Continuous surveillance in mammals is necessary for a better understanding of the ecology of the CoVs and their natural hosts, which will prove useful in preventing the transmission of animals to humans and future epidemics.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonoses is to keep people away from the ecological niches of the natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.
Several pieces of the puzzle of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First, if bats transmit an ancestral virus of SARS-CoV-2 to pangolins, it is important to find out under what circumstances bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in transmission to humans, it should be determined how people come into contact with bats.
Thirdly, if a third mammal has the role of the true intermediate host, it needs to be clarified how it interacts with the different species, including human beings, bats and pangolins.
Finally, since several mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental infection should be performed.
If it is a bat, pangolim or other mammal, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its parent viruses that are almost identical will be identified in their natural hosts in the future.
Continuous research in this area will elucidate the evolutionary route of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria for "suspected case" and "confirmed case" of COVID-19
On February 6, 2020, our team published a quick guide to the diagnosis and treatment of the infection of the new 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV). This guide transmits our experience and constitutes a good reference to combating this global pandemic.
However, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is new. Our understanding and knowledge gradually increase based on the constant discoveries of research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also updated continuously.
In this letter, we answered a comment on our guide and provided the most recent diagnostic criteria for "suspected case" and "confirmed case" according to the latest Guides for Diagnostics and Treatment of COVID-19 (seventh version) published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak, which is now officially referred to as the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and the virus is called coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO classified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick guidance guide published online at the Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
He has attracted excellent attention since publication.
However, note that COVID-19 is a new disease. Our understanding and knowledge gradually increase based on the constant discoveries of research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also updated continuously.
For example, the Guidelines for Diagnostics and Treatment of COVID-19 published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020 have a total of seven editions with substantial changes in the context in some.
Our guide has now received a comment from Zhou et al., who presented a simple score proposal based on his clinical experience.
This work added new evidence to our guide and also makes valuable references to this global pandemic.
We endorse your meaningful work and express our gratitude.
However, his work also needs to be updated according to the latest Guides for Diagnostics and Treatment of COVID-19 (seventh trial version) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), in order to confirm the case, it is necessary to combine an item of epidemiological history elements with two items of clinical manifestations to perform a comprehensive analysis, or three items of clinical manifestations should there be no clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and in nearby areas or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to symptoms; (2) a history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with positive nucleic acid test); (3) a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from the city of Wuhan and nearby areas or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to symptoms; (4) a history of contact with confirmed cases (greater or equal to two cases with fever and/or respiratory symptoms occurring within 2 weeks in small spaces, such as home, office, classroom, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with imaging resources for COVID-19 infection; (3) count of total white blood cells showing normal, decreased or reduced lymphocyte count at the initial stage of symptom onset.
The confirmed case diagnosis should be based on suspected case with any of the following serological or pathogenic items: (1) positive PCR examination for SARS-CoV-2; (2) complete viral genome sequence showing high homogeneity in relation to the known new coronary virus; (3) positive for specific IgM and IgG antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 under serum examination; or any modification of the specific IgG antibody for SARS-CoV-2 from negative to positive or increased title greater than or equal to four times in the recovery phase above that in the acute phase.
It may be noted that the real-time PCR exam for nucleic acid in blood samples or respiratory tract was added to the second and third edition (18-22 January 2020, respectively).
Pathogenic blood sample detection was added to the fourth and fifth edition (from 27 January 2020 and 8 February 2020 respectively), and serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These modifications are based on the continuous work of researchers in the search for an ideal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis and samples of the respiratory tract, including blood sampling, which increased the availability of different specimens and helped bring the positive result of specific antibodies to the confirmed criteria.
In addition, there is increasing evidence that reminds us of paying attention to symptomatic and asymptomatic atypical patients.
Therefore, the flow chart of Zhou et al. should be updated, since it classifys the person without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The scoring system also needs to be verified in more clinical studies and practices.
In conclusion, we look forward to more direct evidence and ask readers to provide their comments.
For the diagnosis of "suspected case" and "confirmed case", we suggest that they verify and obey the most recent guidelines of their countries of origin.
Our team will also timely update our guide to offer help.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths due to COVID-19, largest daily
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19 in the day.
This is the largest number of deaths in one day due to the virus.
On yesterday's date, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that the number of confirmed cases registered included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases that remained at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
In an online news, IEDCR's director, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said that the deaths included four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were over 60 years old, two were between 51 and 60 years old and one were between 41 and 50 years old.
She also said that two of the victims were from Ifa.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic on March 11.
A hospital agent told Anadolu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, who was treated at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video release, the minister of road transport and Obaidul Quader bridges said that public transport would be paralyzed for longer than initially planned until next Saturday.
This paralysis of public transport began on March 26, and was planned to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transport of essential products (medical products, fuel and food) was still permitted.
The first incidents of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh were recorded on March 8, in two people returning from Italy and also in one of them's wives.
On March 19, the three had already recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 exceeds one million infections worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of infections by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 worldwide increased from one million, indicated the data from Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52,000 deaths were related to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
This mark came on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infections and Zambia had its first virus-related death.
North Korea stated that until Thursday it was one of the few remaining countries free of coronavirus infections.
Until yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases 24 hours before 10h in the Central European Time (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus were recorded, linked to at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reported, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, that there were more than 1,000 deaths in the US caused by coronavirus infections on Wednesday.
Around the world, countries have announced stricter measures to inhibit the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the total blockade of the city until May 1.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin stated that the Russians would continue to be paid without coming to work until 30 April.
The Parliament of Portugal voted to extend the state of emergency within 15 days. The vote was adopted by 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia extended for the whole day the duration of the touch to collect in the sacred cities of Mecca and Medina. Previously, this duration was only from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m.
Thailand plans to implement pickup touch from 22h to 4h
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state had extended the order to stay home until May 1.
Stores in Australia reduce limits of toilet paper by transaction
On Saturday and Sunday evening, the Australian Woolworths and Coles stores networks reduced the restrictions on the purchase of toilet paper, respectively, for two packages and one package per transaction in all shops in the country.
On Monday, ALDI also implemented a package limit.
These limitations were communicated by messages in the boxes and Facebook pages of the networks.
Out of fear of COVID-19, buyers were supposedly stocking in case there was a need to isolate themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited purchases of toilet paper with home delivery to one package per order.
These changes came after the previous restriction of four packages per transaction implemented by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles, in her March 8 press release, reported that, even with the restriction of four packages, "many stores are still running out of stock in less than an hour after delivery" and called the demand for "unprecedented", while ALDI called it "unexpected" in a Facebook post on Tuesday.
Sales had a "increased increase" last week, according to a Woolworth spokesperson.
Costco store in Cameroon also limited the amount allowed for two packages last week.
To further alleviate the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased the frequency of delivery, Woolworths ordered extra stock, while ALDI made pre-available stocks of a planned promotion for Wednesday.
Russel Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Association of Varejists, said retailers are trying to increase stocks, but local board restrictions on truck delivery frequency make this difficult.
It expects high production costs, as suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that, after early release of the stock, some stores will not be able to carry out the promotion on Wednesday.
In a report from News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, retail specialist at the University of Technology in Queensland, said stores put the stock back every night.
He pointed out that the hygienic paper is a bulky item with low numbers in stock in terms of quantity, and that, when exhausted, leaves many empty spaces in the shelves, increasing the feeling of scarcity.
Coles and Woolworths have the view that if there was an abundant amount in the shelves, if products such as toilet paper rolls and antiseptics could be [buyed] and were there in quantities, you would probably reduce panic, Russel Zimmerman told ABC News.
The manufacturer of recycled toilet paper Who Givens Crap said last Wednesday they would run out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, which produces the hygiene paper Kleinex, and Solaris Paper, which produces Sorbent, emphasized that they were working 24 hours a day/7 days a week to maintain supply, according to news.com.au report.
The domain.com real estate site reported that some real estate sellers were offering free toilet paper to the first auction bidders in Melbourne, when fewer auctions were being held with buyers entering strike on the extended weekend of Labor Day.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a Darwinian daily print, included an insert of eight pages in order to be cut and used as a toilet paper.
Initially, stores were reluctant to impose restrictions, according to an ABC Australia report on March 3, in which they said they had no plans to implement restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also with high demand, such as masks, antiseptics, dry products, hand soaps and flour.
As in Australia, on Sunday night, the British online store Ocado limited the purchases of the toilet paper Andres to two packs of 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization declares the pandemic of COVID-19
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the current outbreak of COVID-19 — the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 — is a pandemic.
Although the word "pandemia" indicates only the degree of spread of a disease, not how dangerous are the specific cases, WHO stressed the need to drive governments to act:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries are able to detect, test, treat, isolate, track and mobilize the population for a response, says Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director General of WHO.
We are very concerned about the alarming levels of dissemination and gravity and the alarming levels of lack of action.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the United States Disease Control and Prevention Centres, is a "unprecedented" pandemic.
In comments published by CNN in February, he stated that "outside the influenza, no other respiratory virus was monitored from the emergence to the continuous global dissemination".
Ghebreysus expressed a similar position, stating that "we had never seen a pandemic initiated by a coronavirus".
And he went on "and we never saw a pandemic that could be controlled at the same time."
The new pandemic status follows the WHO decision of January to declare the outbreak an emergency of public health of international concern.
The director of the U.S. National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said that the outbreak, "in short, will worsen."
On Thursday, the Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, with more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019–20 pandemic of coronavirus is a continuous pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and declared an international public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020 and recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
By 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 cases had been reported in 210 countries and territories, with approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people recovered.
It is estimated that the mortality rate is 4% in China, while overall it varies from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and lack of air.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is approximately five days, but may vary from two to fourteen days.
There is no known specific vaccine or antiviral treatment.
Primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended prevention measures include handwashing, covering the mouth when coughing, keeping away people and monitoring and isolation of people suspected of infection.
The authorities around the world responded with the implementation of travel restrictions, quarantines, pick-up touches, workplace risk controls and closure of establishments.
The pandemic caused a severe global socio-economic interruption, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events and widespread scarcity of supplies exacerbated by the purchases triggered by panic.
Schools and universities closed at national or local level in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of the world's student population.
The disinformation on the virus has spread online and incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, people with descendants and appearance of East and Southeast Asia and other people from areas with significant cases of the virus have occurred.
Due to the reduction of travel and the closures of the heavy industry, there was a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei province) reported a group of cases of pneumonia due to unknown cause on 31 December 2019 and an investigation was initiated in early January 2020.
In large part, the cases were linked to the wholesaler market of Janan's seafood and, therefore, it is believed that the virus has zoonotic origin.
The trigger virus of the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a recently discovered virus that has close connection with the bat, pangolim and SARS-CoV coronary virus. The first person with symptoms of which one has known was sick on December 1, 2019 and did not have visible connections with the posterior group of the sea fruit market.
From the initial group of cases reported in December 2019, it was found that two thirds had a link with the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post suggested that one case pointed to 17 November 2019, in a 55-year-old individual from Hubei province, which may have been the first. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that, as the new cases reported decreased in China, but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There may be significant underreporting of cases, especially among people with lighter symptoms.
By 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported among young people aged 19 or younger, accounting for 2.4% of cases worldwide. United Kingdom's leading scientific consultant Patrick Vallance estimated that 60% of the British population would need to be infected until effective collective immunity could be achieved.
The cases refer to the number of people who were tested for COVID-19 and whose tests were confirmed positive according to the official protocols.
By March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population and several countries had adopted official policies not to test people with only mild symptoms such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March found that, until 23 January, it was estimated that 86% of COVID-19 infections had not been detected and that these undocumented infections were the source of infection of 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of people infected in Italy was considerably higher than the reported cases.
The initial estimates of the basic number of reproduction (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the US Disease Control and Prevention Center concluded that it can be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not recover, the time from the onset of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, being the most common 14 days.
By 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were attributed to COVID-19.
In China, up to 5 February, approximately 80% of deaths occurred in people over 60 years of age and 75% had pre-existing medical conditions, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. The official death count by the COVID-19 pandemic usually refers to people who died and had a positive test for COVID, according to official protocols.
The actual number of deaths by COVID-19 may be much larger, since it may not include people who died without having done the test, for example, who died at home, at rest homes, etc.
Italy's partial data showed that the additional number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID death count by a factor of 4-5x.
A spokesperson for the U.S. disease control and prevention centres (CDC) acknowledged that "we know that [the number of official deaths] is underestimated", a statement corroborated by episode reports of undernotification in the United States. This underestimation often occurs in pandemics, such as the H1N1 swine flu epidemic in 2009. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan, on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside China occurred on February 1, in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on February 14.
On 28 February, outside China, more than a dozen deaths had already been recorded in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
On March 13, more than forty countries and territories reported deaths on all continents except Antarctica. Several measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary according to the region and over time and are influenced by the volume of tests, quality of the health system, treatment options, time since the initial outbreak and the characteristics of the population, such as age, sex and general health. The fatality coefficient represents the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed in a given interval.
Based on the statistics of Johns Hopkins University, the overall fatality coefficient is 6.0% (97.039/1.617.204) until 10 April 2020.
The number varies according to the region.
In China, estimates of the fatality coefficient fell from 17.3% (in people with onset of symptoms between 1–10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for people with onset of symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other measures include the mortality rate (CFR), which represents the percentage of people diagnosed who die due to a disease, and the lethality rate of infection (IFR), which represents the percentage of infected (diagnosised and undiagnosed) who die due to the disease.
These statistics are not static in time and follow a specific population of infection through case resolution.
Some academics have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The University of Oxford Evidence-Based Medicine Centre estimates that the mortality rate of infection for the pandemic, in general, is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The higher estimate of this interval is compatible with the results of the first random test for COVID-19 in Germany and with a statistical study that analyzed the impact of the tests on the CFR estimates.
WHO claims that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and maximum duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may change according to the location.
Maciej Boni, from the State University of Pennsylvania, said that, "without proper control, infectious epidemics usually reach their peak and then fall when there are no more hosts available for the disease.
But it is almost impossible to make any appropriate projection at the moment about when that will happen."
Chinese government senior medical adviser Zhong Nanshan argued that "it can end until June" if all countries mobilize to follow WHO recommendations on measures to prevent the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in London declared that SARS-CoV-2 "will probably continue in circulation for one or two years".
According to the Imperial College study, led by Neil Ferguson, physical distance and other measures will be necessary "until a vaccine is available (potentially within 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University stated: "I think it is unlikely that this coronavirus will disappear completely, since it is highly communicable" and "that may become a seasonal disease, reappearing every year."
The virulence of the re-appearance will depend on group immunity and the extent of the mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively non-specific and infected people may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory secretion production (catarra), loss of olfactory sensation, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhoea or cyanosis. WHO states that approximately one in six people is seriously ill and has difficulty breathing.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists that emergency symptoms are the difficulty in breathing, pain or pressure in the persistent chest, sudden confusion, difficulty walking and face or lips with blue coloring. It is advised to seek medical help if these symptoms are present. Evolution of the disease can cause severe pneumonia, acute respiratory discomfort syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and death.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, without clinical symptoms, but with results from the tests that confirm the infection, therefore, researchers recommend that those who were in close contact with a person with confirmed infection be monitored and examined closely to rule out the infection.
The Chinese estimates of the asymptomatic ratio range from some to 44%.
The usual period of incubation (the time between the onset of infection and symptoms) varies from one to 14 days, but is usually five days. As an example of uncertainty, the estimate of the fraction of people with COVID-19 who lost the olfactory sensation was initially 30% and subsequently dropped to 15%.
Some details on how the disease spreads are still being determined.
It is believed that this disease is spread mainly by close contact and small droplets produced during the act of coughing, sneezing or talking, being the close contact considered from 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that coughing without covering the mouth can cause the goths to reach between 4.5 metres (15 feet) and 8.2 metres (27 feet).
Some people have proposed that the virus may also be transmitted by goths that remain for longer periods in the air, which may have been generated during a conversation. Breathing goths can also be produced during expiration, including when speaking, although the virus is not normally in suspension.
The goths can lie in the mouths and noses of close people or possibly be inhaled by the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause nebulization of respiratory secretions, resulting in air propagation.
The propagation can also occur when someone touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches the eyes, nose, or mouth.
Although there is concern that it may spread through the faeces, it is believed that the risk of this happening is low.
The government of China denied the possibility of the oro-fetal transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although transmission may be possible before the symptoms appear and at later stages of the disease.
There were positive tests for the disease up to three days prior to the onset of symptoms, suggesting that transmission is possible even before the development of significant symptoms.
There are only a few reports of asymptomatic cases confirmed by laboratory, but asymptomatic transmission was identified in some countries during contact tracking investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that although it is not entirely clear how easy the disease spreads, a person usually infects two to three other people. The virus survives from hours to days on the surface.
Specifically, it was found that the virus is detectable for up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, for one day in cardboard and for up to four hours in copper.
However, this varies according to humidity and temperature. Estimated animals and other animals have already tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can pass the virus to humans. However, British authorities advise to wash their hands after contact with animals, as well as after contact with surfaces that infected people may have touched.
Coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to a set of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus resemble those of coronavirus related to its nature. Outside the human body, the virus dies by homemade soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. The SARS-CoV-2 is closely associated with the original SARS-CoV.
It is believed to have zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus is genetically associated with the genus Betacoronavirus, subgener Sarbecovirus (line B). Two strains of this same strain are derived from bats.
It has 96% similarity, throughout the genome level, to other samples of coronavirus coming from bats (BatCoV RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one difference amino acid in certain parts of the genome sequences between the pangolin virus and that of humans.
The comparison of the entire genome, so far, found a maximum of 92% of genetic material sharing between the pangolim coronavirus and the SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that pangolins are the intermediate host.
Virus infection can be provisionally diagnosed based on symptoms. The definitive confirmation, however, is by reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or computerized tomography (TC).
A study done in Wuhan, comparing RRT-PCR to CT suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive, although less specific, with many of its image characteristics matching other pneumonias and pathological processes.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "TC not be used for screening or as a front-line test for the diagnosis of COVID-19".
WHO published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on 17 January.
The test uses reverse transcription followed by reaction and chain polymerase (rRT-PCR) in real time.
The test can be performed in respiratory or blood samples.
The results are usually available from a few hours a day.
Generally, this test is performed in nasopharyngeal scrub although the throat rub is also used. Several laboratories and companies are developing serological tests, capable of detecting antibodies.
On 6 April 2020, none of these had been sufficiently accurate to be approved for general use.
A serological test developed by Cellex in the United States was approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories.
The particularities of radiographs and computed tomography (CT) images of symptomatic individuals include asymmetrical dark glass opacitys and absence of pleural discharges.
The Italian Radiological Society is gathering an on-line international database of image results in confirmed cases.
Due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, images without PCR confirmation are of limited specificity in the identification of COVID-19.
A large study in China compared the results of thoracic CT with those of PCR and showed that although the image is less specific to infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting its consideration as a tool for research in epidemic areas.
Convolutional neural networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to detect the characteristics of images of the virus with X-rays and CT.
Strategies to avoid transmission of the disease include maintaining good personal hygiene in general, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth without washing your hands, coughing or sneezing on a paper sheet and placing this sheet directly in a waste container.
It is recommended that those who have already been infected wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to avoid transmission. Many governments have restricted or advised non-essential travel going to or from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
The virus, however, has reached the stage of Community spread in vast regions of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities and that some community members do not know where or how they were infected. It is recommended to health professionals who care for individuals who may be infected using standard precautions, contact precautions and eye protection. Contact tracking is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent subsequent transmission.
The use by governments of localization data from cell phones for this purpose has raised questions of privacy, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issuing a statement requesting limits to this type of surveillance.
Several mobile applications have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use. On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are working on privacy friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record a user's proximity to other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they were in close contact with someone who tested positive for the COVID-19. Some incorrect concepts about how to prevent infection have circulated, such as rinse the nose and scratch with coultories, which has already proved ineffective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19. However, several organizations are working towards the development of one.
Washing hands is recommended to avoid the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with water and soap for at least twenty seconds, especially after using the toilet or when the hands are visibly dirty. You should also wash your hands before eating and after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing.
This is because, outside the human body, the virus is killed by homemade soap, which breaks its protective layer.
The CDC also recommends the use of alcohol-based hands hygiene with a minimum volume of 60% alcohol, when soap and water are not readily available.
WHO advises to avoid touching the eyes, nose, or mouth without washing your hands.
Surfaces can be decontaminated with various solutions (up to one minute exposure to disinfectant for a stainless steel surface), including ethanol at 62–71%, isopropyl alcohol at 50–100%, sodium hypochlorite at 0.1%, hydrogen peroxide at 0.5% and iodopovidone at 0.2–7.5%.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that, in case of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 in a location, such as an office or day care centre, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, electronic equipment shared such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls and electronic boxes used by sick people should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend covering their mouth and nose with a folded elbow or a paper sheet when coughing or sneezing, as well as immediately discarding any sheet.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who may be infected, since using a mask can limit the volume and distance of movement of expiratory drops when speaking, sneezing or coughing.
WHO published instructions on when and how to wear masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "The use of masks can reduce the propensity of people to touch their faces, which is one of the biggest sources of infection without the proper hygiene of their hands."It has also been recommended that masks be used by caregivers of people who may have the disease.
WHO recommended the use of masks by healthy people only when they are at high risk, such as caregivers of people with COVID-19, although they also recognize that wearing masks can help people not touch their own face.
In several countries, the use of masks for the face by the general public has begun to be encouraged.
In the USA, the CDC recommends the use of non-medical masks for the face made of cloth. China specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks by healthy people in general, especially when coming into close contact with another person (making 1 metre or less away).
In Hong Kong, it is recommended to use a surgical mask when using public transport or when staying in crowded places.
Thailand's health authorities are encouraging people to make facial masks at home and wash them daily.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, it is forbidden to go out in public without wearing a mask or covering the nose and mouth.
On 16 March, Vietnam requested everyone to wear facial masks when going out in public areas in order to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has demanded that everyone entering supermarkets should wear a face mask.
In Israel, all residents were asked to wear masks for their faces in public.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks per day since mid-March, required passengers on intermunicipal trains and buses to wear masks on their face from 1 April.
In Panama, the use of masks for the face is mandatory when going out on the street. At the same time, the production of masks at home was recommended for those who could not buy.
Face masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) involves infection control actions aimed at slowing down the transmission of the disease, by reducing close contact between individuals.
Methods include quarantines, travel restrictions and closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters or shopping centers.
Social distancing methods can be applied by everyone when they stay at home, limit their travels, avoid crowded areas, use contactless greetings and keep away from others.
At the moment, many governments are forcing or recommending social distancing in regions affected by the epidemic.
The maximum number of people gathered recommended by U.S. government bodies and health organizations was rapidly reduced from 250 people (if there is no knowledge of transmission of COVID-19 in one region) to 50 people and then to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public meetings of more than two people. Older adults and those with underlying diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension and compromised immune systems face greater risk of serious diseases and complications, being advised by the CDC to stay at home as much as possible in areas of community epidemic. By the end of March 2020, WHO and other health organs began to replace the use of the term "social distancing" with "physical distancing", to clarify that the objective is to reduce physical contact by maintaining social connections, either virtually or at a distance.
The use of the term "social distancing" led to implications that social isolation was necessary completely rather than encouraging contact by other alternative means. Some authorities published sexual health guidelines during the pandemic.
These recommendations include having sex only with someone you live with, who does not have the virus or symptoms of the virus.
Self-insulation at home was recommended for those who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and for those who suspected that they were infected.
The health agencies issued detailed instructions for proper self-insulation. Many governments demanded or recommended autofortenance for entire populations living in affected areas.
The most incisive auto quarantine instructions were issued to those in high-risk groups.
Individuals who may have been exposed to others with COVID-19 and those who have recently traveled to a country or region with large-scale transmission that have taken 14 days of auto quarantine since the last possible exposure were advised.
Strategies for controlling an outbreak are containment or suppression and reduction.
The containment is carried out at the preliminary stages of an outbreak and aims to track and isolate the infected, as well as to present other measures to control the infection and vaccines that prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When the spread of the disease is no longer possible, efforts are being made towards reduction: the measures taken now serve to reduce the rate of spread and to reduce its adverse effects on the health system, as well as on the population.
Containment and mitigation measures may be taken at the same time in combination.
The suppression requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic at a basic reproductive rate below 1. Management of an outbreak of infectious disease, in part, has to do with trying to reduce the peak of the epidemic. To this, we call "buying the epidemic curve".
Thus, the risk of overloading health services is reduced, giving more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.
Interventions that are not pharmaceutical and may administer the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, use of masks for face and self-quarantine; Community measures aimed at physical distance, such as closure of schools and cancellation of events leading to agglomerations; community involvement, in order to stimulate acceptance and participation in these interventions; and environmental measures such as cleaning of contact surfaces. More drastic actions, in order to contain the outbreak, were taken in China when the severity of the outbreak became clear. Whole cities, for example, remained in quarantine and travel bans were imposed.
Other countries have taken various measures to ensure that the spread of the virus is limited.
South Korea, for example, presented mass screening and the localized quarantines. In addition, the government issued warnings about the movement of infected people.
In Singapore, the infected received financial support when they performed the auto quarantine and, for those who did not, severe fines were imposed.
In Taiwan, there was an increase in the production of masks for the face and those that stored medical supplies were punished. Simulations carried out in the United Kingdom and the United States show that the reduction (the decrease in the rate of contagion, without stopping the spread of the epidemic) and the suppression (i.e., the reversal of the epidemic growth) present great challenges.
Ideal reduction policies can reduce the peak demand for health services by 2/3 and deaths by half. Nevertheless, this would result in hundreds of thousands of deaths, at the same time overloading health systems.
The suppression may be the best alternative, but it needs to be maintained as long as there is the circulation of the virus by the human population or until there is the availability of a vaccine, if this occurs before. Otherwise, transmission occurs so soon as the measures are relaxed.
A long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic brings social and economic costs.
There is no approved antiviral medicine that is specific to COVID-19. However, there are efforts towards the development of medicines, which include the test of existing medicines.
The use of medicines for cooling that do not require medical prescription, drink enough fluid and rest may help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the case, it may be necessary to use oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid insertion or respiratory aid.
The use of steroids may make the condition worse.
Several compounds previously approved to treat other viral diseases are under investigation to be used in the treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization also stated that some "home and traditional" medicines can relieve symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19 virus.
WHO describes the increase in capacity and adaptation of health care to the needs brought by COVID-19 as fundamental measures to combat the outbreak.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, and the WHO office in Europe have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services to deploy, at various levels, their resources, including the concentration of laboratory services for the testing of COVID-19, the cancellation of non-compulsory procedures and the separation and isolation of patients with a positive test for COVID-19, in addition to increasing intensive care capabilities through training of staff and increasing the number of beds and fans available.
There are several theories about the emergence of the first case (the so-called patient zero).
The first known case in the new coronavirus dates from 1 December 2019 in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.
In one month, the number of coronavirus cases in the region gradually increased.
These cases were largely linked to the wholesale market for fruits of the sea of Huanan. The market also sold live animals, which led to the theory that the virus came from one of these animals. In other words, it was believed that it had a zoonotic origin. On December 26, a group of patients was observed and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at Hubei Provincial Hospital. The next day, the doctor informed the Wuhan Jianghan Disease Prevention and Control Center.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a "SARS-type coronavirus".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were reprimanded by the police for spreading false news. Another doctor, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by his superiors for giving the alarm.
On December 31, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission made a statement to the population and informed WHO.
Sufficient cases of unknown origin pneumonia had already been reported to the Wuhan health authorities to generate an investigation in early January. During the first stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled every seven and a half days, approximately.
In the beginning and mid-January 2020, the virus spread across other provinces of China, facilitated by the migration of the Chinese new year and the fact that Wuhan was a transport center, as well as a main point of rail connection.
On January 20, China reported about 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzen.
Later official data show that 6,174 people had already developed the symptoms by January 20, 2020. On March 26, the United States overcame China and Italy, with the largest number of confirmed cases in the world. On April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide; over 97,000 people died, and over 364,000 recovered.
Approximately 200 countries and territories have already had at least one case.
As a result of the pandemic in Europe, many countries that are part of the Schengen Treaty have restricted free movement and established border controls.
The country’s reactions included containment measures, such as quarantine (also known as house confinement orders, house containment orders or lockdown) and pick-up touches. On April 2, some 300 million people (almost 90% of the population) are somehow confined in the United States, more than 50 million people are confined in the Philippines, about 59 million people are confined in South Africa and 1.3 billion people are confined in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were already in some form of lockdown, which increased to 2.6 billion people two days later, about a third of the world’s population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was registered in Wuhan on 1 December 2019. An unconfirmed report suggests a previous case of 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a group of patients with pneumonia of unknown causes on December 26. His hospital informed the Wuhan Jianghan Disease Prevention and Control Center on December 27.
Initial genetic tests, on December 27, 2019, in samples taken from patients indicated the presence of a SARS-type coronavirus.
A communiqué to the population was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on 31 December.
WHO was informed on the same day.
When these notifications occurred, Wuhan's doctors were warned by the police about spreading rumors about the outbreak.
The National Health Commission of China initially claimed that there is no "clear evidence" of transmission among human beings.
At the end of January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign, later described by the secretary general of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, as a "war of the people", to contain the spread of the virus.
In what was described as "the greatest quarantine in the history of humanity", a health cord was announced on January 23 to interrupt trips from or back to Wuhan, which was extended by 15 cities in Hubei, reaching about 57 million people in total.
The use of private vehicles has been prohibited in the city.
The celebrations of the Chinese New Year, on January 25, were cancelled in several locations.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, the Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital, Leishenshan, was subsequently built to care for more patients.
Together with the newly built hospitals, China has converted 14 other institutions of Wuhan into temporary hospitals, such as convention centres and stadiums. On 26 January, the government launched more measures to contain the outbreak of COVID-19, including the issuance of health statements for travellers and the extension of the Spring Festival holiday.
Universities and schools throughout the country were also closed.
The regions of Hong Kong and Macau have taken various measures, in particular with regard to schools and universities.
Measures for remote work have been taken in many regions of the country.
Travel restrictions were made in and out of Hubei.
Public transport was modified, and museums throughout China were temporarily closed.
The control of public movement was applied in several cities, and it was estimated that about 760 million people (more than half of the population) went through some sort of exit restriction. After the outbreak entered its global phase in March, the Chinese authorities took strict measures to avoid the "importation" of the virus from other countries.
Beijing, for example, imposed a 14-day mandatory quarantine for all international travelers arriving in the city. On 23 March, mainland China had only one case of domestic transmission in five days, in that case, through a traveler who returned to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, the Chinese prize, Li Keqiang, reported that the spread of domestic transmission cases had been basically blocked and that the outbreak had been controlled in China.
On the same day, travel restrictions were reduced in Hubei, except in Wuhan, two months after the lockdown was imposed. China’s Foreign Minister announced on 26 March 2020 that the entry of individuals with visa or residence permit would be suspended from 28 March, without specific details about when this policy will be closed.
Anyone wishing to enter China will need to apply for visas in Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government encouraged companies and factories to reopen on March 30, giving financial stimulus packages to companies. The Council of State declared a mourning day, beginning with a moment of three minutes of silence in the whole country, on April 4 at 10 hours, coincidering with the Qingming Festival. The central government, however, asked families to pay their homage online, observing the physical distance to avoid a new outbreak of COVID-19.
On 20 January 2020, the spread of China's COVID-19 to South Korea was confirmed.
The country's national health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases on February 20, largely attributed to a meeting in Daegu of a new religious movement known as the Church of Jesus of Shincheonji.
It is suspected that the devotees of Shincheonji who visited Daegu from Wuhan were the origin of the outbreak.
On 22 February, among the 9,336 church followers, 1,261, or about 13% of them, reported having symptoms. South Korea declared maximum alert level on February 23, 2020.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported, reaching 3,150 on 29 February.
All South Korean military bases were placed in quarantine after tests confirmed that three soldiers were positive for the virus.
The schedule of the air lines was also affected and modified. South Korea presented what was considered the world's largest and best organized program in terms of screening the population for the virus. The country also isolated the infected people and tracked and placed in quarantine those who came in contact with them.
The screening methods included the mandatory individual report of symptoms for those arriving from international travel through a mobile application, drive-thru virus test, with results available the following day, in addition to the increase in test capacity, which allowed up to 20,000 people per day to be tested.
South Korea's program is considered a success in controlling the outbreak, although it has not placed entire cities in quarantine. South Korean society was initially divided as to the response to the crisis given by President Moon Jae-in.
Many Koreans signed petitions requesting Moon's impeachment under the claim of government mismanagement of the outbreak, or raising their response.
On 23 March, it was reported that South Korea had the total number of cases lower in four weeks.
On 29 March it was reported that from 1 April all new arrivals from abroad should enter quarantine for two weeks.
Through media reports on April 1, South Korea received requests for help with testing the virus from 121 different countries.
Iran confirmed its first cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection on 19 February in Qom, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died that day.
Early measures announced by the government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural events, sporting events, and religious events on Fridays, the closure of universities, higher education institutions, and schools.
Iran has five trillion Rials for the fight against the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani said on February 26, 2020 that he had no plans for the quarantine areas affected by the outbreak, and only individuals would be placed in quarantine.
Plans to limit trips between the cities were announced in March, although heavy traffic between the cities before the New Persian Year Nowruz continued.
Shiite shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020. Iran became the center of the spread of the virus after China during February.
In the midst of allegations of coverage of the extent of the outbreak in Iran, more than ten countries tracked their cases related to Iran on 28 February indicating that the extent of the outbreak could be more serious than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government until that date.
The Iranian Parliament was closed, with 23 of its 290 members with positive testing for the virus on 3 March.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch vehemently requested Iranian prison authorities to release unconditionally human rights defenders imprisoned for peaceful dissent, and also to temporarily release all eligible prisoners.
The organ stated that there is a higher risk of spread of the virus in closed institutions as detention centers, which also suffer from the lack of medical care.
On March 15, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in a single day, the largest number since the outbreak in the country.
At least 12 active or retired politicians and government officials died as a result of the disease until March 17.
By March 23, Iran had 50 new cases per hour and a new death every ten minutes due to the Coronavirus.
According to a WHO representative, there must be five times as many cases in Iran as are being reported.
It is suggested that US sanctions imposed on Iran may be affecting the country's financial capacity to respond to the viral pandemic.
The High Commissioner for Human Rights requested that economic sanctions be alleviated to the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
The outbreak was confirmed as having spread to Italy on 31 January, when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
The cases began to rise sharply, which led the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare state of emergency.
A group not associated with the cases of COVID-19 was subsequently detected, starting with 16 cases confirmed in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced a decree-law to contain the outbreak, including the quarantine of more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "In the areas of outbreak, entry and exits of people are prohibited.
The suspension of work activities and sporting events had already been determined in these areas. "On March 4, the Italian government requested the total closure of all schools and universities by the country when Italy reached 100 deaths.
All the great sporting events, including the football matches of the Series A, have to be held at closed doors until April, but on March 9, all sporting events were completely suspended for at least one month.
On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte requested the closure of almost all commercial activities, except supermarkets and drugstores. On 6 March, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published recommendations of medical ethics regarding the screening protocols that could be used.
On March 19, Italy moved to China as the country with the most deaths related to Coronavirus in the world after reporting 3,405 deaths related to the pandemic.
On 22 March, it was reported that Russia sent nine military planes with medical supplies to Italy.
From 5 April, there were 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 recovered in Italy, with most of these cases occurring in the Lombardy region.
A CNN report indicated that the combination of an elderly population in Italy and the inability to test everyone who had the virus so far may have contributed to a high mortality rate.
The UK response to the virus first emerged as one of the softest in the affected countries, and until 18 March 2020 the British government had not imposed any form of social distancing or massive quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government received criticisms for the recognized lack of diligence and intensity of its response to the problems faced by the population. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a statement in which he advised the interruption of all non-essential and social contact trips, suggesting that people worked at home as much as possible and avoid places such as bars, restaurants and theaters.
On 20 March, the government announced that all leisure establishments, such as pubs and academies, should be closed as quickly as possible, and committed to paying 80% of workers' wages up to a limit of 2,500 pounds per month to avoid unemployment during the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced heavier social distancing measures, preventing agglomeration with more than two people and restricting travel and outdoor activities to the minimum necessary.
Unlike the previous measures, these restrictions were reinforced by the police by issuing fines and dispersal of agglomerations.
Most businesses received orders to close, with exceptions for business considered "essential", including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, gas stations and car shop.

On January 28, 2020, the Center for Disease Control — the U.S. government’s leading public health institute — announced that they had developed their own test kit.
Despite doing so, the United States had a slow start to the tests, which obscured the true extent of the outbreak at that time.
The test was marked by defective test kits produced by the federal government in February, a lack of federal government approval for test kits that were not government (of academies, companies and hospitals) until the end of February, and restrictive criteria for people who would be tested until the beginning of March (a medical request was subsequently required).
Until February 27, Washington Post reported that less than 4,000 tests had been performed in the United States.
Until March 13, The Atlantic reported that less than 14,000 tests had been performed.

A medical screening was performed prior to boarding, and four South Africans who demonstrated signs of coronavirus were left behind to mitigate the risks.
Only the South Africans who tested negative were repatriated.
The results of the tests released all South Africans, including flight crew, pilots, hotel team, police and soldiers involved in the humanitarian mission who, as a preventive measure, remained in observation and quarantine for a 14-day period at the Resort The Ranch.

For example, Spain collected 58,000 Coronavirus test kits made by China with a accuracy rate of only 30%, while the Netherlands returned 600,000 facial masks that were defective.
Belgium collected 100,000 unused masks, supposedly from China, but actually from Colombia.
On the other hand, China's aid was well received in parts of Latin America and Africa. On 2 April, the World Bank launched emergency support operations for developing countries.
WHO commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities to manage and contain the epidemic.
WHO noted the contrast between the SARS outbreak 2002-2004, where the Chinese authorities were accused of omitting data that made it difficult to prevent and curbing efforts, and the current crisis, where the central government "provided regular updates to avoid the near panic of the festivities in the new lunar year".
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the main authorities to implement a ban on transport in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galea noted that "that certainly was not a WHO recommendation" and was also "a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic in the area where it was most concentrated." On 30 January, after confirmation of transmission among humans outside China and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO declared the outbreak as the Emergency of International Public Health (PHEIC), the sixth PHEIC since the measure was first invoked during the 2009 swine flu pandemic.
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom said that PHEIC was invoked due to "the risk of global dissemination, especially in low and middle-income countries without robust health systems.
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that "there is no reason for measures that interfere unnecessarily with international travel and trade" and that "WHO does not recommend limiting trade and movement."
On 5 February, WHO appealed to the global community for a contribution of $675 million to fund strategic preparation in low- and middle-income countries, citing the urgency to assist these countries that "have no systems in place to detect people who contracted the virus, even if it arises".
Tedros made further statements indicating that "we are as strong as our weakest link" and asked the international community "they now invest or will have to pay later." On February 11, WHO at a press conference established COVID-19 as the name of the disease.
On the same day, Tedros declared that the Secretary-General of the United Nations, António Guterres had agreed to provide the "power of the entire United Nations system as a response".
The United Nations Crisis Management Team was activated as a result, allowing coordination of the entire United Nations response, which WHO states will allow them to "focus on health response while other agencies can enter their social, economic and developmental experience".
On 14 February, a WHO Joint Mission Team with China was empowered to provide international experts and WHO on land in China with assistance in domestic management and to evaluate "the severity and communicability of the disease" through workshops and meetings with the main national level institutions and to conduct field visits to assess "the impact of response activities on provincial and municipal levels, including urban and rural landscapes". On 25 February, WHO stated that "the world should do more to prepare for a possible Coronavirus pandemic", stating that, although it was very early to declare a pandemic, countries should still set up "a preparatory phase".
In response to a developmental outbreak in Iran, WHO sent a Joint Mission Team to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials said that the assessment of the global Coronavirus threat would be high from "high" to "very high", is the highest level of alert and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, executive director of the health emergency program, warned in a statement that "This is a statement of reality for every government on the planet: Wake up.
This virus may be on its way and you need to be ready," insisting that correct response measures could help the world avoid "the worst."
Ryan also stated that current data did not authorize public health officials to declare a global pandemic, saying that such a declaration would mean that "we are essentially accepting that every human on the planet will be exposed to this virus."
On 11 March, WHO declared the outbreak of Coronavirus a pandemic.
The Director General said that WHO was "deeply concerned about the alarming levels of dissemination and gravity, and by the alarming levels of inaction." WHO faced many criticisms for what was seen as inadequate pandemic management, including the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
The reaction included a petition to the Director General of WHO, Tedros Adhanom to file his resignation, signed by 733,000 people on 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of United Nations human rights experts emphasized respect for the rights of each individual during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The group of experts stated that everyone has the right to interventions to save lives and that the government is responsible.
The group emphasized that the lack of resources or health plan should never serve as a justification for discrimination against a specific group.
Experts pointed out that each individual has the right to health, including people with disabilities, minorities, elderly people, people with mental problems, homeless people living in extreme poverty, prisoners, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups who need government assistance.
International government organizations are addressing the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development launched a platform to provide timely and comprehensive information on political responses in countries around the world, as well as points of view and advice.
From policies to strengthen health systems and the world economy to address the effects of confinement and travel restrictions, the digital centre includes a Country Policy Tracker, which helps countries learn from one another and facilitate a coordinated global response to the Coronavirus challenge.
The Chinese government was criticized by the United States, by the UK Cabinet Minister Michael Gove, and by the son of the president of Brazil Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro for the management of the pandemic, which began in the Chinese province of Hubei.
Administrators at the province level of the Communist Party of China (CPC) were fired because of their approach to quarantine efforts in Central China, a sign of discontent with the response of the political establishment to the outbreak in these regions.
Some commentators believe that this action was intended to protect the secretary-general of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping from public wrath in relation to the outbreak of Coronavirus.
Some Chinese officers, e.g. Zhao Lijian rejected an early recognition of the outbreak of Coronavirus that began in Wuhan, favoring conspiracy theories on COVID-19 originating in the United States or Italy.
The administration of the United States of Donald Trump referred to the Coronavirus as the "Chinese Virus" or "Wuhan Virus" saying that China's censorship "superfed a virus that now has become a global pandemic", which was in turn condemned by some critics as racism and "a way of diverting the failure in administration to contain the disease".
The Daily Beast managed to get a cable from the U.S. government a detailed communication strategy with apparent origins in the National Security Council, with a strategy being cited as "That all has to do with China.
We were advised to try and get these messages in any way, including press conferences and TV appearances. "Canals such as Politics, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg indicated that China's efforts to send aid to the countries affected by the virus are part of a propaganda for a global influence.
European Union foreign policy leader Josep Borrell warned that there is "a geopolitical component including a struggle for influence through a trendy point of view and 'generous policies'.
Borrell also said that "China is aggressively spreading the message that unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner."
China also requested the United States to suspend its sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran while allegedly sending aid to those same countries.
Jack Ma's 100 thousand masks donation to Cuba was blocked by US sanctions on April 3.
The US authorities were also accused of diverting aid to other nations to their own country.
It hears disputes related to masks reported among other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland; and the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has confiscated hundreds of fans intended for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the European Union's lack of solidarity with those affected by Coronavirus in Italy.
Maurizio Massari, Ambassador of Italy to the European Union, said that "Chinese has only responded bilaterally.
This is certainly not a good sign of European solidarity."
On March 22, after a telephone call with Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin prepared the Russian military army to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles, and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa cited an anonymous "high-level political source" that 80 percent of Russia's supplies were "useless or of little use for Italy".
The source accused Russia of embarking on a "geopolitical and diplomatic" offensive.
The president of the Lombardy region, Attilio Fontana, and the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Luigi Di Maio dispensed the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical supplies to the United States.
Kremlin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov said that "by offering help to American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when American equipment and medical materials manufacturers are in a good phase, they will also act reciprocally if necessary."
NATO's planned military exercise "Defender 2020" in Germany, Poland and the Baltic States, NATO's largest military exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be kept on a small scale.
The Secretary-General for the Nuclear Disarmament Campaign, Kate Hudson, criticized the Defence 2020 exercise: "In the current public health crisis, this puts at risk not only the lives of the United States troops and the various European countries that are participating, but the inhabitants of the countries in which they operate."The Iranian government was strongly affected by the virus, with about a dozen members of the infected parliament, as well as fifteen political figures in exercise or ex-politics.
Iran's President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to the world's leaders, asking for help on March 14, 2020, saying that his country is struggling to combat the outbreak due to the lack of access to international markets as a result of US sanctions against Iran. The outbreak led the United States to adopt common social policies in other developed countries, including universal health care, universal care, paid family leave, and high levels of funding for public health.
Political analysts anticipate that this can negatively affect Donald Trump's chances of re-election as president in the 2020 elections. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have worsened due to the pandemic.
South Korea criticized Japan's ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts, after Japan announced that any person coming from South Korea would be placed in a two-week quarantine facility designated by the government.
South Korean society was initially polarized about President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions requesting Moon's impeachment in relation to those they called inadequate management of the outbreak, or praising their response. The pandemic allowed countries to approve emergency laws as an answer.
Some commentators expressed concerns that this could enable governments to strengthen their control over power.
In Hungary, Parliament voted in such a way that the Prime Minister, Viktor Orbán, could rule by decree indefinitely, suspend the parliament as well as the elections and punish those regarded as having spread false news about the virus and the management of the crisis by the government.
The outbreak of Coronavirus has been blamed for several cases of shortage of supplies, due to the increase in the use of equipment globally to combat outbreaks, panic-motivated purchases, and disruption of operations in factories and logistics.
The U.S. Food and Administration issued warnings about the shortage of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumption and interruptions of the supplier.
Several locations also experienced the event of panic-motivated purchases which led to empty shelves of essential products such as food, toilet paper, bottled water, including supplies shortage.
The technology industry in particular has warned about delays in sending electronic products.
According to WHO general director Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protection equipment rose 100 times.
This demand led to an increase in prices of up to twenty times the normal price and also led to delays in the supply of medical items for four to six months.
This also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide, with the WHO warning that this would endanger the health of workers.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for Chinese buyers, daigou, to sell Australian products in China.
The activity created a shortage of baby formulas in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the consequent high demand for food products, both areas were spared an acute food shortage.
Measures taken by China and Italy against the illegal storage and trade in essential products were successful, avoiding the shortage of acute food that was foreseen in Europe, as well as in North America.
Northern Italy with its significant agricultural production has not seen a large reduction, but prices can increase according to industry representatives.
Empty food shelves were found only temporarily, even in the city of Wuhan, and Chinese government officials released pigmeat reserves to ensure adequate food for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy, requiring food producers to maintain reserves for such emergencies.
A damage to the global economy was felt in China: according to a media report on 16 March, the economy in China was very hit in the first two months of 2020 due to measures taken by the government to shorten the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell 20.5%.
As Continental China is a great economy and manufacturing centre, the viral outbreak was seen as a major destabilizing threat to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of The Economist's intelligence unit predicted that markets will remain volatile until a clearer image emerges on possible results.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the epidemic on global growth could exceed the outbreak of SARS 2002-2004.
An estimate of a specialist at the University of Washington in St. Louis indicated an impact of $300 billion on the world supply chain that could last up to two years.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) allegedly "confused" after a sharp decline in oil prices due to low demand from China.
Global stock markets fell on 24 February due to a significant increase in the number of cases of COVID-19 outside Continental China.
On 27 February, due to growing concerns about the outbreak of the Coronavirus, several U.S. stock exchange indices including NASDAQ-100, S&P 500, and the Dow Jones industry average showed their most significant falls since 2008, with the fall of Dow at 1,191 points, the biggest drop in one day since the 2007-08 financial crisis.
All the other three indices ended the week with a lower than 10%.
On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH stated China's sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative outlook.
The actions fell again on the basis of concerns with the coronavirus, the largest drop on March 16.
Many consider it a probable economic recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures of the states and central banks.
Central banks are reacting faster than they reacted to the 2008 financial collapse.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to travel restrictions, closure of public places including tourist points, and the recommendation of governments against any travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines cancelled their flights due to low demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Qantas, while the British regional airline Flybe collapsed.
The impact on the cruise sector was of a level never seen.
Several train stations and raft ports have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chunyun, a large travel station associated with the Chinese New Year's holiday.
Several events involving large crowds were cancelled by national and regional governments, including New Year's annual festivals, with private companies also closing independently their shops and tourist attractions such as Disneyland in Hong Kong and Shanghai.
Many New Moon Year events and tourist attractions were closed to avoid mass agglomerations, including the City Forbidden in Beijing and traditional temple events.
In 24 of the 31 provinces of China, municipalities and regions, authorities extended the New Year's holiday to 10 February, instructing most workplaces not to reopen until this date.
These regions accounted for 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong increased its response level to infectious disease to the highest level and declared emergency, closing schools until March and cancelling its New Year celebrations. The retail sector was affected globally, with reductions in store times or temporary closures.
Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
North American and Middle East resellers observed a 50-60% fall.
This also resulted in a 33-43% drop in pedestrian traffic at shopping malls in March compared to February.
Shopping Centers operators around the world have imposed additional measures, such as greater cleaning, installation of thermal scanners to check the temperature of buyers, and cancellation of events. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, it is estimated that the recession induced by the pandemic could leave between 14 and 22 million more people in extreme poverty in Latin America than would occur in situations without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the outbreak of the Wuhan epidemic, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China’s 300 million migrant rural workers have been abandoned at home in domestic provinces or arrested in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and sought government assistance.
The outbreak of the Coronavirus could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32%, according to estimates from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The confinement in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (which are paid by means of daily remuneration) unemployed. A survey by the Angus Reid Institute found that 44% of Canadian families have been unemployed. Nearly 900,000 workers have lost their jobs in Spain since the country adopted the confinement in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for unemployment aid and 1 million British workers applied for a universal credit programme. Almost half a million companies in Germany placed their workers under reduced-time work programmes subsidized by the government known as Kurzabeit.
The German reduced-time work remuneration programme was adopted by France and Great Britain.
Performatic art sectors and cultural heritage were deeply affected by the pandemic, affecting the operations of organizations, as well as people - both employed and independent - worldwide.
The arts and culture sector organizations have tried to maintain their mission (often publicly funded) to provide access to cultural heritage for the community, maintain the safety of their employees and the public and help artists when possible.
In March 2020, around the world and at various levels, museums, bookshops, performance venues, and other cultural institutions were closed indefinitely with their exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed.
In response, intensive efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and high-acceleration impact of the disease is the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events, and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences and fashion events.
The film sector also experienced an interruption. The Vatican announced that the rites of Holy Week in Rome, which would occur during the last week of the Christian Lent period, had been cancelled.
Many dioceses recommended that elderly Christians stay at home rather than attend Mass on Sundays; some churches provided church services via radio, live streaming online or by television while others offer cult drive-in style.
With the Catholic Diocese of Rome closing its churches and chapels and the square of Saint Peter empty without Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also canceled the services and limited public agglomerations in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
The Ministry of Health of Iran announced the cancellation of Friday's prayers in areas affected by the outbreak and shrines were subsequently closed, while Saudi Arabia prohibited the entry of foreign pilgrims, as well as its residents in sacred places in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most significant interruption in the world's sports calendar since World War II.
Most of the main events were cancelled or postponed, including the UEFA Champions League of 2019-2020, the Premier League of 2019-2020, the NBA season of 2019-2020, and the NHL season of 2019-2020.
The outbreak interfered with the plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, originally scheduled to start at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be "rescheduled to a date after 2020, but not after the summer of 2021". Casinos and other gaming sites around the world were closed and face poker tournaments were also postponed or cancelled.
This led many players to play online, with several online gaming sites reporting significant increases in their new registration rates. The entertainment industry was also affected, with various music groups suspending or canceling their tournaments.
Many great theaters like Broadway have also canceled all the shows.
Some artists have explored ways to continue producing and sharing their work over the Internet as an alternative to traditional live presentations, such as live broadcast shows or creating "festives" online for artists to present, share and disseminate their work.
On-line, several memes on the internet about the coronavirus are propagated, as many seek humor and entertainment in the midst of uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia and racism aimed at people of Chinese or East Asian descent, and against people from the focus areas in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents of fear, distrust, and hostility have been observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
Results of February (when most cases were still restricted to China) recorded racist feelings expressed in various groups around the world about the Chinese people deserve the virus or are being punished justly for what they caused.
Some countries in Africa have also identified an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many inhabitants of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
This has been supported by Chinese, both online and offline, and is directed to those in areas affected by the virus.
After the outbreak in new focus countries, the citizens of Italy, the first country in Europe experiencing a serious outbreak of COVID-19, could also be subjected to distrust and xenophobia. Citizens of countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed petitions pressuring Chinese entry into their countries to try to contain the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChinaDontComeToJapan went to Trending Topics on Twitter.
The Chinese people, as well as other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States, reported increasing levels of racist insults as well as attacks.
The president of the United States, Donald Trump, was the target of criticism for referring to the coronavirus as the "Chinese virus", a term considered by critics as racist and anti-Chinese.
Demonstrators in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreigners evacuated from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from northeastern India, bordering with China, and students in large cities of India allegedly suffered persecution related to the outbreak of coronavirus.
The president of the unit in the state of the Bharatiya Janata Party in West Bengal, Dilip Ghosh, said that the Chinese destroyed nature and "that is why God turned against them".
The comments were then condemned by the consulate of China in Calcutta, who called it "mistakers". In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese inhabitants were inflamed by the pandemic, with foreigners called "foreign waste" and targets "disposal".
Many newspapers with paid access removed them from some or all coverages on the coronavirus.
Several scientific editors have provided scientific articles related to the outbreak with open access.
Some scientists have chosen to share their conclusions as soon as possible on preprints servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory analyses for the respiratory disease of the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) and the associated SARS-CoV-2 virus include methods that detect the presence of the virus and those that detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of the virus in samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the coronary artery RNA.
This test is specific and developed only to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus's RNA.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Antibodies detection (sorology) can be used for diagnosis and population monitoring.
Antibody tests reveal how many people had the disease, including those whose symptoms were very mild to be reported or who were asymptomatic.
A precise rate of disease mortality and the level of herd immunity in the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, in March 2020 no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
On March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there were considerable variations in the number of tests carried out in the countries.
This variability probably still substantially affects the mortality rates of registered cases, which can be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Using the chain reaction of polymerase with real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed in respiratory samples obtained by various methods, including nasopharyngeal scrubbing or saliva sample.
The results are usually available within a few hours or within 2 days.
The RT-PCR test performed with pharyngeal scrub is reliable only in the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus may disappear in the throat while continuing to multiply in the lungs.
For infected people tested in the second week, as an alternative, the material of the samples may be removed from the bottom of the airways by suction catheter or exhaled material by expectoration (secretion) may be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020 using the chain reaction of polymerase with real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR), and serves as the basis for 250,000 kits for distribution by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK also developed a test on January 23, 2020. South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical type, a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit (PowerCheck Coronavirus) on January 28, 2020.
He is looking for the "E" gene shared by all the beta coronaviruses, and the RdRp gene, specific to SARS-CoV-2. In China, the BGI group was one of the first companies to receive the emergency approval of the National Medical Products Administration of China for the PCR-CoV-2 SARS detection kit. In the United States, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is distributing its innovative diagnostic panel for Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) of RT-PCR in real time for public health laboratories by the International Reagent Resource.
One of the three genetic tests in older versions of the test kits generated inconclusive tests due to failure reagents, and an obstacle to testing in the CDC in Atlanta; this resulted in an average of less than 100 samples per day being successfully processed throughout February 2020.
The tests using two components were not considered reliable until 28 February 2020, and only from then on the local and state laboratories were allowed to start the tests.
The test was approved by Food and Drug Administration under an emergency authorisation. Commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the national availability of the test for RT-PCR-based COVID-19.
Quest Diagnostics also made the COVID-19 tests nationally available from 9 March 2020.
No quantity restriction was announced; sample collection and processing should be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Research Centre in Virology and Biotechnology, VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was recorded by the Federal Health Surveillance Service. On 12 March 2020, Mayo Clinic claimed to have developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received a FDA approval for a test that could be performed within 3.5 hours on a large scale, thus allowing a machine to process approximately 4,128 tests over a 24-hour period.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorisation (USA) for Abbott laboratories for a test in Abbott’s m2000 system; the FDA previously issued an authorisation for Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid also received a U.S. from the FDA for a test that takes about 45 minutes.
The FDA approved a test using the amplification technology of isothermal nucleic acid instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a series of alternating cycles of temperature, this method can generate positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these machines in the USA and Abbott expects to increase production to provide 50,000 tests per day. A test that uses a monoclonal antibody and binds it in a particular way to the nucleocapside protein (N protein) of the new coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan, with the expectation of providing results in 15 to 20 minutes such as a rapid influenza test.
A literature review in March 2020 concluded that "thorax X-rays have a lower diagnostic value in the initial stages, while CT findings, computed tomography, may be present even before symptoms occur".
Typical CT features include bilateral multilobar opacity in dark glass with a posterior, peripheral and asymmetric distribution.
Subpleural dominance, mosaic paving and consolidation evolve as the disease progresses.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan at the point of origin of the current pandemic suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, with many of its imaging aspects coincidering with other pneumonias and pathological processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "TC should not be used for screening or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19." Since March 2020, the CDC recommends the PCR for an initial check.
Part of the immune response to infection is the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to detect infection in individuals initiated 7 days ago or soon after symptoms arise, to determine immunity, and to monitor the population. Trials can be performed in central laboratories (CLTs) or by means of remote laboratory tests (POCTs).
Automated high productivity systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these tests, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For CLT, a single peripheral blood sample is commonly used, although numerous samples can be used to monitor the immune response.
For POCT, a single blood sample is usually obtained by skin puncture.
Unlike the PCR methods, the collection stage is not necessary prior to the test. On March 26, 2020, the FDA indicated 29 entities that notified the agency, as required, and from now on are able to distribute their antibody tests.
As of 7 April 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA with an emergency authorisation. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approvals for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies for the virus in blood samples.
The test capacity is several hundred samples in a matter of hours and therefore much faster than conventional viral RNA PCR tests.
Antibodies are usually detected 14 days after the start of the infection. In early April, the United Kingdom considered that none of the acquired antibody test kits were adequate enough to be used.
Hong Kong has organized a system in which suspected patients may stay at home, "the emergency department will give a sample tube to the patient", they must expel saliva in the tube, send it back and get a result soon afterwards. British NHS announced that it is coordinating a system to test suspected cases at home, which eliminates the risk of a patient infecting others if they are at the hospital or the need to disinfect an ambulance if any is used. In the drive-thru tests for COVID-19 in suspicious cases, a health professional collects samples taking appropriate precautions.
Drive-thru centers have helped South Korea carry out some of the fastest and most comprehensive tests in a country. In Germany, the National Association of Health Insurance Medical Officers stated on March 2 that it had capacity for about 12,000 tests per day in outpatient care, with 10,700 being tested the previous week.
The costs are borne by health insurance when the test is requested by a doctor.
According to President Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity for 160,000 tests per week.
Since March 19, drive-in tests have been offered in several large cities.
Since March 26, 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany remains unknown, since only positive tests are recorded.
The first research laboratory revealed that since the 12th week of 2020, a total of 483.295 samples were tested until the 12th week of 2020 and 33,491 samples (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers from the Technion and Rambam hospitals developed and tested a method to test samples of 64 patients simultaneously, gathering the samples and performing additional tests only if the combined sample was considered positive. In Wuhan, an improvised laboratory of 2000 m2 for emergency detection called "Huo-Yan" (China:  cut-off, or "Fire Eye" in English) was opened on 5 February 2020 by BGI, which can process more than 10,000 samples per day.
With the construction supervised by the founder of BGI, Wang Jian, and taking 5 days, the modeling revealed that the cases in Hubei would have been 47% higher and the corresponding cost to deal with quarantine would have doubled if this testing capacity had no online access.
The Wuhan laboratory was promptly followed by Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities throughout China.
On March 4, 2020, the total daily yield was 50,000 tests per day. Multiplexed open-source models released by Origami Assays were launched as able to test up to 1,122 samples of patients for COVID-19 using only 93 tests. These balanced models can be performed in small laboratories without the need for robotic manipulators for liquids.
In March, insufficient reagent scarcity or quantities became an obstacle to mass testing in the European Union, the United Kingdom and the United States.
This led some authors to study the sample preparation protocols that involve the heating of the samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genomes to additional tests. On March 31, it was reported that the United Arab Emirates are now testing more per capita in their population for Coronavirus than other countries, and would be on the way to increase the test level and reach most of the population.
This was achieved by a combination of drive-thru capacity, and acquisition of a mass-scale mass processing laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (inspired by its "Huo-Yan" emergency detection laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is able to conduct tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first in the world to operate outside China.
Different test methods aimed at different components of the coronavirus genetic profile were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted Germany's method of manufacturing kits sent to low-income countries that have no resources to develop their own.
The German method was released on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Disease Control Centre was not available until 28 January, there was a delay in the tests available to the USA and China and the United States faced problems with the reliability of the test kits well at the beginning of the outbreak; moreover, those countries with Australia were unable to provide sufficient kits to meet the demand and recommendations for testing made by health professionals.
On the other hand, experts say that the wide availability of South Korea for testing helped reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
Test capacity, largely in private sector laboratories, has been consolidated over many years by the government of South Korea.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization indicated the strengthening of test programs as the best way to delay the advance of the COVID-19 pandemic. The high demand for tests due to the widespread spread of the virus caused the delay of hundreds of thousands of tests in private U.S. laboratories, and the supply of cotton and chemical reagents was affected.
In March 2020, China reported problems precisely in its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC had "failures"; the government, then, removed the bureaucratic barriers that prevented the particular tests. Spain acquired test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but considered the inaccurate results.
The company explained that the incorrect results could result from a failure in the collection of samples or the incorrect use of kits.
The Minister of Spain stated that he would cancel the kits that generated incorrect results and replace them with a different testing kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic purchased from China generated wrong results. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test kits from China considered imprecise.
Prime Minister Matovic suggested that they would be discarded in the Danube. Ates Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said that Turkey's test kits purchased from China had a "high error rate" and that they would not "use them". The United Kingdom purchased 3.5 million test kits from China, but in early April 2020 it announced that they were not useful.
The test, followed by the quarantine of those who tested positive and the monitoring of those with whom positive people for SARS-CoV-2 had contact, had positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the site of the first death by COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two test stages of the entire population of approximately 3,400 people, with an interval of about ten days.
About half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms, and all discovered cases were placed in quarantine.
With the displacement to the restricted commune, this eliminated new infections completely.
With aggressive contact monitoring, country travel restrictions, testing and quarantine, the Coronavirus pandemic in Singapore in 2020 has advanced much slower than in other developed countries, and without radical restrictions such as the mandatory closure of restaurants and sales establishments.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore began to seriously advise the inhabitants to stay home on March 28, but the schools reopened within the planned after the holidays on March 23.
Many other countries have also managed the pandemic with aggressive contact monitoring, travel restrictions to the country, testing and quarantine, but with less aggressive lockdowns, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study identified that the countries that performed more tests, in relation to the number of deaths, had more lower mortality rates, probably because these countries are more able to detect those with no or little symptom.
WHO recommends that countries which do not have testing capacity and have national laboratories with limited COVID-19 experience send their first five positive samples and the first ten negative samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmatory tests.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the "Positive in % of Tests" column is influenced by the country's testing policy.
A country that tests only people admitted to hospitals will have a higher percentage of positive tests than a country that has tested all citizens, whether they show symptoms or not, the other characteristics are equivalent.
Washing hands (or cleaning hands), also known as hand hygiene, is the act of washing hands in order to remove dirt, fat, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands with soap constantly in certain "critical moments" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted by oro-fetal route.
People may also be infected with respiratory diseases such as flu or a common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e. mucosa).
The five crucial moments during the day when washing the hands with soap is important include: before and after defecation, after cleaning the child's bum or changing diapers, before feeding a child, before meals and before and after preparing the food or handling meat, franc or raw fish.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be hygieneed with ashes. The World Health Organization recommends hand hygiene:
Before, during and after preparing the food.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After changing diapers or cleaning a child who used the bathroom.
After wheezing the nose, coughing or sneezing.
After touching animals, rations or animal discards.
Clinical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before administering medicines or medical care may prevent or minimize the spread of diseases.
The main aim of washing hands is to clean the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that may cause disease) and chemicals that can cause damage or disease.
This is particularly important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Washing hands has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and lowering the infant mortality rate in deliveries made at home.
A 2013 study revealed that best practices for hand washing can cause small improvements in the growth of children under five years of age.
In developed countries, infant mortality rates related to diarrhea and respiratory diseases can be reduced by simply introducing behavioral changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple attitude can reduce the mortality rate of these diseases by almost 50%.
Interventions that promote handwashing can reduce diarrhea episodes by about a third, which is comparable to providing clean water to areas lacking.
48% of reductions in episodes of diarrhea may be associated with washing hands with soap. Washing hands with soap is the most effective and economical way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (IRA), such as automatic behavior performed in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, the main cause of IRA, is the first cause of mortality among children under five years of age, taking the lives of estimated 1.8 million children per year.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia together are responsible for nearly 3.5 million deaths of children annually.
According to UNICEF, transforming handwashing with soap before eating and after using the bathroom in a rooted habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, reducing diarrhea deaths by almost half and deaths of acute respiratory infections in one room.
Washing hands is usually associated with other sanitary interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene facilities (WASH).
Washing hands also protects against the impetigo that is transmitted by direct physical contact.
A less significant negative effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing may cause skin injury due to skin drying.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive handwashing can cause a condition of dissection and irritation in the skin known as eczema or hand dermatitis, which is particularly common among health system workers.
Frequent handwashing is also perceived as one of the symptoms of compulsive obsessive disorder (TOC).
There are five crucial moments during the day when washing the hands with soap is important to reduce the fecal-oral transmission of diseases: after using the bathroom (mixion, defecation), after cleaning the bum of a child (change diapers), before feeding a child, before eating and before/after preparing a food or handling raw meat, fish or chicken.
Other situations where the right hand washing technique should be practiced in order to prevent transmission of diseases include before and after treatment of a cut or wound; after sneezing, coughing or wheezing the nose; after touching animal waste or dealing with animals; and after touching trash.
In many countries, there is a reduced rate of washing of hands with soap.
A study on handwashing in 54 countries in 2015 found that, on average, 38.7% of families had the habit of washing their hands with soap. A 2014 study revealed that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of 97 percent; the United States near the average of 77 percent; and China with the lowest rate of 23 percent. Several methods for behavior changes currently exist to increase acceptance of the habit of washing their hands with soap in critical periods. Collective handwashing for children in schools at certain periods of the day is an alternative in developing countries to induce handwashing in children's habits.
The " Essential Health Services Program" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of a large-scale action to promote the health and education of children.
The decay twice a year, complemented by the washing of hands daily with soap, the brushing of teeth daily with fluoride, are at the heart of this national program.
It was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from the skin is reinforced by adding soaps and detergents to the water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce barriers to the solution, and to increase solubility.
The water alone is an ineffective cleaning agent for the skin, because fats and proteins, organic dirt components, are not easily dissolved in water.
Cleaning is, however, facilitated by a reasonable flow of water...
Bar soap, depending on its reusable nature, may retain accumulated bacteria from previous uses.
A small number of studies that analyzed the bacterial transmission of a contaminated bar soap concluded that transmission is unlikely since bacteria are rinsed with foam.
The CDC repeats "liquid soap with automatic dosing commands is preferable".
Antibacterial soaps were widely disseminated to the conscious public in terms of health.
So far, there is no evidence that using recommended antiseptics or disinfectants can lead to the selection of organisms resistant to antibiotics in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of resistant strains of organisms.
Thus, although strains resistant to antibiotics are not selected by antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as they are disseminated.
In addition to surfactants and skin protection agents, complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as a pH regulator, active benzoic acid antimicrobial and other moisturizers for the skin (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis of the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that common soaps are as effective in preventing diseases and removing bacteria from the hands as antibacterial soaps aimed at the end consumer containing triclosan.
Hot water that is comfortable for washing hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow faster at body temperature (37 oC).
However, hot water with soap is more effective than cold water with soap to remove natural oil that retains dirt and bacteria.
Unlike popular belief, however, scientific studies have revealed that using hot water is not effective to reduce the microbial load in the hands.
A hand hygienizer or antiseptic is a non-aqueous base hand hygiene agent.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-alcohol-based base hand hygiene agents (also known as alcohol-based hand hygiene product, antiseptic hand hygiene product, or hand hygiene) began to gain popularity.
Most are made from isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated with a thickening agent, such as carbomer (polymer or acrylic acid), gel, or a moisturizer, such as glycerin, liquid, or foam to facilitate the use and reduce the effect of alcohol drying.
The addition of hydrogen peroxide increases antimicrobial activity. Hand hygieneers containing a minimum of 60 to 95% alcohol kill germs efficiently.
Alcohol-based hygienizers kill bacteria, multi-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccination, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol-based hygienizers containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% (decrease of 3.5 logarithms, similar to the reduction of 35 decibels) of bacteria in the hands, 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (reduction of 4 to 5 logarithms) of bacteria in the hands 1 minute after application. Hand hygienizers are more effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand hygieneers are almost totally ineffective against the norovirus (or Norwalk) virus, the most common cause of contagious gastroenteritis. Antiseptics for alcohol-based hands or hygienics can be used to moisturize or cover both hands well.
The backs and palms of the hands, between the fingers and their extremities, are rubbed for approximately 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is dry.
The fingertips should also be well washed, being rubbed with the two palms. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing with hand hygiene, especially when hands are visually dirty.
The increasing use of these agents is based on its ease of use and rapid exterminating action against microorganisms; however, they should not replace the appropriate hand washing unless soap and water are not available.
The frequent use of alcohol-based hand hygieneers may cause skin drying unless emollients and/or skin moisturizers are added to the formula.
The effect of alcohol drying may be reduced or eliminated by the addition of glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand hygienizers containing emollients caused substantially less irritation and skin drying than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or alcohol hypersensitivity or additives present in the hand hygieneers of alcohol-based hands rarely occur.
The lower tendency to provoke irritative contact dermatitis has become an attractive one compared to washing hands with water and soap.
Despite its effectiveness, non-aqueous base agents do not clean the hands of organic matter, they only disinfect them.
That is why hand hygienizers are not as effective as water and soap for the prevention of the spread of many pathogens, since pathogens are still in their hands.
The effectiveness of hand sanitizers without alcohol is extremely dependent on substances and formulation, and historically it has been much out of alcohol and alcohol-based hygienizers.
More recently, formulations using benzalconium chloride revealed continuous and cumulative antimicrobial action after application, unlike alcohol, which revealed reduced efficacy after recurrent use, probably due to the increasing adverse reactions in the skin.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford a soap and instead use ash or land.
Grey or soil may be more effective than pure water, but may be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if soil or ash are contaminated with microorganisms the spread of the disease may increase rather than decrease.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant agent, since in contact with water it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends ash and sand as an alternative to soap when there is no soap.
The correct hand washing technique recommended by the US Disease Control Centre to prevent disease transmission includes the following steps:
Wash your hands with cold or hot running water.
It is recommended that running water since fixed washbasins may be contaminated, while the water temperature does not appear to be relevant.
Wash your hands, frying them with a generous amount of soap, including the backs of your hands, the space between your fingers and under your nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies reveal that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when used soap instead of pure water.
Sweep for at least 20 seconds.
The act of rubbing generates friction, which helps to remove the germs from the skin, and rub for a longer time removes more germs.
Wash well with running water.
Washing on a sink can recontaminate your hands.
Dry with a dry towel or let it dry in the open air.
Wet or wet hands are more easily recontaminated. The most commonly forgotten areas are thumb, pulse, finger and nail areas.
Artificial and lacquered glazes can shelter microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotion is often recommended to keep hands hydrated; dry skin can cause skin lesions that can increase the risk of transmission of infection.
Several low cost options can be made to facilitate hand washing where there is no running water and/or soap, for example, to pour water from a gallon or cabbage with appropriate holes and/or use ash if necessary in developing countries. In situations with restricted water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to store water such as "improved towers" and other low cost options.
An improvised tap is a simple technology that uses a jar suspended by a rope, and a lever powered by the feet to clear a small amount of water into the hands and a soap bar.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is a discussion about the most effective form for drying in public bathrooms.
An increasing volume of research suggests that towels are much more hygienic than electric hand dryers found in many bathrooms.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and sponsored by the European Tissue Symposium paper industry, to compare the levels of hygiene presented by the towel paper, hand dryers with heated air and the most modern hand dryers with air jet.
After washing and drying hands with a heated air dryer, the total number of bacteria was considered, on average, 194% higher in the palm area near the fingers and 254% in the rest of the palm.
Drying with air jet dryers caused an increase in the total number of bacteria, on average, of 42% in the palm area near the fingers and about 15% in the rest of the palm.
After washing and drying hands with towel paper, the total number of bacteria was reduced, on average, by up to 76% in the palm area near the fingers and up to 77% in the rest of the palm. Researchers also conducted tests to determine whether there was potential for cross-contamination among other users and the bathroom environment as a consequence of each type of drying method.
The air jet dryer, which projects air out of the unit at indicated speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), managed to expel microorganisms from the hands and the unit potentially contaminating other bathroom users and the environment up to 2 meters away.
The use of hot-air hand dryers spread microorganisms to up to 0.25 meters of the dryer.
The towel papers did not present a significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Product and Umwelt, different methods for hand drying were evaluated.
The following changes in bacterial count after hand drying were observed:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryers were compared to drying with towel paper.
Washing hands with wet hand-cleaning sheets is an alternative to the lack of soap and water during travel.
Alcohol-based hand hygienizers must contain at least 60% alcohol.
The clinical handwashing became mandatory long after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its efficacy (in 1846) in the prevention of diseases in the hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind the hospital team of washing their hands when they forget.
One study found that infection rates decreased with their use.
The clinical washing of hands is for a minimum of 15 seconds, using generous amounts of soap and water or gel to savor and rub all parts of the hands.
The hands should be rubbed simultaneously with the interlacing of the fingers.
If there are residues under the nails, a brush can be used to remove them.
As germs can remain in the water in their hands, it is important to rinse well and dry with a clean towel.
After drying, the towel paper should be used to close the tap (and open the door if necessary).
This prevents recontamination of hands by these surfaces.
The aim of hand washing in the medical care environment is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and to avoid transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the lack of hand washing remains at unacceptable levels in most medical environments, with a large number of doctors and nurses constantly forgetting to wash their hands before touching the patients, thus transmitting microorganisms.
One study revealed that adequate hand washing and other simple procedures may reduce the rate of infection in the bloodstream related to catheter by 66 percent. The World Health Organization published a bulletin demonstrating the pattern of hand washing and friction in the health system sectors.
The project of orientation for the hygiene of the hands of the organization can also be found on this website for comments.
An applicable review was carried out by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices may measure and validate the hygiene of the hands if the demonstration of regulatory conformity is required.
The World Health Organization defines "Five moments" for hand washing:
after exposure to body/blood fluids
before an ascetic task, and
after patient care. The addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap (medicinal or antimicrobial soaps) confers an exterminating action to a hand washing agent.
Such exterminating action may be desirable before performing surgery or in situations in which antibiotic resistant organisms are predominant. To "clean" hands for a surgical operation it is necessary to have a tap that can be opened and closed without touching it with the hands, some chlorhexidine or iodine antiseptics, sterilized towels to dry hands after washing, and a sterilized brush for cleaning and other sterilized instruments for cleaning under the nails.
All jewels must be removed.
This procedure requires hand washing and forearms up to elbows, usually 2-6 minutes.
A very long cleaning time (10 minutes) is not necessary.
At the time of washing, the water in the forearms should not flow into the hands.
After handwashing is finished, the hands are sunk with a sterilized towel and the surgical jacket is dressed.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for your hands before and after caring for a sick person.
For the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that there was a greater benefit of hand cleaning in the first 20% washing, and an additional little benefit was obtained when the cleaning frequency exceeded 35%.
Washing with common soap more than triples the rate of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted for food compared to washing with an antibacterial soap. Comparing hand hygiene with an alcohol-based solution with washing of hands with an antibacterial soap for an average time of 30 seconds for each revealed that the hand hygieneer of alcohol-based hands reduced bacterial contamination by 26% more than an antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are more effective than hand hygienics based on alcohol to reduce influenza A virus, H1N1, and Clostridium spores difficult in hands. Interventions to increase hand hygiene in hospital environments may involve the team's awareness of hand washing, increased availability of hand hygienics based on alcohol, and verbal and written warnings to the team.
There is a need for more research on which interventions are more efficient in different health establishments.
In developing countries, washing hands with soap is considered an essentially economically viable tool for good health and even better nutrition.
However, the absence of reliable sources of water, soap or resources for washing hands in people's homes, schools and workplaces makes this a challenge for the achievement of universal practice of hand washing.
For example, in most rural Africa the taps for washing hands close to any public or private bathrooms are rare, although there are cheap options for the construction of hand washing stations.
However, low hand washing rates may instead be the result of rooted habits and not the lack of soap and water.
The incentive and defense of washing hands with soap can influence political decisions, lead to awareness of the benefits of washing hands and cause a change in long-term behavior of the population.
For this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation are necessary.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches are effective for increasing hand-washing in low- and middle-income countries, while social marketing campaigns are less efficient. An example for promoting hand-washing in schools is UNICEF's "Three-Star Approach" that encourages schools to take simple and cheap steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene requirements.
When a minimum level is reached, schools can go from one to the three maximum stars.
The construction of hand-washing stations may be part of the promotion campaigns for hand-washing carried out in order to reduce diseases and infant mortality.
The world's day for handwashing is another example of awareness campaign that tries to achieve a change of habit. As a result of the 2019-2020 coronary artery pandemic, UNICEF released the adoption of an emoji for handwashing.
Few studies have considered the overall cost/benefit ratio of hand washing in developing countries in relation to classification in DALY.
However, an analysis suggests that promoting washing of hands with soap is significantly more profitable than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing for human health — especially for people in vulnerable circumstances as mothers who had just given birth or soldiers injured in hospitals — was initially recognized in the mid-19th century by two precursors of hand hygiene: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the English "founder of modern nursing".
At that time, people still believed that infections were caused by unpleasant smells called miasmas.
In the 1980s, outbreaks of food origin and infections associated with health care led the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention to encourage more actively hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infections.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 led to an increase in awareness in many countries of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect themselves from such infectious diseases.
For example, posters with "technical for the appropriate washing of hands" were hung close to sinks for washing of hands in public bathrooms and in toilets of office buildings and airports in Germany.
The expression "washing hands" means declaring reluctance to take responsibility or to be constipated with something.
It originated from the biblical passage in Matthew, where Pontius Pilate washed the hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but became a more general phrase of use in some English communities.
In Macbeth of Shakespeare, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands compulsively in an attempt to cleanse an imaginary stain, representing her guilty conscience regarding the crimes she had committed and led her husband to commit.
It was also found that people, after remembering or witnessing antiethical acts, tend to wash their hands more often than others, and usually give more importance to hand washing equipment.
Furthermore, those who can wash their hands after such vision are less likely to perform other compensatory acts of "cleanness", such as volunteering.
Religions prescribe the washing of hands for hygienic and symbolic purposes. The symbolic washing of hands, using water, but not soap, to wash hands is part of a ritual washing of hands characteristic in many religions, including Bahá'í faith, Hinduism, Tevilah and Netilat Yadayim in Judaism, washbasin in Christianity, and ablution in Islamism. Religions also indicate the hygienic washing of hands, especially after some actions.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam allow handwashing after use of the bathroom.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Islam allow the washing of hands before and after meals.
Hazard controls at the workplace for COVID-19
Hazard controls at work for COVID-19 are the application of health and safety methodologies at work for hazard controls for the prevention of 2019 coronary disease (COVID-19).
The appropriate hazard controls at the workplace depend on the workplace and the work itself, based on the risk assessment of the sources of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community, and the risk factors of individual workers, which may be vulnerable to the contraction of COVID-19.
According to the Department of Health and Safety at Work (OSHA), functions at lower risk of exposure have minimal occupational contact with the public and other colleagues, for which basic measures of prevention of infection are recommended, including hand washing, encouraging employees to stay home if they are sick, maintain a respiratory label and a routine of cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
Functions with average exposure risk include those that require frequent or direct contact with people who are not known to be contaminated or suspected of being contaminated by COVID-19, but may be infected due to the current Community transmission or because they have traveled abroad.
This includes workers who maintain contact with the general public as in schools, working environments of high population density, and in the retail market of large volumes.
The hazard controls for this group, in addition to the basic measures of prevention of infection, include ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, protective coverings and the provision of individual protective equipment if a person is confirmed with COVID-19.
OSHA considers that health system and necroteria workers who are exposed to persons with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 are at high risk of exposure, which increases the risk of exposure to very high if workers perform procedures in persons with confirmed COVID-19 or suspected aerosol generation and collect or handle specimens of these people.
Adequate hazard controls for these workers include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and individual protection equipment suitable for the work performed.
The COVID-19 epidemic can have several effects on the workplace.
Workers may leave work because they become sick, because they have to take care of other people or because of fear of possible exposure.
Trade patterns can change, both in terms of which products are in demand and the means of purchasing these products (such as making purchases out of peak times or by delivery or drive-thru services.
Finally, sending items from areas seriously affected by COVID-19 can be interrupted. An action plan and preparation for infectious disease can be used to guide protective actions.
The plans address the risk levels associated with various workplaces and tasks, including sources of exposure, risk factors that arise at home and in the community, and risk factors of individual workers such as advanced age or chronic medical conditions.
They also define the controls necessary to address these risks, and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of epidemics.
Action plans and preparation for infectious diseases may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
The objectives for action for an epidemic include reducing transmission among employees, protecting people at greater risk of developing health complications, maintaining business operations and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community, where the company is located, affects the actions taken.
The hierarchy of hazard controls is a widely used structure in occupational health and safety to group hazard controls by efficacy.
When the dangers of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls and finally individual protective equipment.
Engineering controls involve the isolation of employees from work-related hazards without relying on the behaviour of the worker, and may be the most economical implementation solution.
Engineering controls are changes in the work policy or procedures that require the action of the worker or employer.
Individual protection equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can help prevent certain exposures.
All types of PPE shall be selected on the basis of the hazard to the worker, properly adjusted as necessary (e.g. respirators), used appropriately and continuously, inspected regularly, stored and replaced as necessary, and removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of properly to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Department of Labour Health and Safety (OSHA), works with low risk of exposure have minimal occupational contact with the public and other colleagues.
Basic measures of prevention of infection recommended for all workplaces include frequent and meticulous handwashing, encouragement for workers to stay home if they are sick and use the respiratory label, including sneezing and coughing, preparation of canvas containers and for common trash, preparation for telework or staggered shifts, if necessary, disincentive of the use of tools and equipment from other workers and maintenance of a routine of cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
The rapid identification and isolation of potentially infected individuals is an essential step in the protection of workers, customers, visitors and other people at work.
The U.S. Disease Control and Prevention Centre (CDC) recommends that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory disease stay at home until they have no more fever, signs of fever or any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without medication to reduce fever or relief from other symptoms, and also recommends that sick leave policies be flexible, allow employees to stay home to care for a sick member of the family, and that they have knowledge of these policies.
According to OSHA, studies with average exposure risk include those that require frequent or direct contact of 6 feet (1,8 m) with people who are not known whether they are confirmed patients or suspects with COVID-19, but may be infected by SARS-CoV-2 due to the current community transmission in the company's locality, or because the individual has a recent history of travelling abroad, in a country with high transmission of COVID-19.
These include workers who have contact with the general public as well as in schools, high-density working environments and some retail stores of high volume sales. Engineering controls for this group and for higher-risk groups include the installation of high-efficiency air filters, increased ventilation, installation of physical barriers, such as transparent plastic hygienic forearms and the installation of a drive-thru window for customer service. Administrative controls for this group and higher-risk groups include the incentive for workers to stay at home, replacement of face-to-face meetings by virtual communication, the establishment of staggered shifts, the cancellation of non-essential trips to locations with current COVID-19 epidemic, the development of communication plans, including a forum to answer workers' doubts, the provision of training and instruction on the risk factors and protective practices against COVID-19, the training of workers who are required to use individual and protective equipment, with the provision of personal protection, the provision of resources and the provision of constant hygiene.
Workers in this risk group rarely need respirators.
If a person becomes ill on a plane, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include the isolation of the sick person from the other persons for a distance of 6 feet, with the designation of a crew member to serve the sick person and offer it a facial mask, or ask the sick person to cover his or her mouth and nose with coughing or sneezing sheets.
The crew shall use disposable medical gloves when serving a sick passenger or touching body fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces and possibly additional personal protective equipment if the patient has fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing.
Luves and other disposable items should be disposed of in a bag for biological waste, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected thereafter. For commercial transport, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, hazard controls include the postponement of the journey by the patient passenger, self-insulation and immediate communication to the medical center on board if someone shows fever or other symptoms during the trip.
The ideal is that there is medical follow-up in the cabin of the isolated person. For schools and childcare centers, the CDC recommends temporary closure for cleaning and disinfection if an infected person was present in the building, regardless of the spread of the virus in the community.
When there is minimal to moderate community transmission, social distancing strategies can be implemented, such as cancellation of field trips, assemblies, and other large groupings such as physical or coral education classes, or meals in a lanchonet, increasing the space between tables, arrival times and more rigid departures, limitation of non-essential visitors and use of a separate health care site for children with flu symptoms.
When there is significant transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, prolonged dispensations from the school can be considered. For law enforcement authorities performing daily activities, the risk to immediate health is considered low by the CDC.
It is recommended that police officers contact individuals with suspected COVID-19 or confirmed disease follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including the use of appropriate personal protective equipment.
If direct contact occurs during seizure, workers must clean and disinfect their belt and other accessories before using them again using a common household cleaning spray or cloth and follow the standard operating procedures for the containment and disposition of PPE used and for the containment and washing of clothing.
OSHA considers certain health workers and necroteria as being in high or very high exposure risk categories.
High exposure risk functions include medical, laboratory and medical care delivery workers, who are exposed to patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19.
The risk of exposure becomes very high if workers perform aerosol generation procedures in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, or collect or handle specimens of these patients.
Aerosol generation procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations or invasive specimen collection.
Works in high exposure necrotories include workers involved in the preparation of bodies of persons with confirmed COVID-19 or suspected of the disease at the time of their death; the risk of exposure becomes very high if they perform autopsy. Additional engineering controls for these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with confirmed COVID-19 or suspected of the disease, including when aerosol generator procedures are performed.
Specialized ventilation of negative pressure may be appropriate in some necroteria scenarios and in the health area.
Samples should be handled with caution of level 3 biosafety.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients who enter the hospital be separated into two distinct waiting areas depending on whether they are a suspected case for COVID-19. In addition to other EPIs, the OSHA recommends respirators for professionals who work at a distance of 6 feet of patients with confirmation or suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and for professionals who perform aerosol generation procedures.
In the United States, facial respirators with N95 particle filtering, approved by NIOSH or superior quality respirators should be used in the context of a comprehensive and written respiratory protection program that includes adjustment tests, training and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide protection and improve the worker's comfort. WHO does not recommend the use of macacons, since COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, and is not transmitted by non-respiratory body fluids.
WHO recommends only one surgical mask for screening staff at the point of entry.
For professionals who collect respiratory specimens, treat or transport patients with COVID-19 without aerosol generation procedures, WHO recommends a surgical mask, protective glasses or facial protection, surgical apron and gloves.
If an aerosol generation procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced by an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Since the overall provision of EPIS is insufficient, WHO recommends minimization of the need for EPIS through telemedicine, physical barriers such as clear windows, allowing only those involved in direct care to patients to enter a comfortable room with a patient with COVID-19, using only the PPE necessary for the specific task, continuous use of the same respirator without removing it while dealing with several patients with the same diagnosis, monitor and coordinate the PPE supply chain and discourage the use of masks by asymptomatic individuals.

LICENCE: CC0: No rights reserved
We are in unusual circumstances this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is something that makes clear our global human interconnection and the responsibilities we have towards the other.
Their challenges have no precedent, but we know that our best actions go hand in hand with global empathy, cooperation and the creation of communities, which are the foundations of this organization.
The companionship and concern we have seen among all our colleagues through e-mails, connections and conversations is a remarkable validation of the incredible human beings with whom we have the privilege of working.
I am immensely grateful and proud to have all of you as colleagues.
Last week, someone shared with me their recognition for our work.
That person reminded me of how significant it is for the world to be able to access Wikipedia now, and how powerful a symbol that this essential resource continues online and available to everyone.
The work of you makes this possible, because you keep the workplaces active, pay our colleagues and maintain the security of our communities.
The world needs information that Wikipedia provides, more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do, but the way we do it will have a significant impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and its role in it, we will make important adjustments to the way we work together, starting next week.
Adjustments to our work and times
As Robyn mentioned earlier, team C met last night to discuss our approach and times for the next few days and months.
At this meeting, we consider what we think is an appropriate action to what we are experiencing and the best way to maintain sustainable organization in this period.
We want to end stress and support our mission in the long run.
If you need to stay away for a while, it doesn't matter.
For all employees, service providers and contract workers:
our daily expectation of work will be 4 hours, or 20 hours weekly, until otherwise arranged.
We are not declaring a holiday. If you can work at normal time, it may be useful for our mission.
However, the world is unpredictable now, and if you need to take care of loved ones, buy food or go to the doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We're not monitoring your schedules.
If you're sick, don't work.
That rule would not even need to be expressed, but we decided to declare it.
It is not necessary to attest or strike paid. Just inform your manager to help your team review the schedule and schedules to ensure that key areas of work are served.
(If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, inform Bryan of the training and certification sector so that his sector can help you and ensure that your situation receives appropriate management attention).
Staff working hourly will receive full payment.
We've said that before, and we're committed to honouring our commitment to our contractors and employees who work hourly.
All will receive their salaries on the basis of their normal work file under normal circumstances.
Wages are independent if you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we give you full support.
Many people see work as a way to channel stress due to the current situation in the world.
The work we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in times like these.
Remembering that your well-being is more important.
We just ask you to communicate with your manager, so we know what to expect and can help activities properly.
Some functions are considered essential.
There are activities that we must continue to perform.
Sites, HR, Reliability and Security and Fund Anger Teams (among others) carry out essential activities that may require additional support.
We will start a process with all departments to evaluate current objectives and change our focus to support what is essential to our mission.
There is much to be done for all of us, and we will focus our efforts on the most essential projects.
To slow down now will not harm us in the future.
We don't intend to "work folded to recover lost time" after the pandemic is over.
You will not be expected to work overtime to meet deadlines that are now impractical.
We accept that circumstances have changed, and we will work to define new goals and deadlines as appropriate.
What will happen to the annual planning?
To adjust to our new reality and expectations of hours worked daily, we intend to adjust the schedule for the delivery of our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan, which will provide a longer time for the budget, and that employees prioritize the essential work, personal care and care of loved ones, while we accommodate those who need or want to work on a reduced journey in the coming weeks.
The length of the schedule greatly reduces the workloads of current planning and pressure throughout the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Board next week and update representatives and teams on the next steps as soon as we have confirmation.
We thank the annual planning team for their leadership in this process.
Status, exhibition and office cleaning
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues in San Francisco might have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
In view of this situation, we employ an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces in the office of San Francisco.
They used a special antiviral solution for hospitals to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the entrance hall and all elevators that give access to our floor.
The building is using its own protocol of care duties using products that are safe for its visitors.
We are relieved that the office will be properly prepared for when we decide to return.
Our office in Washington is located in a WeWork, which shared its protocol to the COVID-19 with us and with all Washington officials.
Last week, our office in Washington moved to a totally remote configuration, in line with the guide shared with San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we are also discussing the rental of an office in Brooklyn.
These discussions continue to take place, but they may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who have worked remotely for a long time know that it can be an adjustment, and they would like to offer some advice:
They limit the duration of the meetings to no more than one or two hours.
If longer sessions are necessary, consider dividing them in several days.
They define the meeting, have a schedule and send materials for reading in advance.
Use the videos as default, with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate real-time collaboration and connection.
Have a leader to facilitate meetings, someone who monitors questions in the chat and list of participants, and someone to help make notes (or collaborative notes).
Send an email to technical support if you need comfortable earphones.
They use their emergency aid to buy snacks.
Join the #remote channel to talk to your colleagues about remote work
The HR operations team is researching ergonomic guides in the context of webinar to assist in the increase of remote work in the Foundation.
Last week, we asked all community aid recipients to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as the edition marathons, until WHO declared the end of the pandemic.
We warned them that we understood that our request for cancellation and other restrictions could make it impossible to complete their agreed grant activities, and that no one would be penalized for extending or modifying their goals.
Next week, we will continue with additional guides on Wikimania and other regional and thematic conferences for the community.
The general feeling in the world community seems to be of sadness with paralysis, but also of relief with the clarity and ability to maintain focus on their own communities, Wikimedia and other situations.
The communication resources team is working on creating a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and receive our communications to it.
Keeping up-to-date on COVID-19-related issues
We will send an invitation to your calendars for next Thursday at 14:00 UTC/ 07:00 PT for a special meeting with employees.
We will use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions and spend some time connecting with each other.
We're in this together and we'll help with whatever it takes.
Meanwhile, you can continue to find the information of this email and all other information related to COVID-19 on the company's wiki.
The communication resources team will update these pages and all information in a single location.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with employees who live in countries significantly affected today.
If you have any questions about travel, events, a main workflow, or about the coverage challenge, or anything else you might need help with, do not stop notifying and working with the communication resources team.
We are here to help provide support and collaboration as necessary.
If you have a confidential or sensitive subject, email Bryan Juden, Director of Global HR Operations.
None of these changes should be seen as abandonment of our work and obligations.
They are, however, a recognition that at this moment our work and obligations will probably need to be adapted in a way that we do not adapt in the past.
These are the steps we believe are necessary as support at this time, so that we can continue working, providing our movement with the support they need and providing the world with the service it depends on.
Our planned work will be waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it is time to support each other and create space for the important work that will be done in the weeks, and probably months later.
We need all of you to make this happen, so we need everyone to take care of you and your family so that they are in their best condition when necessary.
Wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, communications resources team (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S), and the rest of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
The converting enzyme of type 2 angiotensin (ECA2) is an enzyme coupled to the outer surface (cell membranes) of the cells of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney, and intestines.
ECA2 neutralizes the activity of the related angiotensin converting enzyme (ECA) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and raising Ang (1-7), becoming a promising drug directed to the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ECA2 also works as a point of entry into the cells for some coronary virus.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hECA2.
The angiotensin converting enzyme type 2 is a metaloenzyme containing zinc located on the endothelial surface and other cells.
ECA2 contains a peptide domain M2 N-terminal and a C-terminal domain transporter of amino acids and collectrin in the renal system.
ECA2 is a single-passenger membrane protein of type 1 with its enzymeally active domain exposed to the surface of the cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ECA2 is cleavated from the domain of the transmembrane by another enzyme known as sheddase, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and finally excreted into the urine.
ECA2 is present in many organs: ECA2 is coupled to the cell membrane of the main pulmonary alveolar cells of type II, small intestine enterocytes, arterial and venous endothelial cells and smooth arterial muscle cells in most organs.
The expression of ECA2 mRNA is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brain trunk.
The main function of ECA2 is to act as a counterweight for ECA.
ACE cleaves type I angiotensin hormone into type II angiotensin causing vasoconstriction.
ECA2 in turn cliques carboxterminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysis in vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-Gist-Pro-OH).
ECA2 also cleaves several other peptides, including [des-Arg9]- bradycinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and greline.
ECA2 also regulates the transport by the membrane of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and was involved in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ECA2 works as the main cell entry point for some coronary artery viruses, including HCOV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus causing SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus causing COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 Spike S1 protein to the enzymatic domain of ECA2 on the cell surface results in endocytosis and translocation of the virus and enzyme into endosomous cells located inside the cells.
This entry process also requires the preparation of S protein by the serine-protease host TMPRSS2, whose inhibition is under investigation as a potential therapy. This led some to raise the hypothesis that reducing ECA2 levels in cells, perhaps helping in the fight against infection.
However, several professional societies and regulators recommended continuing with the ACE inhibitor pattern and ARB therapy.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012 found that "the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to controls".
Moreover, "the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who presented a high risk of contracting pneumonia, especially those with CVA and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with reduced pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less robust than for the overall risk of pneumonia".
It is believed that recombinant human ECA2 (rhACE2) is a new therapy for acute lung injury, and it seemed to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with an acute respiratory distress syndrome induced by lipopolissaccharide.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the start of the action is 30 minutes after the temporal evolution of 24 hour effects (duration).
Many findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising medicine for those with intolerance to classical renin-angiotensin inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases in which angiotensin II in circulation is high. Infused rhACE2 was evaluated in clinical tests for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
COVID-19 applications are mobile software applications to help monitoring in response to the 2019-2020 coronary artery pandemic, i.e., the process of identifying people ("contacts") that may have come into contact with infected individuals.
Numerous applications were developed or proposed, with official government support in some territories and jurisdictions.
Several structures to create contact monitoring applications have been developed.
Privacy issues were raised, especially on systems based on tracking the geographic location of the application users.
Less intrusive alternatives include the use of Bluetooth signals to record the user's proximity to other cell phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate the functionality to support such Bluetooth-based applications directly to their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, together with Alipay, implemented an application that allows citizens to verify whether they were in contact with a person with COVID-19.
It is in use in over 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, an app called TraceTogether is being used.
The app was developed by the local IT community, released as open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia launched the "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth-based application to track exposure to potentially infected people and provide a quick response to health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
Since April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting approval by Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government declared that the contact tracking application was in advanced development stage, and would be available for distribution in weeks. A similar application is expected for Ireland, and for France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand provide applications based on the TraceTogether application in Singapore and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to implement a geographical delimitation application for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 living in Moscow, designed to ensure that they do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, listed a number of potential practical problems with application-based systems, including false positives and the potential lack of effectiveness if acceptance of the application is limited to only a small portion of the population.
In response to concerns about the dissemination of fake or harmful "coronavirus" applications, Apple sets limits for types of organizations that can add coronavirus-related applications to its App Store, limiting them only to "official" or otherwise respected organizations.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy defenders expressed concern about the implications of mass surveillance using coronavirus applications, especially about whether the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be dismantled when the threat has passed.
Anistia International and more than 100 other organizations issued a communiqué requesting limits for this type of surveillance.
The organizations declared eight conditions for government projects:
surveillance should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
extension of monitoring and surveillance should have suspension clauses;
the use of data should be limited for the purposes of COVID-19;
the safety and anonymity of the data should be protected and presented as evidence-based protection;
digital surveillance should avoid aggravating discrimination and marginalisation;
any data sharing with third parties should be provided for in law;
there should be safeguards against abuse and the rights of citizens to respond to abuse;
the significant participation of all "relevant stakeholders" would be required, including that of public health experts and marginalized groups. Chaos Computer Club (CCC) of Germany and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter own Grenzen) (RSF) also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to deal with the problem of persistent surveillance by removing the tracking mechanism from its operating device systems when it is no longer necessary.
Some countries have used network-based tracking rather than applications, eliminating the need to download an application and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to gross localization data have considerable potential privacy problems.
However, not all systems with central servers need access to personal location data; a number of systems that preserve privacy were created to use central servers only for intercommunication (see section below).
In South Korea, an application-based non-application system was used to run the contact tracking.
Instead of using an exclusive application, the system gathered tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, combining them to generate warnings via text messages to potentially infected individuals.
In addition to using this information to alert potential stakeholders, the government also made location information publicly available, which is permitted due to comprehensive changes to the confidentiality laws of information after the outbreak of MERS in the country.
This information is available to the public through a series of applications and websites. Countries, including Germany, consider using both the privacy preservation system and the centralised one.
By 6 April 2020 the details had not yet been disclosed.
The contact tracking preserving privacy is a well-defined concept, with a significant body of scientific bibliography dating back to, at least, 2013. Since April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups have been working on privacy-respecting solutions, using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to record the proximity of a user to other mobile devices.
However, the PEPP-PT is a coordination effort that covers centralized and decentralized approaches, and is not a single protocol. The decentralized protocols include the Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, fka Contact Event Numbers, CEN) Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracing (PACT) and others.
In these protocols, identifiable personal data never emerge from the device, and any combination is made on the device.
The Privacy Group at the MIT Media Lab has developed Safe Paths, a platform for the use of privacy preservation techniques during collection and use of localization data or crossing routes to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on the research from the technical publication "Applicatives play dirty: keeping personal privacy in an epidemic" released in March 2020. Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform of the Enigma MPC, an undertaking that develops privacy technologies and originally founded at the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive localization and health data with other users and managers, without compromising the privacy of these data.
On 5 April 2020, the TCN Global Coalition was founded by groups that joined around what was essentially the same approach and largely with overlap of protocols, with the aim of reducing fragmentation, and allowing the overall interoperability of alert and tracking applications, a key aspect of the achievement of widespread adoption.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that the BlueTrace protocol, used by the official government application, became open-source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, companies that control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative for contact tracking, in which they claimed that they would preserve privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and encryption for privacy preservation.
They also published specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system foresees implementation in three stages:
development of tools to enable the government to create official coronavirus tracking applications preserving privacy
integration of this feature directly into iOS and Android; Google and Apple plan to face persistent and assumed surveillance problems by first distributing the system by system updates in operation, and later removing it in the same way as the threat ends.
Drug repositioning (also known as drug reposition, reperfilation, reassignment or therapeutic replacement) is the reposition of an approved drug for the treatment of a medical condition or disease different from that for which it was originally developed.
This is one of the lines of scientific research that are currently being adopted to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research directions include the development of a convalescent plasma transfusion and vaccine to COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 drug proteins, each with multiple binding points.
Analyzing these binding points provides the reasonable project for the development of effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important target proteins in SARS-CoV-2 are papaine-like protease, RNA polymerase dependent on RNA, helicase, protein S and ADP ribophosphatase.
Hussein A. A., et al. studied several candidate compounds that later improved and analyzed for their structural similarities with the most similar approved drugs in order to accelerate the development of a potent drug against SARS-CoV-2 in its preclinical study to be recommended for a clinical study design.
Chloroquin is a malaria drug that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs studied as part of the Solidarity clinical trial.
The Governor of New York Andrew Cuomo announced that the tests with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in the state of New York would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulphate and chloroquine phosphate by means of an Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA).
Treatment was not approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorised through EUA only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients who cannot receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC said that "the use, dosage or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2" infection are not yet established.
Doctors said they're using the drug when "there's no other option."
In Istanbul, a Turkish research team is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Major studies are underway at Duke University and Oxford University.
The NYU Langone School of Medicine is conducting a trial on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed to demonstrate that favipiravir was "clearly effective".
In Shenzhen, 35 patients tested negative within 4 days on average, while the duration of the disease in the 45 patients who did not receive it was 11 days.
In a study conducted in Wuhan with 240 patients with pneumonia, half was treated with favipiravir, and half received umifenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Agency reminded the population that the existing evidence for embassing the medicine is scarce and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy Japan's medicine to store it and use the army to deliver it to university hospitals, where it would be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has created openings for Trump administration on the purchase of the medicine. The medicine may be less effective in serious cases of the disease when the virus has already multiplied.
Its use may not be safe for pregnant women or women trying to become pregnant.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir antivirals, concluded that "no benefit has been observed".
The drugs were developed to inhibit HIV replication by linking with protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drugs to find a compound that connects to the protease of SARS-CoV-2. There are criticisms in the scientific community about directing resources to repropose drugs specifically developed for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity trial.
Redesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola Virus Disease and Marburg Virus Infections. Gilead Sciences found out after the redesivir had in vitro antiviral activity against wire, pneum, paramix, and coronavirus.
One of the problems with antiviral treatment is resistance developed by mutations, which may cause more serious transmissions or diseases.
Some initial pre-test studies suggest that redesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. There are several ongoing clinical trials, including two conducted by University Hospitals in Cleveland, one for people with moderate disease and one for those with more serious disease.
There are three clinical trials with intravenous vitamin C occurring for people hospitalized and seriously ill with COVID-19: two of them are controlled by placebo (in China and Canada), while the other has no control group (Italy).
The state of New York began testing azithromycin, an antibiotic, on March 24, 2020.
The National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) of Japan plans a clinical test of Alvesco (cyclesonide) of Teijin, which is an inhalable corticosteroid for asthma. The goal is to treat pre-symptom patients infected with the new coronary artery.
Phase II of a study with a type of angiotensin 2 converting enzyme is ongoing with 200 patients, to be recruited among severe cases hospitalized in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the efficacy of treatment.
At the moment, researchers at the Institute of Heart, Canada, are investigating the function of colchicin in reducing pulmonary complications and inflammation in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called COLCORONA, is recruiting 6,000 adults over 40 years of age, diagnosed with COVID-19 and with mild symptoms, who did not need to be hospitalized.
Pregnant women who are breast-feeding or who do not use effective contraceptive methods have not been included in the tests.
Several anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Heparin, low molecular weight, is being widely used in the treatment of patients, which led the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidelines on use.
A multicenter study, with 300 patients, is analyzing the use of enoxaparin sodium in prophylaxis and therapeutic doses. The study was announced on April 14, in Italy.
Because SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, the attention of the scientific community has been considerable in giving new purpose to antiviral drugs approved and developed for the treatment of previous outbreaks, such as those of MERS, SARS and the West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19, according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19, according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Some antibiotics were identified as capable of receiving a new purpose for the treatment of patients with COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6 receiver): approved in China.
There are also tests in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
Vaccine for COVID-19 is a hypothetic vaccine against the 2019 coronary artery disease (COVID-19).
Although there is no vaccine with completed clinical tests, there are several ongoing attempts to develop it.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, a virus causing the disease, available in less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates were in phase I of the safety studies in April.
The COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
There was a large spread of the outbreak in 2020, leading to considerable investments and research activities for the development of a vaccine.
Several organizations are using published genomes for the development of possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
The initiative of the Epidemic Prepared Innovation Coalition, CEPI, stated in April that the needs for vaccine development are speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale development and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported 10 different technology platforms being researched and developing during early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The goals of the largest platforms that have advanced to phase I safety studies include:
nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Modern, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologicals, adenovirus type 5 vector)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the initial stages of development, with 78 confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute). 37 others were announced, but with little information available to the public (considered in planning or being designed).
A phase I-II test performs the preliminary safety and immunogenicity test. It is typically randomised, placebo-controlled and multicenterly at the same time as it determines more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III tests typically involve more participants in a control group. They test the efficacy of the vaccine to avoid the disease while monitoring adverse effects on the ideal dose.
Of the 79 candidates for active developing vaccine (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 had not yet had an assessment in humans (cont'd in preclinical research).
On January 24, 2020, in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it is investigating the potential of a vaccine with a molecular cluster, which would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate an immune reaction.
On 24 January 2020, in Canada, the International Vaccine Center (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan announced the beginning of work in a vaccine, with the aim of testing in humans in 2021.
Vaccines development projects were announced at the China Disease Prevention and Control Centre on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
On January 29, 2020, the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced the start of their work on the development of a vaccine.
Janssen is developing an oral vaccine with her biotech partner in Vaxart.
On 18 March 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a document on the preparation of a vaccine with similar technology as used for vaccination therapy against neoantigens.
On March 25, the head of the research institute announced that they had completed the synthesis of the vaccine and were starting the tests.
On February 27, 2020, a subsidiary company from Generex, NuGenerex Immnuno-Oncology, announced that they were starting a vaccine project to create a li-Key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a vaccine candidate that could be tested in humans "in the next 90 days".
On March 5, 2020, the University of Washington in St. Louis announced its projects to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the U.S. Army Research and Medical Development Command in Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Research Institute in Silver Spring, both in the western Maryland region, announced that they were working on a vaccine.
About 10 March 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it joined Novavax Inc.
in the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
The partners subsequently announced plans for the preclinical test and Phase I of clinical studies in July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that they are working with 11 isolates and, even at an accelerated pace, would take at least one and a half years to develop a vaccine.
On 12 March 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in the city of Quebec, reported the development of a particle similar to Coronavirus under partial funding from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
The vaccine candidate is in research in the laboratory, with the human tests planned for July or August 2020.
Early that week, The Guardian declared that the President of the United States, Donald Trump offered CureVac "great sums of money for exclusive access to the vaccine of Covid-19" under protest from the German government.
On 17 March 2020, the pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to develop a vaccine based on mRNA together.
BNT162, a candidate vaccine based on mRNA, currently in preclinical testing, with clinical tests expected to start in April 2020.
In Italy on 17 March 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company announced that it would have preclinical test results in April 2020 and its candidate for the final vaccine could start for human tests in the autumn.
In France, on 19 March 2020, the Coalition of Innovations in Preparation for Epidemics (CEPI) announced an investment of $4.9 million in a research consortium for vaccine for COVID-19 involving the Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing the total investment of CEPI in the development of vaccine for COVID-19 to 29 million dollars.
The other ECI investment partners for vaccine development for COVID-19 are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, Oxford University, and Queensland University.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health authorities announced that scientists began testing animals of six different vaccine candidates.
Imperial College researchers in London announced on March 20, 2020 that they are developing a self-amplifying RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequencing from China.
At the end of March, the Canadian government announced C$ 275 million in funding for 96 medical countermeasure research projects against COVID-19, including several vaccine candidates at Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and initiatives at the University of Saskatchewan.
Almost in the same period, the Canadian government announced C$ 192 million specifically to develop the vaccine for COVID-19, with plans to establish a national "vaccine bank" of several new vaccines that could be used if other outbreaks of the Coronavirus occur.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported the PittCoVacc test, a possible vaccine against COVID-19 in rats, stating that "MNA delivered S1 subunit vaccines from SARS-CoV-2 that generated potent antibodies specific to antigens [in the mouse] that were evident that started 2 weeks after immunization."
In Canada on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo Pharmacy School announced the development of a DNA-based vaccine candidate as possibly a nasal spray.
Using bacteria, DNA will be planned to replicate within a human bacteria to produce harmless virus-like particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry and three U.S. universities combined resources to access IBM supercomputers, in combination with the cloud computing of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterological effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they may have benefits beyond the disease it prevents.
A later randomized test in Australia is seeking to register 4,170 health workers.
Developing vaccines may not be safe or effective.
Initial studies to evaluate the efficacy of the vaccine using specimens of animals specific to COVID-19, such as the ACE2-transgenic rat, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, indicate a need for containment measures for level 3 biosafety to manipulate live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have already been tested in non-human animals.
In 2020, there is no cure or vaccine that protects against SARS that has proved safe and effective in humans.
According to research documents published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medications to treat SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. There is also no proven vaccine against MERS.
When MERS became predominant, it was believed that the existing SARS research could provide a useful model for the development of vaccines and therapeutic treatment against the infection of MERS-CoV.
As of March 2020, there was a vaccine against MERS (based on DNA) that concluded phase I of clinical studies in humans, and three others in progress, all of which are virus-vectorized vaccines, two with adenoviral vector (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one vectorized by MVA (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media publications promoted a conspiracy theory claiming that the virus behind COVID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
The patents cited by several social media publications indicate existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of Coronavirus such as Coronavirus SARS.
Betacronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a severe acute respiratory syndrome of Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, sore throat, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.
Exposure time up to the onset of symptoms is about 5 days, but may vary from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases result in mild symptoms, some develop into viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases had been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568 thousand people have already been cured. The virus is spread among people mainly during direct contact, usually through goths produced by cough, sneezing or speech.
Although these goths are produced when they expire, they usually fall to the ground or remain on surfaces instead of remaining infectious at long distances.
People can also infect themselves by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching the eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is more contagious during the first 3 days after the onset of symptoms, although dissemination may be possible before symptoms appear and at later stages of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is by chain reaction of reverse transcription polymerase (rRT-PCR) of a nasopharyngeal swab.
The use of masks is recommended for people suspected of the virus and for people responsible for their care.
Recommendations for the use of masks by the population in general vary, where some authorities recommend non-use, some recommend use and others force use.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease was recorded in most countries by all six WHO regions.
Virus infected may be asymptomatic or develop flu-like symptoms, cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, pain or persistent chest pressure, confusion, difficulty staying awake, face or blue lips.
Less common symptoms of upper respiratory tract such as sneezing, sliding nose or throat pain can be seen.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea were observed in different percentages.
Some cases in China initially presented only chest tightness and palpitations.
In some, the disease can evolve into pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death.
This is the so-called incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is normally six days, but may vary from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms will develop them within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that not all infected will develop symptoms.
The function these asymptomatics perform in transmission is not yet fully known; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they can contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected people who do not have symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied, and the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during their stay in the hospital.
The National Health Commission of China began to include asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on 1 April; of the 166 infections that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Sputum and saliva can carry large viral loads.
High speaking frees more goths than normal speaking.
A study in Singapore found that coughing without covering the mouth can cause the drops to reach 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not generally transported by the air, the National Academy of Science suggested that bioaerosol transmission can be possible and air collectors positioned in corridors outside the rooms of people contain positive samples for a viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (PRC), may generate respiratory secretions that will be aerosolized and therefore transmitted by the air.
Although there is concern that it may be transmitted through faeces, if it believes that the risk is low. The virus is more contagious when people are symptomatic. Although it is possible to have transmission before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that although it is not fully clear how easy the disease is spread, usually one or two people infect one or two. The virus survives for hours or days on the surface.
Specifically, it was found that the virus was detectable for one day in cardboard, up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and up to four hours in copper 99%.
This, however, depends on humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergent are also effective if used correctly. Products with soap degrade the protective lipid envelope of the virus, deactivate it, as well as eliminating it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidine glyconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective. In a study conducted in Hong Kong, saliva samples were collected on average two days after the start of hospitalization.
In five of the six patients, the first sample presented the highest viral load, while the sixth patient presented the highest viral load on the second day tested.
The coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new coronavirus of acute respiratory syndrome that was first isolated in three people with pneumonia who were related to a group of acute respiratory diseases in Wuhan.
All characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in nature, in related coronary virus.
Outside the human body, the virus dies in contact with domestic soap, which breaks its layer of protection. SARS-CoV-2 is closely connected to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most affected organs by COVID-19 because the virus accesses host cells through the angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ACE2), which is more abundant in type II alveolar cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called "spicula" (peplomer) to connect to the ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute heart injury was observed in 12% of those infected who were hospitalized at the hospital in Wuhan, China, and is more frequent in the serious disease.
Cardiovascular symptoms are high due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, but acute myocardial injury may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in cardiac function.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was found in ICU patients with COVID-19 infections and may be related to poor prognosis. Necropsies of people who died due to COVID-19 showed diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrates containing lymphocytes in the lung.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has tropism for epithelial cells of the respiratory tract that express ACE2, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, it has been shown that pathogenic T cells secreting GM-CSF have a correlation with the recruitment of secretory inflammatory monocytes of IL-6 and severe lung pathology in patients with COVID-19.
Lymphocytic infiltrates were also reported in necropsy.
WHO published several test protocols for the disease.
The standard test method is the polymerase chain reaction via real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually performed in respiratory samples obtained by means of a nasopharyngeal swab, however, a nasal swab or catarrh sample may be used.
The results are usually available in a few hours up to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but for this it is necessary to collect two blood samples with two weeks of difference and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a strain of coronavirus and publish its genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could develop independently polymerase chain reaction tests (PCR) to detect virus infection.
As of April 4, 2020, tests by means of antibodies (which can detect active infections and if a person has been infected in the past) were being developed, but have not yet been widely used.
The experience of the Chinese with the test showed that their accuracy is 60 to 70%.
The U.S. FDA approved the first remote laboratory test on March 21, 2020, for use at the end of that month. The diagnostic guidelines released by the Zhongnan Hospital at Wuhan University suggest methods to detect infections based on clinical resources and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral multilober dark glass opacitys with peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution are common at the beginning of infection.
Subpleural dominance, mosaic paving (sect lobular thickened with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation may occur as the disease progresses.
There are few data available on microscopic lesions and physiopathology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings during autopsy are:
Macroscopy: pleurisia, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary oedema
Four types of viral pneumonia severity may be observed:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and formation of multinucleated giant cells
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (RASD) and severe hypoxia.
treated pneumonia: organization of exudates in alveolar cavity and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: diffused intravascular coagulation (IDC); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying at home, avoiding places with many people, often washing your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching your eyes, nose and mouth with your hands without washing.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a cloth when coughing or sneezing, as well as covering the mouth with the inner side of the elbow if the cloth is not available.
Appropriate hand hygiene after coughing or sneezing is encouraged.
The CDC recommended the use of cloth masks in public places, in part to limit transmission by asymptomatic individuals. Social distancing strategies aim to reduce contact of people infected with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restrict travel and cancel large public meetings.
Distance guidelines also include people staying at least 1.8 meters (6 feet) away from each other.
An effective medicine for the prevention of COVID-19 is not known. Since the vaccine should not be launched before 2021, a key point for the control of COVID-19 is to try to reduce the peak of the epidemic, also known as "purchase of the curve".
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands frequently using soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or when the hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after wheezing, coughing or sneezing.
It also recommends to use antiseptics for hands the alcohol base with at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not readily available. For locations where antiseptics for commercial hands are not readily available, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, antimicrobial activity is performed by means of ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; it is not "an active substance for asepsis of hands".
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
People are treated through palliative care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support and support for other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that people who suspect that they are with the virus wear a simple facial mask.
The oxygenation of the extracorporeal membrane (OCMO) was used to treat the problem of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under analysis.
Personal hygiene and healthy lifestyle and diet are being recommended to improve immunity.
Support treatments can be useful for those people with mild symptoms and early stages of infection. WHO and the National Health Commission of China published recommendations for the care of people hospitalized with COVID-19.
Intensive and pneumologist physicians from the U.S.A. gathered recommendations for the treatment of several agencies in a free resource, the IBCC.
Until April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some health professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen for first-line use.
It is necessary to take precautions to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in the health environment, when procedures are being performed that can generate aerosols, such as intubation and manual ventilation.
For health professionals caring for people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in rooms with isolation of airborne infections (SIIA) as well as taking standard precautions, contact precautions and air precautions. The CDC summarizes the guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is: EPI blanket, breather or face mask, visual protection and medical gloves. When available, it is preferable to use respirators instead of facial masks.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial environments, but the FDA has authorised masks for use under Emergency Use Authorisation (USA).
They were designed to protect against air particles as dust, but their effectiveness against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed for undescribed uses.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of facial shields or, as a last resort, home masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not serious enough to require mechanical ventilation or alternatives, but a percentage of cases are.
The type of respiratory support for individuals with respiratory failure related to COVID-19 is being studied for people in hospitals, with some evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high flow nasal cannula or positive pressure in the airways on two levels.
If either of these two benefits the same for people who are seriously ill, it is not known.
Some doctors prefer to have invasive mechanical ventilation when it is available because this technique limits the aerosol particles to spread, compared to the high flow nasal cannula. Serious cases are more common in elderly people (those over 60 years and especially over 80 years).
Many developing countries do not have adequate per capita hospital beds, which limits the capacity of the health system to deal with sudden escalation in the number of severe cases of COVID-19 to require hospitalization.
A study in China observed that 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people in the hospital with COVID-19 were eventually taken to the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex as acute respiratory distress syndrome (RASD) develops in VOCID-19 and oxygenation becomes increasingly difficult.
Ventilators with pressure control mode and high level PEEP are necessary to increase oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of lung lesions and pneumothorax associated with ventilation.
High level PEEP may not be available in older fans.
The research for potential treatments began in January 2020 and clinical tests are being carried out with various antiviral drugs.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new medicines may take up to 2021 to be developed, several of the drugs tested have already been approved for other uses or are in advanced testing phase.
Antiviral medicine can be tested in people with various diseases.
WHO recommended that volunteers participate in the efficacy and safety tests of potential treatments. The FDA gave temporary permission for the use of plasma of convalescent people as treatment in cases where the life of the person is serious and immediately threatened.
The clinical studies needed to show their safety and effectiveness against the disease have not yet been performed.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the outbreak of the disease.
It is requested that users report their name and ID number.
The application can detect the "near contact" using monitoring data and thus the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the application not only recommends quarantine as well as alerts local health authorities. Big data analysis of cellular data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are being used to track infected people and the people with whom they had contact in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government authorized security agencies to track mobile phone data from people who are allegedly with coronavirus.
The measure was taken to strengthen quarantine and protect people who can come in contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregate telephone location data with the German federal government agency, Robert Koch Institute, to research and prevent virus transmission.
Russia has implemented facial recognition technology to detect those who disregard quarantine.
The Italian regional health commissioner Giulio Gallera said he was informed by mobile operators that "40% of people continue to circulate anyway".
The German government conducted a 48-hour weekend hackaton with more than 42,000 participants.
In addition, Estonia's president, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a global appeal for creative solutions against the spread of the coronavirus.
Individuals may experience difficulties in quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of infection in themselves.
BBC quoted Rory O'Connor, who said: "The increase in social isolation, loneliness, medical anxiety, stress and an economic crisis are a perfect storm to harm people's mental health and well-being."
The disease may have a mild evolution, with few or no symptoms, resembling other common diseases of the upper respiratory tract, such as cold.
Mild cases usually recover within two weeks, while those with severe or critical disease may take from three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may have a higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection, according to data from other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but lack data from COVID-19. In some people, COVID-19 may affect the lungs, causing pneumonia.
In those most severely affected, COVID-19 can rapidly progress to adult respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), causing respiratory failure, septic shock or multiple organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, coagulation disorders and heart, kidney and liver damage.
Coagulation disorders, specifically the increase in prothrombin time, were described in 6% of hospitalizations in hospitals with COVID-19, while renal failure was seen in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20-30% of people with COVID-19 have high liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the median between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five hospitalizations.
However, patients transferred to an ICU had a median of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In a study with early cases, the median manifestation of initial symptoms to death was 14 days, with a total interval of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, men had a mortality rate of 2.8%, while women had a mortality rate of 1.7%.
Histopathological examinations of post-mortem lung samples show diffuse alveolar damage with exudated cellular fibromyxoid in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were observed in pneumocytes.
The imaging examination of the lung looked like acute respiratory discomfort syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, heart damage was detected due to high levels of troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to data from the United States of America, 89% of the hospitalized had pre-existing comorbidities. The availability of medical resources and socioeconomic factors in a region can also affect mortality.
Estimates of comorbidity mortality vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
Subnotification of light cases may cause the mortality rate to be overestimated.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of past cases may mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to have severe COVID-19 symptoms and approximately 2.4 times more likely to require intensive treatment or die, compared with non-smokers. Concerns were raised regarding long-term sequelae of the disease.
Hong Kong's hospital authority found a 20% to 30% drop in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and lung examinations indicated organ damage.
This can also lead to intensive post-care syndrome after recovery.
Until March 2020, it was not known whether past infections would give effective and lasting immunity to people who recovered from the disease.
Immunity is seen as probable based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but cases were reported in which the recovery of COVID-19 was followed by positive tests for coronavirus at a later date.
These cases are believed to be the worsening of a prolonged infection rather than a reinfection.
It is believed that the virus is natural and has animal origin through transhipment infection.
The actual origin is unknown, but as of December 2019, the spread of the infection has become almost entirely driven by the transmission of humans to humans.
A study with the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed that the oldest date of the onset of symptoms was 1 December 2019.
Official WHO publications reported the oldest date of the onset of symptoms as December 8, 2019.
Several measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary by region and time and are influenced by the volume of tests, quality of the health system, treatment options, time elapsed since the initial outbreak and population characteristics such as age, sex and health in general.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned emergency ICD-10 disease codes U07.1 to deaths resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed in the laboratory and U07.2 to deaths due to COVID-19 with clinical or epidemiological diagnosis, without SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed in the laboratory. The mortality rate reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a given time interval.
Based on the statistics of Johns Hopkins University, the overall lethality rate was 6.9% (153.822/2240.191) on 17 April 2020.
The number varies by region. Other measures include the mortality rate per case (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed individuals who die from a disease, and the mortality rate by infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) individuals who die from a disease.
These statistics are not restricted to time and accompany a specific population from infection to case resolution.
Although not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies can give information about how many people have been infected.
In the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600, 80 (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease was spread by carnival festivals and spread among younger people, causing a relatively lower mortality, and not all deaths by COVID-19 should have been formally recorded as such.
In addition, the German health system was not overloaded.
In the Netherlands, about 3% may have antibodies, as verified in blood donors.
69 (0.004% of the population) died by confirmed COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality rate are different for men and women.
Mortality is higher in men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The greatest risk for men is in the 50 years range, with the difference between men and women approaching only 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact reasons for the difference between the sexes are not known, but genetic and behavioral factors may be the reason.
Immunological differences due to sex, lower prevalence of women smokers and the development by men of comorbidities as hypertension at a younger age than women may have contributed to higher mortality among men.
In Europe, 57% of infected individuals were men, and 72% of those killed by COVID-19 were men.
Until April 2020, the US government was not tracking data on COVID-19 infections related to sex.
Studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women of different ways.
A higher percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and they are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease was "COVID-19".
WHO chief Tedros Adhanon Ghebreysus explained that "CO" is "corona", "VI", "virus", "D", disease and "19" is from when the outbreak was identified: December 31, 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographic location (e.g., China), animal species or group of people, in accordance with the international recommendations of nomenclature to prevent stigmatization. The virus causing COVID-19 was called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 virus" in communications to the public.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly referred to as "coronavirus".
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly called "coronavirus" and "wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended "2019-nCov" and "acute respiratory disease for 2019-nCoV" as temporary names for the virus and disease, according to the 2015 orientation against the use of sites in names of diseases and viruses.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing health material, such as nasopharyngeal zaragots and parts of respirators.
In one example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed a respirator valve, and the supplier was unable to deliver on the necessary schedule, a local startup did reverse engineering and printed the 100 necessary valves from one day to the next.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and misinformation arose about the origin, dimension, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease, which quickly spread over the Internet.
Apparently, humans are able to transmit the virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No medicine or vaccine has been approved for the treatment of the disease.
International research on vaccines and medicines for COVID-19 is underway in government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization began the "SOLIDARITY Trial" to evaluate the effects of treatment with four existing antiviral components with more likely effectiveness.
There is no vaccine available, but several agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous works on SARS-CoV are being used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
There are three vaccination strategies being investigated.
First, researchers aim to develop a vaccine with the integral virus.
The use of this virus, whether inactive or dead, aims to provoke a rapid immune response from the human body to a new COVID-19 infection.
A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain virus subunits.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research concentrates on the spicula protein that helps the virus enter the receptor of the enzyme ACE2.
A third strategy is that of vaccines of nucleic acid ( DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique to create vaccines).
Experimental vaccines of any of these strategies should have the safety and efficacy tested. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical test of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a copy of the virus's harmless genetic code that causes the disease. Antibody-dependent improvement was pointed out as a possible challenge for the development of a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, but this is controversial.
More than 300 clinical tests have been underway since April 2020.
Seven tests evaluated treatments already approved for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The redirection of antiviral drugs consists of most Chinese research, with nine clinical tests at phase III of redesivir in several countries due to a report at the end of April.
A dynamic analysis of the clinical development of candidates for medicine and vaccine for COVID-19 was ongoing in April 2020. Several existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated for treatment of COVID-19, including redesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir combined with interferon beta.
There is an attempt to prove the effectiveness of redesivir since March 2020.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with redesivir for compassionate use.
Phase III clinical tests are being performed in the USA, China and Italy. Chloroquina, already used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, there are requests for peer review of the research.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Virology Institute, although recommending a daily dose of one gram, warns that twice that dose is highly dangerous and can be lethal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA published an emergency authorisation for the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of doctors treating people with COVID-19. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir for use against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended to be more studied in vivo after demonstrating low inhibitory concentration of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that the initial spicle protein in preparation for the transmembranary protease of serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Studies on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have great limitations that have prevented the medical community from adopting these therapies without further studies. oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
The cytokine storm may be a complication in the later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-tempestad properties of cytokine. Tocilzumab was included in the treatment guidelines by the National Health Commission of China after a small study was completed.
A non-randomised test is under way at national level phase 2 in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe disease.
Combined with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokine storms, it is expected that neutralize these developments, which are considered the cause of the death of some affected people.
The interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA based on retrospective case studies on the treatment of the syndrome of release of refractory cytokines to steroids induced by a different cause, CAR T cell therapy in 2017.
So far, there is no controlled and randomized evidence that tocilzumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immunological system of those who recovered from the COVID-19 to people who need them is being investigated as a non-vaccinal method of passive immunization.
This strategy was tested for SARS, with inconclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mechanism of action whereby passive antibody therapy can mediate a defense against SARS-CoV-2.
Other mechanisms, however, such as cell cytotoxicity dependent on antibodies and/or phagocytosis, may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example, use monoclonal antibodies manufactured, are being developed.
The production of convalescent serum, which consists of the liquid portion of the blood of recovered patients and contains specific antibodies to this virus, could be increased for faster implementation.
Coronavirus disease, a group of highly related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, who later contracted and died of COVID-19 after raising awareness about the spread of the virus.
