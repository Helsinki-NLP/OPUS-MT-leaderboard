What do you count? The ČSSD in Prague doesn't know either Voldemort or pastry
The new ČSSD councils in the capital will have to overcome, as it seems, the clear language barriers for the members of the Prague Board and the municipal council to understand their renewed ODS partners.
The Aktuálně.cz period "examined" the members of the new Council of ČSSD to check their knowledge of the slang marked language that has emerged in recent years in the Council, when the current members of the coalition were ruling Prague.
The encoded dictionary that used Prague's flower and political cream during the previous period, by Mayor Pavel Bém, includes some of the most well-known characters, situations and causes of the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it has been found that the new councillors hardly understand these well-known concepts.
At least that's what they say.
"Who's Voldemort?"
"The truth is I don't know."
"I am rather an innovate in Prague politics," said during the termology examination of "colegory" the councillor of culture Lukáš Kaucký.
As for the political veteran, Karel Březina also reacted.
Maybe they know the concept of golf today.
"Perhaps it's the only expression of all you've asked me that I use from time to time."
"If not, usually not slang work."
From the glossary, whose definitions published the newspaper Aktualně.cz last June before the ODS polling conference, the editorial selected six examples, particularly those that are especially related to the municipal authorities of Prague.
The socialists had to explain the concepts "Voldemort", "greater golf hole in Prague", "go to the pastry", "nuca de toro", "treason of the capital" and "blindar".
Three councillors agreed to submit to the test and a quarter, Antonín Weinert, who in the future will be responsible for education in Prague, initially agreed, but did not pick up the phone again.
The fifth councilman, Petr Dolínek, refused to do so directly.
"I don't get involved in these things, nor do I think I appreciate how democratic civics have fun."
"What I do care about is how we will understand ourselves in the execution of our programs," he said.
As has been seen, Councilman Lukáš Kaucký allegedly did not realize that the previous title is an expression on an influential entrepreneur and a friend of former mayor Bém, Roman Janoušek.
To Kaucký the word "Voldemort" tells him nothing; the only term he rightly said in the exam is "the largest golf hole in Prague".
"It's about the Blanka tunnel," says Kaucký, who immediately adds: "but rather I know about the news."
"I'm going to have to aim for a language course," he jokes.
Karel Březina is not the only one who recognizes in the golf course the Blanka tunnel, but also the councillor of Environment Lukáš Imagingý.
Afterwards, both socio-democrats know who is really Voldemort and Lukaš Imagingý even knows where to find that character; moreover, they suspect the meaning of "go to the pastry".
"I think it means going to a company in Prague"; it soon reveals to Picture that it is the headquarters of the companies in Janoušek.
Like Březina, it indicates that such knowledge gained them from the news, but that it does not use such vocabulary.
According to the participants in the test, there is no such familiar glossary of colloquial terms among the socio-democrats.
"I asked my colleagues, but it really looks like we don't have anything like that."
"But we use nicknames between us, sometimes abbreviations or play word games with names," says ČSSD president Pragense, Petr Hulinský, whose party partners call Hulda.
"In school they called me Bříza, but I don't know if my colleagues also call me that," confesses their own nickname Karel Březina.
The newspaper Aktuálně.cz tested the name and worked.
For his party partners, Weinert is Děda (like "yayo") or, less friendly, Dědek ("old"), the representative Miroslav Poche, with whom they associated before the cheating elections during the party's sponsorship, receives the nickname "Igráček" ("playmobil") from some of his colleagues.
The nicknames are also the only expressions that socio-democrats tolerate in the speech within the party.
Hulínský does not like calling him Hulda, but Aktualně.cz discovered even other nicknames for this president to preach.
"The doctor of the rights of fuckers" seems to remember that Petr Hulinský obtained his PhD in law at the police academy in Bratislava.
The Government wants to limit the torture of the witches, as published in a booklet
Women considered witches in Burkina Faso share certain characteristics.
They are usually elderly, cannot work, for example, for health reasons, are single and have no children.
The women who "turn around" witches are sent to an isolated area, so that they do not harm the rest of the people.
"Men rarely suffer such a thing."
"It also does not isolate healthy young women, because they help in the work and have children," explains a nun who, in the capital of West Africa Burkina Faso, occupies a special residence of over a hundred women expelled from their communities.
The local government has decided to oppose this unusual "social measure".
It issued an information leaflet that should help to avoid witch hunting.
However, this has a stick.
"More than 70% of adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," warns Die Standard on the disadvantages of written awareness.
Witchcraft accusations are also common in other African countries.
In Ghana, a neighbouring country in Burkina Faso, 72-year-old Ammy Hemma died last week, when three women and two men tortured her, covered her with gasoline and burned her.
The news appeared in the BBC.
The authors claim that it was due to a wretched accumulation of circumstances.
According to her version, the woman was caught in the oil used for ritual anointing.
He was set on fire when the group wanted to "excite the evil spirits" from the woman.
The isolation of the witches supports it by people of all educational levels.
The newspaper Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur in Burkina Faso: "The devourers of human souls have always posed a danger," he said.
While in Burkina Faso the Government tried to appease witch hunting, last year in Gambia the president was still involved.
"The Gambian President Jammeh, after his aunt's death, launched a large hunt for witches who allegedly had been related to his death and had attempted to kill the president himself through black magic."
"To help, he brought shamans from nearby Guinea who, protected by police, military and the president's personal escort, forced men and women randomly chosen from among the Gambian peoples to the property of the president in Kavalua," says Amnesty International in his report.
At the farm, the arrested people had to drink a handful of herbs with hallucinogenic effects that also caused them intestinal and renal problems.
Two of the arrested did not survive the stay on the farm.
After international pressure, about a thousand people were finally released.
The Bakala tenant: is heated with coal stoves and signs a higher rent
The old and recio man crossed the doors of the customer service center of the RPG Byty company of the "coal magnet" Zdeňek Bakala, the largest private owner of apartments for rent in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm he carried documents with the new three-storey rental contracts: his, his daughter's and his son's, which is serving sentence.
All three have just caught the liberalisation of rents.
Instead of 3,500 Czech crowns a month, the child will pay from next year 4,100 crowns for a two-room apartment with separate second-class kitchen.
"In addition, there is no hot water and heating is based on a solid fuel boiler," he says with his finger in his son's new contract, on whose signature he has full powers.
"But I signed it," explains half angry, half resigned.
The civil association BytyOKD.cz, which called the new rental conditions "uncorrect and indecent", recommends to tenants not to sign the new contracts and to wait until December 7, when he will publish a guide informing on how to proceed in these cases.
But, in this case, man only makes one suitor.
"Each one says something," he says with a bad face.
Ostrava is becoming a large laboratory for testing liberalization.
After New Year it will happen with the vast majority of the floors that, in the Czech Republic, were so far under a regulated rental.
Therefore, Aktuálně.cz decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
The RPG mining waiting room is one of Ostrava's four and on Tuesday at nine o'clock, it was already full.
Right next to the doors are the security guards and next to them a number pickup machine.
"To rent 2011", you can read on a light button on your touch screen.
When you press it, you get out of the machine a little paper with a number.
It hardly gives time or read "157" and the number already appears on the large screen located at the top of the room.
In a second, you're in line.
Shortly thereafter, an elderly marriage comes to ask, but the crowd of the room is not here for the new rentals.
Most people come to solve common problems, such as in the past: settlement requests, insurance issues and similar issues.
The letters with the new rental contracts will arrive in Ostrava to the lodges of the tenants of most of the 44,000 floors belonging to RPG around mid-November.
RPG Byty proposes in the letters an increase in rent between 15 and 38%.
On November 18, a special window is opened at the customer service centre for new rentals.
"It's been working for a week, so it's starting," they answer, after they have doubted briefly, the workers who are in it when the customer presents himself as a journalist.
Liberalization and the old floors for Bakala miners are the most delicate themes in the area.
Before the elections, the Vice-President of Parliament, originally from Ostrava, Lubomír Zaoralek, from ČSSD, had already treated them high and clear, and now they appear continuously in the newspapers in the area.
"Twenty years later I want a new floor."
"They didn't even change my damn bathroom plate," the man mentioned in the introduction was drowned.
According to the workers, for the moment they are more than nothing retired to check whether they receive a discount on rent if they sign in time, as the special RPG offer promises.
They will also receive half of the discount on the rent of February the remaining tenants signing the new contract by 15 December.
However, the window of mining "liberalization" certainly fails to dispel the flood of doubts.
"Of the 360 customers who were here yesterday, they only asked about the rental in 2011 about forty-fifty people," said the employee of the window.
Meanwhile, RPG proposes on the web and on its tables to hold individual meetings on contracts when necessary.
If both parties do not reach agreement on the rental, an independent judge will have to resolve the issue.
"It's not a threat, it's information about the only way of proceeding possible and completely in accordance with the law," RPG warns on its pages.
"There is no one to be judged here," says one of RPG Byty's employees and a man who is on the street in front of the customer service center gives him, at least in part, the reason.
"I receive a pension of 13,000 and I have 5,000 left for food; I have no means to go to the courts," he says.
But immediately, the employee sows doubt.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaoralek warns them in the media that they don't sign, so maybe people wait," he says.
The rental regulation will cease to exist in most of the Czech Republic in early 2011 and according to RPG Byty, its increase is an economic necessity.
"Current rents still do not cover even the amounts necessary for the maintenance of the community fund," recalls Pavel Klimeš, director of the residential portfolio of the company RPG Byty, who adds that the careless state of the community fund that upsets the tenants is, for the owners, the main reason for increasing the rent.
While during the five years between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able to invest in apartments four billion, in the four years from 2011 to 2014 the figure will increase to 5.2 billion.
The large screen that hangs from the roof, in front of the seats of the waiting room, now repeats some data that highlight in red.
"The increase in rent in 2011 by 15% and less applies to 31,200 apartments, i.e. more than 90% of RPG properties."
"In addition, it will always be at most 7.50 Czech krona monthly per square metre," it is indicated on the screen.
Only increases by 38% the rent of 400 floors of the RPG portfolio.
"In such cases, it is an increase from extremely low amounts, of 19.66 crowns per square metre," says RPG.
On 2,600 floors, the rent will remain invariable next year.
RPG Byty promises that liberalisation will not impact rents at any rate, but will rise from four to eight years.
In addition, it adds the following commitment: the company will invest all the money from the rise of the rent (see the chart) again on the floors, mainly in heating savings: new windows and heating.
Priority will be given to persons signing the rental upgrade agreement.
Architects have understood that offices also need day care
The Avriopoint administrative building in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design.
No one would say that he also hides inside a small nursery with everything he owns at such facilities: walls of colors, creative furniture and even a miniature park on the outside terrace.
Since October last year, the children of the employees of Arch.Design can come to her.
The architectural project company Arch.Design, whose study came from numerous well-known buildings in Brno, thought from the first sketches of the Avriopoint building to include a space for its mini-guard.
About 90 people work in the company, mainly in the age of the baby boom and wanted to allow architects and designers to return to work soon after maternity.
Along with the possibility of enjoying a reduced schedule, day care is one of the benefits that Arch.Design your workers in the framework of your social program.
Constructors and architects in this way have the possibility to combine a demanding profession with the care of children.
The miniguard was an idea of Arch.Designu's employees themselves and, with the support of management, managed to obtain funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company's mini-guardia is financed through the European Social Fund under the operational programme for human resources and employment, as well as the Czech State budget.
Thanks to the funding provided (an allocation of more than 2.8 million Czech crowns) they were able to purchase the equipment and, after two years, to hire qualified personnel and services.
When the funding is exhausted (two years), Arch.Design has an obligation to maintain the mini-guard with its own funds for three years.
The preparation of the project lasted for one year and in the submission of the application for funding contributed the Economy Rating company.
The care of children is in the hands of qualified staff; moreover, a nurse and teacher of the Ministry of Education are present all day, although most of them are less than three years old.
Since it is a "mini-guardy", it can only accommodate a maximum of five children simultaneously, although with shifts more come during the day.
The functioning of the day-care centre is flexible to adapt to the needs of the parents and children of all workers have the same right to use the day-care centre, regardless of the hierarchy within the company.
Although it is an individual education and care, the contents of the mini-guardian programme are comparable to the usual pre-school education programme.
In it children not only play, but also receive quality teaching: from basic learning to preparation for school, they teach to English.
The class not only has toys and table games, but also has a computer for children.
The presence of young children in the company itself creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can go to their children at any time and avoid the stress of collecting late school children when they are away from their place of work.
Thus, parents are more productive while working.
It is not surprising that this naturally generates a relationship of loyalty between the worker and his employer.
In this way, Arch.Design is among the sign companies that offer a great advantage for the admission of new workers: they support the family and, ultimately, this program reinforced the marketing of staff.
The bone house continues to fascinate after 100 years. Watch the interiors of Gaudí
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs remind the column of a dinosaur and the balconies look like the mouth of an open fish.
This is the Batlló House, in Barcelona, by Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
Because of its shape similar to a skeleton, the locals nicknamed it "the bone house".
Its organic forms, its striking colors, the innovative use of the stone, the fragments of tiles and mosaics, a facade reminiscent of the scales and the omnipresent gently curved lines, all of this is typical of Antoni Gaudí's secession.
The cover of the house plays with dream lines, delicate colors and textures taken from nature and fauna.
By paying more attention, a certain geometry, rhythm and carefully thought order is observed.
At night, the whole facade of the house seems even more impressive, as it is illuminated so that the brightness of the colors is improved.
Serpentea and the twisting of the shapes continues to surprise us also within it.
The corrugated wood copies the frames of the windows, the rails, the ornaments of the doors, the mirrors and the signposts.
The Casa Batlló, which is located in Eixample district in the number 43 of the lively commercial street of Passeig de Gràcia, emerged from the refurbishment of a house in 1877 by architect Emilio Sala Cortés.
The reconstruction lasted two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrial Josep Batlló, initially insisted on overthrowing the previous building and starting from scratch, but soon accepted Gaudí's idea of a new and cheaper reconstruction.
However, the Batlló House, consisting of several apartments, did not design it Antoni Gaudí alone.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol collaborated in the design.
In fact, in their project plans, ornaments emerged for the representative apartment of the owner of the property and the mosaics used on the facade.
In the facade also workers other creators and artists.
The collaboration in the proposals of Casa Batlló was the beginning of Jujol's successful collaboration with Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of Casa Milá and the Güell Park in Gaudí, where other pieces of it are found.
Because of its organic form, the premises shortly after its completion nicknamed it "the bone house".
Others, due to the specific mechanism of opening the windows began to call it "the house of bosteches".
It is also said that, at the top of the construction, appears the sword of St. George, patron of Catalonia.
Other sculptural elements of construction hide religious motives.
Gaudí projected in the house a unique system for the central heating season with ventilation vents and typical fireplaces.
It may be strange its forty-five degree inclination.
During the construction, Gaudí did not respect the construction rules of the moment at all and was not influenced by them.
Even so, the construction obtained the corresponding permit from the outset, although obviously in it the data indicated on the planned reconstruction were so vague that, two years later, upon its completion, the town council was so impacted with the result it requested to be corrected.
He was upset, for example, that the construction included columns even to the public pavement.
The arrangements were never made, rather, on the contrary: just fifteen days after the city's application, Josep Batlló requested (and obtained) permission to rent the two highest floors of the building.
The owner himself was installed on the lower floors.
In the gallery of the second floor was the living room and on the third floor the bedrooms and the private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented at a jewelry store.
The house, on six floors, is completely crossed by a staircase leading to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of the reform consisted of breaking all angles and straight lines, covering them with curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of space connection.
The common part can be connected completely by opening the doors of the salons and a larger group can communicate in this manner without problems, without giving up the necessary privacy for more intimate conversations.
The house, with Gaudí's reconstruction, not only got a new facade, but also an unusual roof and two additional floors.
It is also impressive how Gaudí plays with the light, white and blue tiles covering the inner courtyard and skylights.
The game with the two colors provides maximum light on all floors of the house.
It was based simply on the principle that the white reflects more light than the dark colors, which instead absorb the rays of the sun.
Anyone can visit the Batlló House, which was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2005.
On the first floor of the house you will find the most spacious and refilled apartment accessible to the public.
The owners decided to open the doors to the public in 2002 on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
With the visits they confirmed, or discovered, that it is a very beneficial business and extended visits to the common area and to the buhardilla, including the roof terrace.
The price of the entrance to the monument is not insignificant, it reaches 16.50 euros, although students, retirees and holders of tourist cards get 20% discount.
The amount considerably exceeds the price of the entry of other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to enjoy the true atmosphere of the bed with your lizard towers, you should quickly become friends with some resident of the neighboring houses and visit you at home.
How the mattress and the somier are chosen: women and men are looking for different things
Nothing of a pompous frame for the bed; what really confers its quality on a good bed is the surface to lie down, i.e. the mattress and the somier.
First of all, they must be complemented by perfection in order to adapt to specific users.
Many elements, including weight, height, health status and owner's sex, come into play during the election.
Also important is the type of interior in which the mattress and the somier are placed.
A typical example?
For example, in a weekend cottage that usually does not have heating, latex mattresses should not be used because they "heat" more slowly.
In addition, they usually weigh considerably more than the usual polyurethane mattresses.
It is therefore necessary to turn them around more frequently.
If the central channels are not properly aired and above, they are on a firm basis, they keep inside the moisture. Even the mold below may appear.
When choosing a bed, customs also influence.
Those who have spent a lot of time abroad often use a very high mattress with a soft layer and will have problems feeling good on a lower and tougher surface.
"Almost all hockey players returning from the NHL complained that they didn't sleep here as well."
"For their bruised shoulders, heels and hips they needed mattresses with a soft layer of viscoelastic."
"This type of mattresses are also recommended for people with diabetes who have problems with the nervous system, so they get bad information about the joints and the skin," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in the covered furniture.
Many hockey players, like other customers, take time preferring viscoelastic mattresses.
"Today there is no problem, because they have these suitable Tempur and Italian Magniflex, but also the Czech Tropic brand."
You don't have to be a NHL player anymore in order to appreciate viscoelastics.
This "miracle" works in a very simple way.
Optimizes your rigidity and shape depending on the heat absorbed or adapts to your body heat.
Nothing exerts pressure; during the night, it will not turn like after a hard match.
Just sleep better.
Viscoelastics also works as a protection against the wrinkles.
When choosing the size of the mattress, add the length of its feet, i.e. between 21 and 34 cm.
A man or woman with a height of about 180 cm will need a bed between 210 and 220 cm.
The minimum width for a person should be, in a double room, 90 cm, in total 180 cm.
For individual rooms, for example singles, it is recommended at least between 120 and 140 cm.
So that a possible visit is also comfortable.
"If not, you can apply a simple rule to calculate the width: when you fall face up, you should have your hands comfortably shrinked towards the elbows," advises engineer Helena Prokopová, expert from Cechu čalouníkänk to dekorater, who has been busy for many years with the problems of healthy sleep and ergonomics of furniture, which teaches in specialized schools.
In the double rooms, everyone needs their own somier and mattress, so during the purchase you need to pay attention to combine the height of the mattresses.
Otherwise, it will be necessary to mount the somies at different heights, which is not always possible in all beds.
Foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, models with inner springs a minimum of 15 cm, of which at least three cm are for the layer that adapts to the shapes and smoothness.
"By touching it with your hand or staying on the mattress, no doubt the docks should not be noticed," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a particular type of somier.
The fully covered bedrooms, on which the mattress and base are like siames, make no sense in the bedroom.
The mattresses breathe badly and you can't wash your back, which is often done today.
And since every night we sweat between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sweat, it is clear that after about five or seven years the mattress will begin to remind us of a large (and congested) slum.
For this reason, experts reject slogans that speak of a mattress life of up to 25 years or even a life assurance.
However, everything has one but.
Therefore, sellers give advice: on mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm, take care of the cleaning and washing of the floor, but better add a mattress protector that can be removed and washed easily.
Although mattress covers are currently manufactured with zip closure throughout its perimeter, so by opening them they are left in two parts (something very important for washing and washing machine size!), their handling in the larger models (and for one person) when lifting the mattress may seem like a fight between a fly weight and a heavy weight.
In bed, instead of a somier, do you have a firm table?
Never!
As much for the beds thought to spend one night the visits.
However, you must make (if you do not already have them) ventilation holes on the table and should be used with a mattress with springs inside and a minimum height of 15 cm with the springs in bags (such as the German Taschenfederkern) and a soft layer.
Polyurethane mattresses should not be used on such bases.
For somies of non-jointable sheets containing between 14 and 18 sheets, mattresses of latex or sandwich mattresses (e.g. a combination of latex and coconut fiber) may be used, although it is always better to use a somier with a greater number of sheets, 28 or more, in which the plates of the lumbar area are reinforced and their rigidity can be regulated.
Articular sheet somies should not be used with a spring mattress, since they do not react to reclination.
In addition to the adjustment of the rigidity of the blades, the protection of shoulders can also be used.
It is a special fixation of the blades that allows to press or even tilt the blades in such a way that they "round" perfectly to the shoulders during the sleep.
For men with very wide shoulders, it is something very important.
They even remember the mattress manufacturers who, in the "male", began to use a softer area right around the shoulders.
They also remember women, for whom they put a softer area around their hips.
For the most demanding customers, there are somies with cross structure or tables with so-called multitorsion damping.
Pressure is distributed between different points and tension is lowered.
It should also be taken into account that, although it uses the appropriate mattress and somier, if it uses a bad pillow (large and "waisted"), most of the advantages will disappear.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow should hold the head and the corners can only reach the shoulders, so they can relax their muscles.
The recommended suitable size is 50 x 60 cm, something normal for example in Scandinavia.
When lying aside, the pillow should be on the same level (when combined with the somier with shoulder reinforcement or the softest area of the mattress) as the shoulder height.
Modern mattresses have something to do, as it seems, with original mattresses filled with straw.
Manufacturers continue to use, more and more often, natural materials or at least mixtures.
In fact, the biological mattresses are fashionable.
Oil-based raw materials, with which polyurethane foam is manufactured, are filled with natural oils, such as rice or soybeans.
In fact, virtually all known manufacturers use soybeans.
"Biological, in the case of mattresses, means that the centre is manufactured only from materials of natural origin," explains Petr Vašíček of the company Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used during the manufacture of the mattress bottom, one of the first true aloe.
But you can also choose the microcapsules, which release a fresh aroma to the forest or lavender.
There are also differences for men and women.
While men "refresh" themselves with vegetal extracts of breeze, so that the mattress bottom absorbs heat and cools the body, women prefer to "heat" the floor.
Red pepper extract improves blood circulation, so women feel more warm.
The current favorites?
The mattresses made of cold foam, which are more porous, with a structure of adapted cells, making them more permeable than those of normal polyurethane and offer more permeability.
The combination of various cold and viscoelastic foam stiffnesses allows the manufacture of mattresses from various areas that know perfectly where the head, shoulders and heels go.
A good quality mattress will cost you seven thousand crowns upwards.
Those who perform a therapeutic function usually have lower VAT, as they are considered to be means of health.
The first to gain this advantage in the Czech Republic was Gumotex.
It is difficult to save on mattresses and somies.
Sometimes the offers of manufacturers or sellers can be approved, which sometimes offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers Duofreez mattresses with a foam with memory attached to the back for 11,990 crowns.
The second is obtained free of charge.
The era of viscoelastics with an open cell structure and a large density began with Tempur's "cosmic" material.
Initially it emerged as material for NASA, because during the takeoffs the astronauts were subjected to a huge overload.
Tempur softens with heat and hardens with cold.
Therefore, the human body, warm, exerts a perfect effect and optimally adapts its pressure.
Therefore, it is ideal to prevent sores from occurring, but also to improve comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foam is used not only on mattresses, but also for sanitary products, for example for pillows that are placed under the legs and relieve them, as well as their circulation.
National manufacturers, for example, use Eucatherm C or Twinsaver foam and similar.
More and more parents use tracking devices to control their children
Fear of children leads more and more people to think about controlling them by GPS.
The system, initially designed for the tracking of vehicles, can also follow the movement of people and thus contribute, for example, in case of the disappearance of the nine-year-old girl Anička Janatková.
For the moment the device has the approximate size of a pair of glasses, but will soon be reduced to the size of a watch.
Many people feared the case of missing Anička and began to inform themselves about the means available to better protect their children.
Even at the cost of invading your privacy.
"We all try to tell us that it is not a matter of spying, but of another means of reducing the possibility of a tragedy," says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of tracking devices in the Czech market.
"I recognise that in certain cases such devices can be abused, for example if they get into someone's pocket without their knowledge, but we have not yet met such cases."
"Most customers actually buy it for security reasons," Pilin adds.
In their opinion, children should always know what the "box" is for and how it is used in the event of an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bočková warns that if the child does not want to take him, he will just throw him away.
"Even younger children show great creativity when intentionally losing certain things if they want to avoid being controlled."
"In the past, parents relied heavily on mobile phones, but these could be turned off as easily as the tracking device," Bočková says.
In his opinion, it is questionable whether such a device is really useful in the event of an attack.
"If this is a prepared kidnapping, the author will almost always check whether the child wears some type of electronic device that can reveal his location."
"Now it's the phone."
"As the use of tracking devices is expanding, you will also look for them, since your sale will no doubt be made with a lot of publicity."
"In such cases, criminals always go one step ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
However, it adds that such devices can help in the case of an improvised pedophile attack.
According to Robert Čech of the RC Monitoring company, which offers tracking services for both vehicles and people, even if, after an attack, the tracking device is destroyed immediately, its presence may be helpful.
"You can configure the device to send the position regularly after a certain period."
"If you suffer damage, at least you will facilitate the last position of the person in question."
"The most expensive devices incorporate a tilt meter, so if the person simply slips and remains motionless, the device will immediately issue a warning with the position in question," Čech says.
In your opinion, such a service can be obtained even with smart mobile phones with navigation, in which only special software should be installed.
The problem with current tracking units is that for the moment these are devices with a size similar to a pair of glasses or smaller mobile phones.
So they can get lost.
According to Pilin de Macro Weil, for that reason tests are currently being carried out with devices that look like a digital clock.
"In addition, they will have the added advantage that a potential aggressor may not identify the device."
"Or identify it after some time, which can make the police gain time," he adds.
Although the tracking devices are carried in the wrist or hanging, they will continue to use the same technology used for the tracking of vehicles.
This is the position check with a GPS system (which is used in the usual navigation in the car) combined with the function of a mobile phone that communicates the current position.
The army has enough scissors to surround the entire Czech Republic, but they only last two years.
The Czech army bought 445 kilometers of wick to arrest explosives.
Last year the Ministry of Defence added to its arsenal 224 kilometres of mecca.
Therefore, they have stocks for 225 years.
The problem is that the useful life of the wick is two years, four to the top.
The army bought the explosive wick for the STV Group, a. s. for forty million crowns.
General staff responded to MF DNES justifying the purchase of such a huge amount of wick saying that soldiers need for training maneuvers 60 kilometres of wick a year.
According to the calculations of the army's pyrotechnics, with which MF DNES was contacted, it is decided, however, that, in such cases, all senior officers, including secretaries and cleaners, should perform such maneuvers with frequent use of explosives each year.
They did not want to be exempt, nor did Defence Minister Alexandr Vondr and military captain Vlastimil Picek.
Only in this way could it be justified that the army spends 60 kilometers of wick.
This length is equivalent to 25,000 explosions.
Even so, the army would have sufficient stocks for more than ten years.
If, on the contrary, as experts say, for the initial training of each new professional reaches a maximum of two meters of mecca, the army would have with the new purchase (even adding the consumption of the units of engineers or specials) sufficient stocks for the 225 mentioned above.
The soldiers of the rapid-intervention brigade had recently been personally complaining to Minister Vondra because they said they had little ammunition for various weapons, so even shooting practices for money were limited.
And let's not talk about the lack of underwear.
"I can't understand that he repeatedly buys us such quantities of wick."
"But it's their decision and they'll no doubt know why they're acting like this."
"For us, the army is a good customer to whom, as a company, we try to satisfy," STV Group's commercial director, Jan Děcký admits.
The spokesperson for the Ministry of Defence Jan Pejšek defends the hundreds of kilometres of mecca also saying he will have stocks of this "munition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký of STV Group indicates that the wick only has a useful life of four years and, in the case of pyrotechnic products for the army or police, two years.
"If it is stored in perfect conditions, it can last up to four," says one of the soldiers who, due to the possible criticisms of the army, does not want to give his name.
After the end of their useful life, each ammunition must be carefully checked to see if it remains reliable and will not harm the soldiers.
But these tests are not free and require additional investment.
Another argument of the Ministry is that when he bought 445 kilometers of mecca, he obtained a discount.
"We cost 60% less than last year's 244 kilometres order," says the spokesman Pejšek of the Ministry of Defence's shopping center.
Just to compare: the annual mecha consumption of police pyrotechnics, which eliminate the ammunition of the Second World War or left by the Soviet army, has not been more than 1,500 metres for years.
In addition, the police always demand only the fair amount to exhaust ammunition before their useful life is over.
It was decided for safety reasons for pyrotechnics and, moreover, in the meantime, more modern and reliable types of wick can be obtained.
The Ministry already has clear difficulties in ending tens of thousands of tons of ammunition at the time of the Warsaw Pact, when the Czechoslovak army of two hundred thousand people was preparing for a campaign in the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnics with whom MF DNES spoke, after a couple of years there will be the following problem with the current one: hundreds of miles of old mecca will have to be eliminated, which is now being purchased "barata".
Until now I still live from the contacts I got thanks to the competition
The fact of winning the "Empresario del Anno" contest helped Lukáš Pytloun sell the franchises of his hotel.
In the last edition, the 28-year-old entrepreneur Lukáš Pytloun of Liberec won the "Empresario of the Year" contest.
His success story seems to be taken from a film.
Lukaš Pytloun loved to travel.
Abroad realized that in Liberec there was a need for quality accommodation at a good price.
With the savings he gathered with seasonal jobs abroad and a bank credit bought a house that was half-rulled composed of five floors.
Considering that he was still studying his third year at the university, he was really brave.
"At present, the quality-price relationship of accommodation in our area moved me to do something about it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
He began renting the first floor rebuilt to foreign workers.
All the income he earned invested them again in the building, which gradually turned into a pension of 54 rooms.
Since then, in seven years in the business, it has been able to gradually open in Liberec four pensions, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of about 300 in all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of all was, until recently, the four star design hotel Pytloun.
However, this year it opened another of the same quality.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov or Tisé, to which we have sold our concept of franchise, and other people are showing interest in a franchise in Pytloun," businessman number one last year said.
"For this sale of licences for opening hotels greatly helped to win the 'Empresario del Anno' competition," adds grateful Pytloun.
The victory increased its fame and popularity both in Liberec and around.
"People recognized me on the street, they still congratulated me often and, I must say, it was very nice," he recalls.
It certainly recommends that everyone should try some company that participates in the competition.
But he believes that it is not necessary to win, but that participation is already beneficial.
He claims that so far he continues to live from contacts and acquaintances that, without the competition, he may not have obtained.
"With some people I met thanks to the competition I have begun to collaborate regularly."
The reputation associated with success, in his view, also included employees,
Totally about seventy.
"I have seen that they show greater loyalty and are proud to participate in something that gained general recognition."
"It is not, much less, my own personal success, but it is the result of the hard work of the entire team."
"It is only my name that appears in the foreground," Lukaš Pytloun says modestly today.
I wish my successor a year quieter than we had in Farmet
The euphoria for victory soon dissipated from the impact of the crisis.
Thanks to the hard work of the winner, Farmet may have already gone through the worst.
The owner of the company Farmet, Karel Ž★árský, received the first prize in the last edition of the Vodafone competition "Enprise du anno", last year at the "Casa esclava" in Prague.
The jury valued his efforts, with which he managed to turn a small technical workshop in Česka Skalice into a firm with a turnover of hundreds of millions.
"I can say that the prize not only encouraged me, but all my collaborators and improved our confidence to fight the competition," said last year's winner.
The history of Farmet starts with the desire to do something useful.
Therefore, when the State proposed to Karel's father Ž★árský the rent of a small workshop as compensation for the embargo of properties during communism, it did not hesitate too much; it gave up its position in the company in which she worked and, with a couple of companions, founded the company with her father of plastic batteries.
Shortly thereafter, they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
Eight years later they became the largest automatic press manufacturer in central Europe.
They also gained greater presence among the non-specialised public after reaching success in the media contest.
"Not only did our customers begin to regard the Farmet brand as considerably better, but foreign partners also began to value the collaboration with a company that gained greater success in their country," says Karel Ž
Last year maybe it wasn't in Farmet just a sample of the euphoria of victory.
It was also recognised for commercial results until 2008 and partly from 2009.
And just 2009 was the hardest year for the sale of machinery.
The worsening crisis, which had not yet reached so many citizens, caused companies to stop their investment projects and began to limit the purchase of new machines or technologies.
"We obviously don't get rid of this."
"The revenues were reduced by 40%, we had to limit production and even had some lay-offs," says Karel Ž★árský.
A viable company must sometimes take even unpopular measures.
However, they controlled the situation and maintained the profits of the company, although it was at lower levels than before the crisis.
In spite of everything, where Farmet did not cut expenses was in research and development.
"With the grants we have built a research and training centre, strengthened the presence in the international market and obtained magnificent evaluations at national fairs," says Ž árský.
Everything indicates they've already left the crisis behind.
Income increases again and, with them, the number of new employees.
"The new achievement is expected to bring a feeling of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere," says Karel Ž★árský.
A survey that reveals ridiculous standards
The year's absurdity survey is part of the business tournament for the fourth time.
It has already succeeded in eliminating some ridiculous rules.
The unknown winner of the new year's absurdity survey was the obligation to bring to the administration documents to which officials can access online.
The decision was adopted by more than one third of the nearly four thousand voters.
For example, the administration of social security requested an extract from the commercial register, although its officials could obtain it with two mouse movements.
Thanks to the survey, this has changed.
"The Czech administration of social security will no longer ask for an extract from the commercial register when carrying out a check on the taxes of the insured person," said ČSSZ spokesman Jana Buraňová.
The aim of the year's absurdity survey is to consult the rules and regulations that businesses and entrepreneurs in Czech Republic must respect and try to eliminate those that are absurd.
This year forms for the fourth time part of the business tournament of the publication Hospodářské noviny and begins to create affection among the general public as well.
While last year's edition had the participation of 3,000 voters, this year practically reached the four thousand.
And it is not surprising, since we still have several remaining legal obligations that must be respected simply to trade.
"Perhaps in number of roles necessary for tax reporting we are in the first place worldwide," says Karel Havlíček of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
For years, simplification of business standards has been a stated goal of all Governments.
However, compared to the rest of the world, the situation of improvement especially in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, from the point of view of the conditions for a company, Czech Republic is in position 74a, i.e. eight positions worse than last year.
The year's absurdity contest was held for the first time in 2006 and is repeated every year in the same way.
Anyone may indicate any administrative or bureaucratic absurdity every year between April and the end of September, when the contest is closed.
Proposals can be made on the website www.firmaroku.cz. Afterwards, the contest organizer chooses seven candidates for the "anti-premium" and, during October, allows the public to vote on the Internet through www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
He earns the absurdity he receives more votes.
This year's survey presented more than a hundred, in particular 105 meaningless rules and regulations.
The examples were sent by both entrepreneurs and professional associations and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, for example, was the requirement that vehicles for the maintenance of roads and highways pay the toll or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two bathrooms paint the walls every two years.
The list of the seventy proposals this year is published on the pages of the competition.
The announcement of the competition, which is always held early in November at Wenceslao Square in Prague, is part of an event in which political and social personalities usually participate.
This year, for example, they attended this event of the competition Eva Svobodová, director of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic, or Petr Kužel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Republic.
"Economic prosperity cannot be maintained if the State continues to hinder entrepreneurs, so my goal is to eliminate a minimum of thirty paragraphs each year that currently unnecessarily complicate trade," announced Minister of Industry and Commerce Martin Kocourek.
Efforts to eliminate absurd regulations are not left in rubber water.
In 2007, what bothered people most was the employer's obligation to communicate three days in advance to the business office of the permanent operating area, the intention of going to a fair or exhibition post.
This obligation was abolished in the new industrial law.
The obligation which ended second in number of votes in 2007, i.e. the communication to the work office by its foreign workers from work travel of up to 30 days, was removed from the so-called green card law.
And the third one's gonna beat it.
The 2009 Absurdity was the regulation for physiotherapists to have in their consultation a large mirror, a refrigerator and two soil scales.
Therefore, this year the Ministry of Health issued a communication saying that it had eliminated the obligation to have a refrigerator.
A new category recognizes socially responsible companies
Ecological, humanitarian, educational or sports projects are valued.
The novelty in this fifth edition of the Hospodářské noviny contest is the category called Company responsible for 2010.
The task of this competition is to support responsible and fair companies.
"In this way we want to support companies dealing with the impact of their activities on the environment and supporting socially responsible activities," says Patrik Bartholdy, regional director of Vodafone's mobile operator, organizer and sponsor of the competition, as in the case of the competition of the Rebel of the year.
For this new special subcategory of this year's edition of Vodafone Company's 2010 main competition, companies were introduced for which commercial success is not the only long-term objective.
The story of each of them is inspiring and would allow us to write an independent article.
Although the type of activities varies completely between one and the other, the common denominator is the support and consideration they offer.
In one case, for example, disabled persons, other personal or health problems of employees.
Among the fourteen finalists throughout the Republic were, for example, the company praguese de software Et Netera, which supports the formation of informal sports teams among its workers, who then participate in tournaments of various sports.
Another example of a company responsible for the Pardubice area is the Isolit-Bravo company, which has been the main contributor of funds to sponsor children with disabilities for seven years.
In Poděbrad, there is a paperwork that is particularly concerned about the health problems of its workers, since they constitute more than 70% of the staff; that is why it received the company title responsible for the central area of Czechia and in the Vodafone Company competition of the year ended third in the region.
In Olomouc he won the accounting company MiRyz Soft, which reduced the working hours, even below the average of 35 hours per week, without reducing wages.
The title was also awarded because it purchased mainly from Czech manufacturers, supported Community activities in the area and respected the environment.
"We try to recycle as much as possible for our production and administration activities to produce the least possible impact on the environment," explains Miluše Ryznarová.
The head IT Enlogit company in the Ústí region also thinks about the health of its employees and, with each laptop, offered them an ergonomic chair and keyboards; furthermore, it supports the work from home and in its business events uses the catering services of a local protected company.
"In addition, we support the Persona grant in distress, which specifically helps the local Roma community," comments the representative of the company Ondřej Suchý.
They are also well placed with a mention of the Prani laundry company in čištění in the Karlovy Vary region, whose employees receive bonuses in a special way that affects their pension funds.
"We give benefits in food, transportation, improvement of qualifications and leisure," says Josef Strapáč, of the construction company of Bruntál Czasch, winner in the Moravia-Silesia region.
In the Company category responsible for the year, all the regional finalists of the Vodafone Company contest were automatically appointed in the year which responded to the questions of the registration form and sent it to the organizers before 15 August.
The organizers removed forms that were not complete or incorrect from the evaluation.
"If the representatives of the competing companies did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the Company competition responsible for the year, but are not disqualified from the "principal" competition Vodafone Company of the year."
"Individual applications for this competition are not allowed, since this is a subcategory of the main Business competition of the year," explains Karel Goldman of the Bison & Rose consultancy.
Police arrested during a public auction in the Agricultural Fund building in Pilsen
The Anti-Corruption Police conducted several arrests in the Agricultural Fund building in recent days.
The detectives handcuffed a local media entrepreneur and real estate entrepreneur Luboš G.
It seems that this attempt to manipulate an ongoing public auction for the refund of rights in such a way that the substantiated land receives it from a precise interested person.
I should have paid Luboš G. half a million crowns for this.
"For the moment I can only say that the police are looking for a person for bribe during a public auction and public tender," said Provo the Chief Attorney General of Pilsen Antonie Zelená, adding that for the moment he cannot disclose more details about the ongoing investigation.
After 24 hours, the police released the 46-year-old entrepreneur.
On how it could influence the public auction, given the little official information, it can only be speculated.
The spokesman for the Lubomíra Agricultural Fund Černá answered the questions of Provo saying that the police actually carried out the arrest at Pilsen headquarters and went during a public auction.
"It's a customer, not one of our workers," he said.
According to Černá, the public auction is called "Call for proposals for land transfer in accordance with the land law" and is carried out when several interested parties appear in relation to the land offered.
"These persons, during the call, offer a value greater than their refund, which must be transferred before the value of the land is announced."
"On the basis of the offers, the order of the buyers is determined and the Agricultural Fund then transfers the land to the person offering the largest offer," explained the Fund spokesman.
Luboš G. had information on who was to be submitted to the summons and, at the same time, he was interested in acquiring various refund rights, proposed to interested parties in the field that he would not participate in the auction.
Please, he was charging a commission.
This would explain that at the time of the arrest, he had so much money on it.
Luboš G. had special contacts in the Pilsen Fund for a long time.
It was in the case of the former head of PF Václav Sankot, who was accused of dispatching the replacement of land for which a construction decision had already been issued.
For example, Luboš G. has just obtained from the Fund planned land for the construction of public infrastructure, particularly in the place where a large road to the industrial area of Borská pole should be built.
Later, he traded them in a very beneficial way with the magistrate for a house in the city's own historic center with a much higher value.
In this case, the city had to intervene because, otherwise, the blocked land would prevent construction.
Families will have to pay additional costs of several hundred crowns per month
Households will have to pay since January not only for all types of energy, but also for water and electricity, heating supplements and, in some cases, higher rents.
Hence, families will have to take several hundred crowns from the portfolio from January onwards more than now.
The price of electricity increases by 4.6 per cent, gas by around 2 per cent, in some cities they must pay up to 10 per cent more for water supply and many also increase the price of central heating.
The rise in electricity for families living in apartments should amount to about 100 crowns a year more than now.
However, the main electricity suppliers reduced prices due to increased support for renewable energy production, in particular photovoltaics.
However, gas is moderately high, especially at the time when heating is most used and therefore higher is consumption.
In this case, they must also have a couple hundred crowns more a year.
While electricity and gas are being maintained throughout the country, the change in central heating prices varies from place to place.
The rise in prices is mainly planned by the largest municipality.
For example, the homes of Pardubice or Hradec Kralové will pay for central heating from January about 50 more per month, while the families of Liberec will pay more than 1,000 additional crowns per year.
Residents in Prague must also bear a 9 per cent increase in water and heating prices, especially if the city increases the rental of infrastructure.
If the rental does not vary, the pests will pay an additional 6.8%.
Prices in Prague, however, will remain among the lowest in the country.
In northern Bohemia, where current prices are among the highest, both rates will rise by 7.4%.
Prices of rent can be considerably increased by 450,000 apartments rented in Prague, where the regulation will end in January.
For example, CPI Byty, which owns in Ustí nad Labem about 2,500 floors, will increase the rent from January to 100%.
The company shall bring to the courts those who do not agree with the new rental.
Regular rents, which benefit residents of about 300,000 floors, could increase the coming year to 10%.
Czech young people get drunk with Fernet and rum. Beer is no longer fit, because it takes effect slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka and even good whiskeys stolen from their parents.
These are the drinks that cause them to end up in medical care young drinkers under the age of fifteen.
Children who end up in the hospital continuously to overcome the hangover are no longer an exception.
This is derived from the experience of doctors who encounter such cases in admissions of pediatrics from the hospital.
"Drinking beer or wine is no longer fashionable, because it takes a long time to get drunk."
"Now fashion is strong alcoholic beverages," says the head of pediatrics at Hořovice Hospital in downtown Bohemia, Luděk Pelikán.
"When they get a bottle to their father from the latch, it can be whiskey, but it's usually Fernet and vodka."
"The vodka has the advantage of smoothing with juice and not smelling so much," he explains.
It is also confirmed by the spokesperson for the University Hospital Motol, Eva Jurinová.
"Normally, it's usually Fernet or rum."
"These are modern alcoholic beverages, particularly among schoolchildren."
"In some cases, they use aguardant that they caught at home," Jurinová adds.
According to Chief Pelikán, 13 - and 14 - year - old drinkers usually appear in hospitals.
Before Hořovice, where he has worked since this year, worked for a decade in pediatrics in Motol, where ambulances took young people from nearby areas.
"A girl had to come in maybe four times."
"It began at 12 years of age, when it was brought with 3.5 alcohol in blood, in addition to a mixture with ecstasy," says the department doctor on this case.
"He was at the Holešovice fair at some dance party."
"The interesting thing is that his mother didn't even surprise him that his daughter disappeared for 48 hours," the boss was surprised.
It is precisely the lack of interest of parents or even their clear tolerance to drink by their children that is considered the main cause of increased alcohol consumption among young people.
Experts point out that, in the case of children, it is not possible to speak of dependence itself.
"A person who has had a chronic alcohol dependence for several years is understood as an alcoholic, with all the phenomena associated with alcohol, which is not produced in children."
"In those who drink alcohol repeatedly, rather it is due to a systematically failed social or family environment," explains Chief Pelikán.
According to Spokesperson Jurinová, this year at Motol's pediatric clinic they were hospitalized until mid-November forty drunken children.
However, statistics show only those who are suffering from serious poisoning and should remain in the hospital.
Young drinkers who, after travelling medical recognition, go home to their parents or to the police, don't count.
In addition to cases where children simply gather after school and drink bright drinks, for Pelikán there are three seasonal elevations that should be mentioned: witch day, End of Year and end of school.
"In such circumstances, they drink by bad notes or, on the contrary, celebrate the start of the holiday."
"On the day of the witches I have come to see in admissions up to seven drunken children at once," adds Pelikán.
Drinkers who spend the night in detoxification under the supervision of doctors, paradoxically, have the advantage that the next day they do not suffer a terrible hangover at home.
Morning headache caused by dehydration and lack of glucose is avoided by injection of a serum with glucose and nutrients that are missing the body.
"They wear it a lot better, because after the restless night, they get up well and they don't hurt anything."
"They are only confused about where they are," says Pelikán, adding that patients often lose their good mood at least when they see the expenses they have generated.
Ambulance transfer and hospitalization in a room for serious patients cost about ten thousand crowns.
"I have often used the cost as a means of educating them, when on the visit I tell the children directly how much it has cost them their drunkenness and they would have to spend all summer at a job for young people to earn enough to pay that night," Pelikán adds.
Medical insurance, in your opinion, may be a retroactive measure, which usually returns the costs of treatment to people, does not do so in the case of children who drink.
Two L-159 aircraft are first found in foreign hands in Spain
Two L-159 aircraft of a total of five, for which the Czech Ministry of Defence replaced House C-295M aircraft, departed on Tuesday for Seville, where the manufacturer of the aircraft Casa - EADS is located.
This is the first time a device of this type is in the hands of someone other than the Czech army.
For the time being, they were only abroad to conduct practical or demonstration flights.
This is the two-sided version L-159T1, which so far used the Czech army and was still in a state of flight.
The remaining three aircraft are L-159.
These are still kept in Aer Vodochody and the sales intermediary, Omnipol, already took care of them last week.
Jan Peješk, of the defense press department, indicates that it is not yet known when the physical planes of Vodochody will be withdrawn.
"The L-159 single-seater aircraft, on the other hand, were separated from the aircraft repaired long ago, without additional investments or contributions by the Ministry."
"The L-159T1 biplaces exchanged in their current state," he told Prevo Pejšek.
He added that the army did not run out of two aircraft, since in May 2009 the army signed a contract with Aer Vodochody for 200 million crowns for the construction of four unnecessary L-159 two-seater devices.
One of the new planes already received it by the army in July, the other will be delivered at the end of the year.
According to Pejšek, EADS undertook to add aircraft to the equipment of some Allied countries.
"The contract clearly indicates that the EADS company is the one that withdraws L-159 aircraft and will serve for the practice of pilots from NATO countries."
"It is therefore up to the buyer to decide how to use them in this context," notes Pejšek.
The newspaper Hospodářské noviny published before time that, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for one home plane and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns was approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defence did not convene a bid for purchase and negotiated directly with EADS.
The current defence direction states that the exchange promotes the future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army acquired Aer 72 aircraft and only uses 24, so it wants to sell the rest.
Buying House planes may have legal consequences.
The European Commission has already denounced the Czech Ministry of Defence to the European Court of Justice because it should choose aircraft by conducting a European tender and not contacting a single manufacturer.
The army has already received three home planes and the last one should arrive at Kbely's Prague airport in fourteen days.
A longer index finger than the annull indicates a lower risk of cancer
Men who have the longest rate than the annular are subject to a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the startling conclusion of a study published on Wednesday in a British journal on cancer.
They could depend on testosterone level, male hormone.
"Our results indicate that the relative length of the finger can be a simple test of the risk of prostate cancer, particularly for men up to 60 years of age," said the co-author of the Ros Eeles study, professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at Warwick University.
Therefore, the finger could help determine which men should undergo a prostate cancer test, particularly if this feature is associated with a genetic risk or other harmful factors, such as family health problems, according to Eeles.
During the period 1994-2009, he followed up with a British counterpart of more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had a shorter right-hand index finger than the annular finger.
They presented the same probability of prostate cancer as 19% of those whose fingers were of the same length.
In the case of men with a longer rate than the annular finger, this risk was reduced by 33 per cent; for men below 60 per cent the reduction reached 87 per cent.
The relationship between the length of the two fingers in question, determined in the prenatal period, reflects different levels of hormones to which the fetus is exposed in the matrix.
A lower testosterone level corresponds to a longer index.
Previous studies indicated that testosterone influences the development of prostate cancer.
The great Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, Professor Václav Pačes, told ČTK that he knows the study, but that it does not seem to him that the relationship between finger length and cancer can be "shown completely".
The Czech Republic under snow: D1 and D5 are closed
Czech Republic, like most Europeans, dawned on Thursday covered by snow.
The roads and sidewalks are mostly covered by compact snow and the Quitanie machines circulated all night through numerous areas.
In the morning the D5 road between miles 89 and 93 towards Rozvadov was closed due to several accidents of industrial vehicles and tourism, as was the D1 in Brno towards Prague.
The news transmitted them by the operator of the Ústředního autotoklubu (UAMK).
In km 91 a truck was hit, in 93 two industrial vehicles were impacted, causing injury.
Several tourists also ended up in the country.
There are also problems in the D1 motorway in the 185 km towards Prague.
Two trucks hit there.
Drivers should travel slowly after Brno within 190 km or through Brno and be incorporated into Kývalce in 182 km.
Several kilometres have been blocked there.
There has also been an accident on the D11 road, right next to Prague.
Prague is covered by a multi-centimeter snow layer and thermometers indicate -7 oC.
For example, they are being blocked in Prosek, although Štěrboholská is also congested.
The safest means of transport is the subway.
The trams circulate with delay, for example on the line between Karlovo náměstí and Náměstí Míru.
At eight in the morning, another state of crisis will take place in Prague.
The problems also affect railways and airport.
Due to the snow, the Czech railway company had to cancel seven connections by three fasts.
The problems affect, for example, the line between Prague and Kralupy or Prague and Beroun.
Travellers should check the current situation.
The Ruzyně airport was closed from 11 a.m. on Wednesday night until 5 a.m.
At present, most roads in southern Moravia can already be moved, but with extreme caution.
In Vyškovska three secondary roads are closed to traffic, in Brněnska snow languages are being formed and in Blanenska chains are needed to access certain routes of access to the highest points.
One of the most affected places was Vyškovsko.
Until now the connections are closed: Rousinov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
Milling machines will be required to remove them.
At the moment it cannot be said when they will open up to circulation.
In Hodonínska, caution is required in the area of Bílé Karpathy (White Carpathians).
The roads in the region which, since it is a protected natural zone, must simply be left inert, accumulate up to five centimeters of snow, according to ČTK.
In Czechia they fell between two and ten centimeters of snow, plus in northern Bohemia, where the snow layer reaches 18 centimeters.
In the Moravia-Silesia region, about 15 centimeters of snow fell.
The snows are gradually flowing back into Czechia.
American soldiers have a new "smart weapon"
The American army is using in Afghanistan a new "intelligent" weapon, known at the moment only by the coded name XM-25.
The generals hope that the new rifle will influence the local conflict with the Taliban and that "change the progress of the game" will make its victory.
The new weapons are like a small gun and with an extremely accurate aim.
His bullets are fired with a laser with a precision of several meters.
The special 25 mm-calibre ammunition created for this rifle and the high load of explosives it contains causes it actually to work as a small grenade.
Projectiles can be programmed to explode not only when they hit the target, but at any point in their ballistic path.
They can be used against enemies hiding behind an obstacle, wall or trenches.
Without a doubt, normal protection cannot be used, and when it throws out its murderous shower of metal astillas, it can be essential in the battle.
According to Richard Audette, who spoke about the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first weapon for infantry using "intelligent" technology.
"The soldiers manipulate it in such a way that they find the goal, point to the same laser beam, which determines the distance, then obtains a precise point of sight and, depending on it, corrects the projection line and tightens the trigger."
"Let's say it's been 543 meters."
"When the trigger is pressed, the gun is loaded and the projectile is thrown at a distance of 543 meters, plus one, two or three meters," says Audette.
400 jobs are transferred
Fujitsu transferred his branch to Bad Homburg, Frankfurt.
In July of the following year, 400 employees will change their workplace from their previous office building in the Marinenbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
Japan’s Fujitsu consortium transfers its branch to Bad Homburg in Frankfurt.
As reported by the giant computer sector and its maintenance on Wednesday, 400 men and women will be moved in July from their previous office building in Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large office complex on Lyoner Straße Street in Niederrad district in Frankfurt.
A spokesperson from Fujitsu explained that in the medium term, another 100 more employees of the consortium, who were previously scattered throughout the region, will be accommodated there.
The offer is highly attractive, and the collective office in Astro Park will favor the way employees work.
In addition, Fujitsu will be the only tenant in Bad Homburg.
Director Bernd Wagner said, "in Franfkurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with an excellent infrastructure".
The brilliant connection to the airport is currently very important for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of an important company in the region caused yesterday joy among those who were in favour and disappointment among those who were against.
The head of the Frankfurt Economics Section, Markus Frank (CDU) said that this has won a Global Player.
This is a "magnificent recognition of the site".
Fujitsu sits in the city, settlement is a great boost for Niederrad.
Bod Hombruger's mayor, Michael Korwisi (Greens) regrets Fujitsu's decision.
The management informed the city earlier about its intention.
"We have naturally offered our aid to the company," Korwisi said.
However, the good contacts of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property in Marienbader Platz have not been able to change in the difficulties.
After all, economic reasons produced the fall.
In such a way, now there is a great empty place to cover in the famous post.
"I hope that the owner and tenant of the building will show cooperatives."
The building previously used by Fujitsu at Rathausplatz and the neighboring "Kleine Vertikale" had been part of the remaining buildings of Marienbader Platz for ten years of a controversial construction project in the seaside city.
As a joint project of the city and a private project company between the station and the city council, a new entrance to the city is formed, which takes care of the criticism of the massive building used previously as parking spaces and as regards the level of buildings.
In 2001 the investment consultancy and taxation companies were installed, the software manufacturer for booking systems, Start Amadeus, as well as then joined Siemens with the Fujitsu computer manufacturer home.
In 2006, the building used by Fujitsu was acquired by the real estate group of Frankfurt, Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Groupe along with Morgan Stanley Real Estate and a year later resold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
Fujitsu consortium, coming from Tokyo, is recognized as the third largest IT provider in the world.
It has companies, such as computers and servers, and also provides precise services.
The branch in Rhein-Main-Gebiet is one of the largest in Germany, however Fujitsu has more business in Munich.
The Fujitsu Technology Solutions subsidiary is installed from Bad Homburg in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the following subsidiaries in this place will be Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
That's why 7,000 square meters have been rented in the Astro Park office building.
The old complex of the 1920s, its name refers to its star-shaped plane, houses among others the central electrotechnical association and the electronic industry.
Amazon cancels the server - Threats against Assange
Anxiety is increasingly taking over Wikileaks.
The Amazon Internet Service Provider has removed the disclosure platform from your server.
Possibly behind it is political pressure following the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic documents.
Assange, the founder of Wikileaks, is reportedly arrested in England.
The Wikileaks revelation platform is always the target of criticism, ever stronger in the United States.
Internet activists lost access to their former American server and are currently looking for an Internet homeland in Europe.
The well-known American senator, Joe Lieberman, calls other countries and businesses to the boycott of Wikileaks.
And the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, on the list of people sought from Interpol, must remain in custody in Britain, according to an article.
"Wikileaks expelled from the Amazon server."
"Speak freely in the country of freedom," the activists of the revelations reported via the Twitter messaging service on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the internet company, Amazon, had deleted Wikileaks documents from its server.
Internet activists had resorted to the publication of secret diplomatic documents to the Amazon service web in order to be able to deal with the high numbers of access to documents.
On Twitter, Wikileaks explained the following: "Perfect, we'll use our dollars to hire people in Europe."
If Amazon has problems with freedom of expression, "they should stop selling books."
Amazon stopped using its server via Wikileaks, after an employee of Senator Joe Lieberman had requested investigations, reported the CNN chain according to a call to the Lieberman office.
The president of the Senate's security council had threatened Amazon with boycott, said the British "Guardian".
"I wanted Amazon to take these measures before, before previous publications of information classified through Wikileaks," said the senator.
Lieberman also requested that the platform also prohibit the use of the server in other countries.
"The illegal, monstrous and thoughtless Wikileaks process puts our national security at stake and threatens life in the world," stated an independent senator's communiqué.
"No responsible company, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks with their service to extend stolen material.
The founder of Wikileaks, Assange, who is sought in Sweden for suspicion of rape, is on the list of people sought from Interpol.
According to an article in the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian is detained in Britain, Scotland Yard knows the exact place.
The internet activist has consistently described research in Sweden as a plot of his enemy.
Wikileaks spokesperson Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that there were threats.
"There were even calls about a murder of Julian Assange."
That's why he's afraid of Assange's safety, Hrafnsson said.
Therefore, the location of the Wikileaks founder remains undisclosed.
Hrafnsson obviously reacted to North America's statements.
In America, former Republican Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, stated that the responsible for Wikileaks' revelations must be judged for treason and executed.
In Canada, he said a chief advisor Stephen Harper, clearly ironically on television, Assange should be "murdered" and Obama could "use a drone."
Between the White House and Assange there is a great dispute.
Robert Gibbs, spokesperson for American President Barack Obama, described Assange as "ridiculous and absurd" that she had applied for the resignation of the state secretary, in case she was responsible for ordering diplomats who were involved in spying tasks recently.
"I'm not entirely sure why we should care about a guy's opinion with a website," Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much stronger than their website."
The US government has to demonstrate the effectiveness of the protection of its databases in general.
Russell Travers, deputy director of distribution of the National Counter-Terrorism Centre, was appointed exceptional manager, announced the White House.
Thus Travers is responsible for developing "the important structural reforms", which are necessary in the light of Wikileaks' filtration.
The White House also wants to inspect the roads, as well as change the total information about the government and protect it.
In addition, the American government announced that to ensure the safety of dissidents and activists, the publication of Wikileaks must be put at risk.
"We have done everything we can to get in touch with them," said State Department spokesperson Philip Crowley.
"We are prepared to help protect them if necessary."
The University of Ice cream
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna ice cream is prepared at the best times of the year.
The basic three-day course for future ice cream has the highest attendance and visitors from all over the world.
Where does the whole ice cream actually come from?
Ice cream and ice cream.
The ice cream produces cream according to all the rules of Italian art of making ice cream.
The ice cream pulls out with a spatula the ice cream from the counter, spreads it over the boat and sells it.
To know this, you don't need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about ice cream should not visit the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The manufacturer has equipped the ice cream university with the freezer in 2003, so that the ice cream of his machines meets the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The basic three-day course for future ice cream has the highest attendance and visitors from all over the world.
There are also more special courses of more days on chocolate ice cream and practices in the ice cream shop of the house itself.
In these times of crisis, some dream of a new career, others risk their vague desires in the mild ice cream.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries across all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia passing through Hungary.
Jacky, professor of this California art, loves the slow movement of food and in the future wants to offer a quality European product on the land of the industrial ice cream.
Anke, from Berlin, is a business advisor and wants to create something of her own in a few years in an annoying job.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening a ice cream shop in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil wants to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars, and a Canadian housewife, Julia, comes because their children love Italian ice cream.
The ice cream master Luciano Ferrari later explains the ideal qualities of the perfect ice cream.
It is not only its good taste decisive, but also its silky softness and its good consistency.
Luciano does not forget its formation or the cream cover of the national upper house and mainly of the southern part of the country: "Italian ice cream is simply the best, and that's why every ball has something romantic."
The first step to the elaboration seems very easy.
Luciano throws the basic ingredients: milk, cream, powdered milk, sugar and stabilizers in a big beater, which heats everything with an electronic program up to 85 degrees and currently cools it up to four degrees.
Then open the machine tap and come out a basic pasteurized white cream, the basis for all types of milk ice cream.
Suddenly, the teacher asks: Can ice cream be processed only with natural elements or without stabilizer?
How can you give free rein to some desire to experience?
Luciano advises them to get rid of the trends of the time.
The one who speaks of ice cream "not only of natural ingredients", has at best used stabilizers, mainly a natural product, probably guar rubber, of bezel guar.
Of course you can manufacture ice cream without stabiliser, only buy it one day, place it in a bag and the customer will bite a granite ice cream sound.
Certain variations in the basic mass are allowed.
Scents are used.
As for the taste of ice cream, Master Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients that are purchased in the fruit or sweets section of the supermarket.
In addition, there are dusts and pastes.
"All suppliers will try to paste flavoured ingredients into their merchandise."
"But they must sometimes experience it."
Whether with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or even with the cream ice cream of the basic white mass, which with eggs will become a yellow cream and with cocoa powder as a basis for all possible chocolate pleasures.
Now the course participants can use the ice cream machines.
Luciano lets them develop four different types of vanilla ice cream, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut, with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural ingredients.
They also perform the same experiment with types of fruit ice cream.
Knowing better does not necessarily depend on having more tofe aroma or more pure fruit.
There is no need for hazelnut ice cream to know about dried fruits, if it contains more hazelnuts.
The working group produces the adorable kiwi ice cream, which uses more fruits, less water and something less stabilizer.
First a balanced mixture highlights the taste of ice cream, says Luciano.
Icemaking is a problem of artimetics: The melocoton puree is used with a lot of sugar, the proportion of sugar in the basic recipe must be lowered.
For the lemon ice cream it takes an extra portion of sugar.
Luciano takes out a tool with which to fix the amount of sugar of the types of fruit (measurement of the wine grower for Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately the tables facilitate the account.
Icemaking requires no more than physical application, as before.
It not only helps the tool for the automatic elaboration of the basic mass.
There is also a tool, in which the mixture of prepared ice cream is simultaneously beaten and cooled to a temperature below zero.
In spite of everything, all automation remains out on the small paste.
Brazilian Gustavo stains himself and his companions from top to bottom with fruit puré, as if it were a giant miniprimer without control.
"In all courses," says Master Luciano, "it's just a matter of time that something like this happens."
Inspectors in a complicated situation
The European Food Safety Authority Efsa has infiltrated the transgenic plant industry.
This issue is currently formulated by the Expert Group Testbiotech, which is considered an independent institute for the assessment of the impact of biotechnology.
"It looks like a conspiracy theory but we haven't documented it properly," said Christoph Thenn, Director of Testbiotech, on Wednesday in Munich.
Harry Kuiper, the director of the Efsa group of experts on genetically modified plants, and another Efsa expert have also been employed for years in the Ilsi association.
Consortiums like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer cost him.
Kuiper has collaborated significantly in the Efsa test standards of genetically modified plants, which puts him in a clear conflict of interest, criticising Then.
The Efsa provisions are in paragraphs with the same terms as the documentation of the situation of Ilsi and imitate the company's writing, which is actually controlled by its Italian authorities in Parma.
This is the second time that Testbiotech criticizes a collision of interests.
So recently, a high-ranking Efsa manager was without the support or transition time to Swiss Agrarkonzern Syngenta, and has changed with that his side.
Recently, Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) also revealed personal connections between the EU inspection authorities and industry, which carried out the General Environment Office and a clear EU parliamentary clairvoyance.
However, Ephsa cannot recognize any conflict of interest.
All formal data are used, including some of the industry, provided they are of high quality and technical quality, and are ordered in a report.
Experts working in Efsa are not required to have any contact with the industry.
But they must expose these contacts.
Kuiper supports his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States
It is called itself a neutral forum for experts and science, industry and politics, among others for the risk assessment for biotechnology without the burden of Lobby.
In this issue, independent experts, such as Thenn, criticise that transgenic plants are currently allowed without investigating animal food and that the influence of genetically modified plants on the environment is not verified.
"We want to know what, for example, does genetically modified maize in agriculture," says Thenn.
The current practice is to check only isolated proteins, but not the entire transgenic plant, which does not provide reliable results.
"If you're not looking for the risks, how are you going to find them?" asks, accuser, Then.
Angelina Hilbeck feels the same way.
Since 1994, scientists have been investigating the field of genetic engineering and are currently working at the Technical Institute in Zurich.
In this area, industry is increasingly trying, in the United States and Europe, to influence or discredit critical scientists.
Therefore, few scientists are not influenced by consortia.
For companies, critical studies are not published as a general rule.
"The industry controls security research," says Hilbeck.
The Trace of the Stones
Uli Gsell has achieved some, in total, about 400 kilos.
On Monday he was in front of Stuttgart station, with the Tuba on his back.
There were demonstrations
Nevaba.
The story is known: In September the excavators arrived and began to take down a large piece of the north wing.
The land of Stuttgart never again became the same: Thousands and thousands protested against the s21, the suspension of millions at the station.
As it was fastened, most of the wing became rubble.
It rotates in 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a rough soft stone, raised between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
A couple pieces have been secured.
"These stones are relics."
"They mustn't disappear."
He is excited: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and natural."
As he once said, he smelled cigarette smoke.
He still doesn't know what he'll do with the pieces.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The trail of Stuttgart's stones leads to a forest in Tubingen in a former French Navy ammunition warehouse, where Manuel Rongen erected his Stein-Reich stone.
The 44-year-old man deals with ancient stones.
He bought everything that resulted from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"He would be disgraced, would grind the gravel or send it to the garbage dumpster," he says in his office, a wooden house that once was a watchhouse.
He was insulted and threatened, explains, when, in September, he appeared in the newspapers, that he had bought the remains of the northern wing to the downfall company.
He spoke to the 21S enemies for several days.
And he explained to them that he could do absolutely nothing about the downfall.
And when it happened, then it was most reasonable, when the stones continued to be used.
About 200 S21 enemies took the 80-kilometre maxis, with a price per piece from 6.50 to 14 euros.
Some took it as a memory but also in the hope of being able to return it in a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, a load of 25 trucks.
About half is still in the forest, the rest of it was sold a long time ago.
Garden owner, landscape gardener, project manager.
They arrived everywhere and took what they could carry in the trunk and above.
The Stuttgart stone of the impulse has long become "the wall" or the delimitation of Kräuterbeeten.
"This stone is really nothing special," Rongen says.
"If it wasn't for the political component."
He ascends to his whole earth, makes a tour of his great kingdom of 20 hectares.
He studied law, interrupted his studies, and later biology, interested him in computers and finally worked with stones.
And he's a stone lover.
It houses 4,000 tons of stone.
Carry your treasures all over Germany.
He says he's the biggest ancient stone dealer in the country.
Slow down.
In the snow there are artistic sandstones bitten.
"They belonged to the bridge of Dresden Marienbrücke," he explains.
Caliza alba, yellow, warm, enthusiastic.
"My dear stone."
The road crosses the forest.
Mark a pile: Red sandstone, an earlier piece of Karlsruhe station.
And go on.
"Bonito travertino."
In the past, the solids belonged to the Stuttgart Neckarstadion tribune.
Everywhere in the snow, stones and stories, yellow travertine of the police chief of Stuttgart, red granite of the church Sankt Blasien, toba of the hospital of Heilbronner.
What a job, what an effort, what a sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how he carved the stones before and moved them with a simple device and a cart, he feels very devoted.
"It would be a scandal if something were destroyed."
He hasn't become rich, at all immensely rich.
But today 14 people gave the stone dealer a place to do, as well as canteens, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a window and a gardener have settled up in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's satisfactory," says the man who takes care of taking advantage of the remains.
Soon you have to go to Cologne.
There are also stones to rescue.
Fighting talents around great potentials
There's an active fluency in the buffet.
16 students are crowded around the pancakes, tomato soup and sweets.
Braunschweig Technical University and Vokswagen Car Manufacturer have invited mechanical engineering and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of idea contest, they have to talk about the car of the future with VW workers and also learn all about Volkswagen.
Rivalizing and in the same way, many companies, like VW, meet in a body-to-body struggle around the most privileged minds in collaborations with universities.
Your mission: Hire the most talented students in universities as soon as possible before they enter the labour market and are hired by others.
And since universities do not provide publications on their students’ skills, they try to add exceptional talents to practical projects and capture them.
On the second day of project at the Technical University of Braunscheig, the consortium wins talent.
A lady in the staff department distributes pens, elbows and folders with the VW logo.
Explains to the curious young talents the practices and work programs for students and shows them their paths in the consortium.
Nico Selle from Braunschweig Technical University carries the project with VW.
See advantages for both sides: "Students come into contact with industry and gain experience."
"In turn, VW can meet students, observe interesting candidates more closely and consider them as potential future workers."
Some collaborations, Selle says, are not uncommon.
The novelty is that students are so directly desired.
"The main point was previously in the technical projects," Selle says.
The fight for fresh graduates is getting harder.
In many branches, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large group of applicants.
If not they have to be announced and, above all, to get a highly qualified workforce.
All engineering discipline students are in an excellent negotiating situation.
According to the German Association of Engineers (VDI for its acronyms in German), there were 40,000 vacant engineers in October.
And according to the VDI forecasts, this gap of engineers will grow even further.
In the audit and advisory company, KPMG, Roman Dykta is responsible for hunting talent.
It organizes costly recruitment events, such as the KPMG race, a type of modern yincan, in which participants have to find their way through GPS coordinates.
The company wants to send eight very promising students to the US the following year.
In addition, participants can observe KPMG subsidiaries and learn about the company.
It is decided who should go in two rounds of choice at the exit.
Only the cream cream of many participants goes to the United States.
Universities are increasingly striving to choose and polish the high potentials of universities, according to Dykta.
"With the race we want to highlight the mass."
"The simple journey alone was short for us."
For hunter Dykta notes give results.
"To this day we have similar action in the past year with all the participants."
"Some people are near their end, and they want to ask to work with us," he says.
In addition to the direct approach on the campus, they are also hunting, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, classic with their labor fairs.
"We try to get students at specialized fairs."
"Something about Intersolar," says Sitha Stübe, in charge of personnel for solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
Bonner has approximately 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the problem of the new generation.
At present, 35 vacant posts appear on the company's website.
"It is very complicated to fill vacancies."
"It costs a lot of time and money," he says.
A shorter path is contact with university teachers.
Solarworld collaborates with several higher schools, such as Freiberg University.
"Teachers advise that they can do practice with us or carry out their theses.
There are no expensive advertising campaigns for solar specialists.
That's why the company needs to be promoted with other advantages: personal environment, flat hierarchy and convenient communication.
"A great consortium cannot normally offer it," says Stübe, the staff manager.
In the search for a job, money is no longer the most important thing.
The decisive factors are flexible working hours, assistance to children or good promotion possibilities.
According to a study by the Great Place to Work Institutes, Solarworld boasts 55th place among the 100 best employers in Germany.
The Institute draws up an annual list of the best German job providers.
For what the employee asks how satisfied he is with the work and the environment in the same and observes the previous conditions of the employees.
Stübe, the staff manager also expects extra points in his classification by his aspirants to work.
"I think the applicant is particularly fixed in the external classifications of a potential employer," he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of Deutschen Employer Branding Akademie advises companies who want a long-term strategy that earn a good reputation as employers.
Give your customers more authenticity.
And that means, according to Kriegler, above all, internal measures.
"The best way to become attractive as an employer passes through the employees themselves," he says.
In the sector manager is called Internal Branding Employer, also promoting corporate identity within the staff.
"One satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
When you treat people well and identify them with the company, then you get promotion directly to the employer by friends and acquaintances.
"It's like a gang game," Kriegler says.
Obama arrests new oil drilling
From the coast of the U.S. state of Florida to the Gulf of Mexico has not appeared in these years any new oil drilling.
The Washington government issued a strong ban, and with this it completely reversed its previous plans.
Also in the face of the Atlantic coast are new drillings closed by the moment.
This announced the Minister of the Interior, Ken Salazar, on Wednesday.
What caused this strict ban, which will at least be in force for the next five years, is the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil platform in April.
Before the misfortune that cost eleven workers their lives and caused the greatest environmental catastrophe in the United States, President Barack Obama had admitted new drillings in the western part of the Gulf of Mexico under pressure from the opposition and industry.
The supporters thus wanted to reduce the dependence of the United States on new foreign oil supplies.
To date it has not been fully clear who is responsible for the irreparable black tide in the Gulf.
At the heart of the criticism is the British energy consortium BP, which is facing millions of demands.
A committee of inquiry commissioned by Obama will present its results in December.
In October, Ken Salazar, the interior minister, lifted the perforation moratorium after the explosion.
Subsequently, various peteroler consortia submitted applications for further drilling attempts.
Obama and Salazar want to rule out a new catastrophe using tougher controls and stricter security regulations.
At present, the responsible supervisory authority, which has been accused of corruption charges has fallen into disrepute, is reformed by root.
Obama also announces that there will be a closure of the profit tax gaps for oil and gas consortia.
The industry publicly announces that the total extraction in the Gulf will be lower thanks to stricter regulation, to date.
"The government's plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industries," says the result of the current survey carried out by the advisory company BDO - before the ban on the extraction of Wednesday.
American Energy Alliance complains about insecurity in the sector: "No one knows exactly what changes with regulation."
Investments in new extraction projects are soon extended, to the detriment of growth.
Ogonilandia is ruined
The water of the rivers is oil brown, smells like a gas station: Millions of liters of crude spills have destroyed nature in the Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live from theft, corruption and illegal oil trade.
Celestine Akpobari looks good.
"Don't get tired," the environmental activist reassures journalists: "Today enough oil will pass before your eyes."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has managed to photograph boys walking in the water to the chest with the brightness of the lights reflected in turbulence on the surface: With the colorful brightness of the water, the scene looks almost beautiful.
There is no evidence that brown oil stains float on the surface.
He used to pick up prawns here, explains Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the fluid waters are totally dead.
Five years ago, an impressive amount of oil was poured into the formidable wetlands by a broken pipe.
The fish in the vicinity of the small town of Bodo had to swim six hours to reach waters full of fish: That, in the heart of the Niger Delta and located in Ogoniland, is considered one of the most stinky regions in the world.
On the way through the river passing through mangroves, the extensive desolation is obvious.
Instead of clear water, the boat's engine removes a brown broth, which dips its hand in the water, will bring out some oily stuff.
The roots of the mangrove trees rise from the ground as dark licorice sticks, sadly isolate the palm trees that shock and hang their palms.
In vain they seek bands of birds, as if they were in the wetlands as usual: As soon as the barrier of the outside is silenced, a sort of ghostly calm of an earlier paradise with the smell of gas.
"What happens here is an ecological struggle," says Celestine Akpobari, "We live in constant danger for health."
The war compares.
The settlement area of the ogoni has been a resounding battlefield for years: Here the first European explorers were raided more than 60 years ago, here was organized the first resistance in the 1980s with writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, later executed, here he had to place his first factory the Shell consortium in 1993, because it would be too dangerous for oil employees.
Even today, the return of companies to Ogoniland is prohibited: While they daily pumped more than two million barrels of black gold from the entire Delta region, three times larger than Switzerland, with more than 5,000 extraction sources and 7,000 kilometres of pipelines, the oil fields in Ogoniland were quiet, the location is too unstable for the consortium.
Every two hundred metres steel platforms were highlighted as extrafacal water sculptures: "Christmas trees" affectionately called the heads of the drillers.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them have total corrosion.
Every instant a head fails, Akpobari says, then he runs a constant oil stream in the water.
According to experts' evaluations, more than two billion litres have been poured into the delta ecosystem over 50 years: year after year, the amount of oil penetrates, as in the wreckage of the ship "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago in the Alaska Sea, one of the greatest ecological catastrophes in human history.
Whoever is responsible for the lasting environmental region will deal with this.
While Shell's consortium and organized oil thefts are responsible for more than 90 percent of pollution, environmentalists see heads about to break up and pipes with leaks like the main causes.
In Nigeria, Shell mainly applies low standards of security normally in the world conventionals, criticised scientist Richard Steiner for the consortium in 2008: Only the indexes of pipeline defects are "about a multiple larger than elsewhere".
In a place, which from far away seems forgotten, there appears a workshop full of oil under the free sky, figures from among the mangroves appear: they are naked and covered with oil.
Among one of the many barrels, which are sometimes attached to drilling, sometimes arbitrarily scattered on the ground, fires a fire: a small illegal refinery.
In the barrel, oil warms up in the fire more hours, explains Michael, the leader of the group.
First, gasoline penetrates through the pipes in the container, later the pipeline of oil drops and eventually comes out diesel.
In this way, Michael and four employees produce daily up to four barrels of diesel of 300 liters: "It brings us 34,000 naira", about $22.
Delta dwellers take advantage of fuel scarcity in one of the largest oil states in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
With the absurd and cheap diesel price of only EUR 40-cent per litre illegal heaters can offer even less: thus reduce the value of their raw material.
It comes from "the bunkers", who called the pipeline network that runs through Ogoniland: According to experts, at this step at least 16 million litres of oil per day are lost throughout the Niger Delta.
Only a small part of the provisional raw material stored is clearly refined illegally: Organized criminal networks, which also belong to politicians and high military positions, keep the best part in algebras and sell it cheaply on the world market.
Activist Akpobari considers the debate to be purely academic about whether the environmental catastrophe is due rather to the management of the population or to the weak mode of production.
"If the oil tankers did not act as invaders and had not completely destroyed the natural habitat of the fish, there would be no sabotage, no theft, no illegal refineries."
While the conditions of the ogoni are destroyed mainly by Shell to the point where only one deduction of the consortium appears: "Perhaps it is better to present another nationality, like China."
Michael's getting nervous.
"It's time you disappeared," says the muscular Ölmann.
"The soldiers can come in any minute."
If the army's special unit takes the illegal refiners, they are not threatened with arresting them, except with a painful bribe.
Soldiers from the north also want, like all Nigerians, to take advantage of raw material.
"This damned invention has completely broken up our country," Akpobari says.
Researchers detect dangerous factory defects in A380 engines
The A380 seems to have a major security problem.
In an investigation of a machine that carried out a forced landing, researchers found a possible factory defect, which can produce "a catastrophic failure in the engine".
The Qantas airline wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
The Qantas Airbus passengers who made an emergency landing in early November were much more fortunate than you can imagine: Australian air security authorities perceived through their investigations a major safety problem in the engines of some A380, and alerted to a possible factory defect.
The potential defect has complicated implications: In a hose connection, cracks can be caused by fatigue or cracks, the ATSB authorities announced in a report published on Thursday.
This could have caused "a catastrophic failure in the engine".
This affected the engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce belonging to 20 aircraft in the A380 series.
Among them was the Qantas-Airbus that had to make a forced landing on November 4 in Singapore.
The Australian airline starts legal media against the British turbine manufacturer.
He filed an application in the federal court in Sidney that allowed further legal action against the company.
Alan Joyce, director of Qantas, stated that his airline will claim compensation for the incident in early November.
In the engine brand they have lost parts and their wing is damaged.
Rolls Royce distinguishes the type of gasoline as the cause of damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines from around the world have to be replaced.
Australian researchers announced that they will carry out more safety tests for super-junks equipped with the engines affected.
The security recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls Royce, said Martin Dolan, spokesperson for ATSB.
The security problem has become important enough to inform everyone concerned.
After the Qantas aircraft's emergency landing, the airline kept its A380 fleet on land for many weeks.
Singapore Airlines maintained approximately three of its eleven A380 temporarily on land.
Lufthansa challenged the engine of an A380 as a precautionary measure.
This double-covered plane is the world's largest passenger plane.
Nevada across the country causes chaos in traffic
Totally white Germany: From one day to another it has snowed in almost the entire country.
In many streets chaos reigns, trains and planes fail.
At least three people have lost their lives in traffic accidents.
Winter Ice Germany: In almost the whole country cold temperatures were reached during Thursday night, which has triggered chaos in traffic at many points.
In some parts of the north and the east, there is a snow layer of 15 cm thick.
Traffic is very limited on most highways and on many streets.
In the A7 at Flensburg height, the quitanieves are in continuous operation, removing the new snow over and over again, but it is not ready.
In addition, strong gusts of wind bar the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The German Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency (BSH) expects live tides with water level 1.2 metres above its usual level on the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holsteins.
In Saxony, snow accumulation caused considerable problems on highways and national roads.
According to Meteomedia weather service, the red alert is called in Sächsischen Schweiz, actually the highest alert.
There is partly 30 cm of freshly fallen snow and cold and strong winds are responsible for reshaping it.
There they were trapped during the night many trucks and cars.
Also in Saxony Anhalt, the police authorities reported major riots in the streets.
In the A2, the snow and the wind stopped traffic and created traffic jams.
In Thuringia the snowshoes affected both A4 and A9.
According to Deutscher Bahn, major disorders are expected in Saxony, Saxony Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
Snow on the road, fallen trees on the roads or broken chain and holes are the main problems.
In Saxony, Leipzig's interurban service is suspended in Nuremberg.
In Saafeld, Thuringia a ICE train had to stop his trip to Munich.
Firefighters and rescue service attended to 165 passengers on the train with wool, food and drink blankets.
Winds with snow sweep the streets.
At the largest German airport, the snowy winds caused numerous suspensions of flights.
According to a spokesperson from the flight information center, in Munich some cancellations have already been announced.
In Frankfurt am Main, according to a spokesperson from Fraport there are already 40 flights cancelled.
The quitanieves are in continuous operation.
However, there are few passengers at the airport, despite that there are 400 country beds prepared for them.
On many streets, on Wednesday afternoon there were many accidents.
In the afternoon a trucker died in a collision with a train on a track crossing in Ostholstein.
The machinist suffered slight injuries.
In the vicinity of Nuremberg there was a similar accident due to the snowy streets: Also here a truck was reached on a track crossing because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver lost his life.
On the train four passengers were injured, the journey from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was blocked for this reason in the morning.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after taking a ride with her car near Aschaffenburg on a slippery road.
Weather experts have good news: The snow will become more and more soft and dusty and will therefore be rewound in soft cracks.
But the wind will decrease.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by strong and rapid winds.
No doubt it will continue to be very cold, in some places up to 15 degrees negative.
Deuxche Bank is looking for a buyer for his twin towers
The Deutsche Bank wants to separate itself from its symbol: According to one article, the financial institution seeks buyer for its office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
The property could provide up to EUR 500 million.
Deutschen Bank recently arranged its headquarters: Twin towers were modernized in the Frankfurt banking district; while bankers returned to their old workplace.
But now the financial consortium seems to want to take advantage of the costs of renewal, and look for a buyer for both skyscrapers, as the Financial Times Deutschland says based on a spokesperson.
The spokesperson does not name the reasons for the sale in project.
"We always check whether property should be owned or sold and then rent it again," he said.
That is why Germany's largest credit institution once again renounces its company's headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank acquired the twin towers in mid-2007 for EUR 272 million from the investor of a house fund and then made the relevant arrangements.
Energy reforms reached figures of approximately EUR 200 million.
A sale would make a lot of money for the bank.
Experts in this area calculate the value of the towers of the newspaper known as "Greenwers" in around 500 million euros.
If refurbished buildings are sold on a bank fund or to an independent investor has not been disclosed at present, the spokesman said.
Thousands of people mourning the dead miners
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people thought of buried miners, who died after many explosions in a mine.
However, the bodies could not be found because security measures remain precarious in the place of misfortune.
Almost two weeks ago an intense explosion took place in the Pike River mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were buried in the mine.
A probe was introduced in the place of misfortune, but did not discover any sign of survival.
Due to high concentration of toxic gases and successive explosions, no rescue equipment was able to drop for safety reasons.
After the second intense detonation, the authorities and experts concluded that there was no chance that the miners would have survived.
The bodies could not be recovered to date.
Family members and friends now remember those who died with a memorial act.
Ten thousand people have changed with the shining brightness of the sun in Greymouth on the New Zealand island of the South.
They keep quiet for two minutes.
In honor of the buried miners, 29 tables were placed with the helmets, lamps and names of the miners.
There were also photographs and personal objects, under clothes and surfboards.
The flags waved half a pole in front of the country's government buildings.
New Zealand hoped the miners would return to the surface "of the depths of the earth," said John Key, the president of the New Zealand government, to the participants of the memorial act.
"But they never came home."
He cannot assume the death of his son until he has seen his body, says Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the mine.
Along with the president of the government and the family members of the victims participated in the memorial act many foreign diplomats.
In the first explosion on 19 November, British and South African miners were also buried.
Rescue workers began to extinguish a fire inside the coal mine on the island of southern New Zealand.
As soon as explosive gases have been extracted, the abrasive temperatures inside the mine will begin to descend, said Gary Knowles, the police chief, to the journalists.
Fuck you, warrior!
Does the gore fit in the artistic cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn again explores the boundaries of gender with his epic battle "Walhalla Rising".
What audience did Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think of when he shot "Walhalla Rising"?
A Viking warrior imprisoned with one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) gets rid of his torturers and kills his enemies with almost superhuman struggles, sounds ideal for young spectators who seek bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to use brutal methods to kill and tear out their enemies the guts of their bodies alive when he is in a bad mood.
On the other hand, Unojo, as he actually calls himself, does not say almost any word throughout the film and the other characters let themselves be carried by at least one or two sentences or a couple of painful mortal screams.
Otherwise they are quiet and enjoy the beautiful and terrifying mountain landscapes of Scotland, which the background offers to the Viking world of approximately a thousand years ago.
Rather ideal for grown filmmakers interested in existentialism and very calm camera movements.
When a film has several target groups it is a penalty that cannot be ruled out mutually.
Director Winding Refn views his wildlings and trilogy on the hairy drug dealer "Pusher" as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but he refuses stoically to make his works for all audiences with something more humor in the main current or something less brutality of the artistic home.
A brain mass and guts that spring up cannot deter most artistic film followers.
Most of the fans of the action die of boredom, if Unojo takes a boat to Jerusalem with a troop of violent Christian missionaries for interpretable reasons and an eternity in calm and fog remains stuck before his team arrives in America and shuts up again there.
It is a pity that "Walhalla Rising" has not found a film distributor in Germany and is only published on DVD.
It is a disaster against the magnificent images, but also because, after the presumptive and bloody facade, a piece of cinema is hidden sometimes exciting, which deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogues or logical action, everything is atmosphere, a febrile dream transformed into a film.
And that's why there's no escape for the spectators.
Refn is judged only a moment of relaxation and its glaciary images and the lubrous soundtrack of trance make him a knot in his throat, especially the incredible hate, which from the hearts of the characters goes towards him.
Only a young blonde, who loyally supports Unojo, retains something as innocence, all the others are possessed by anger.
Above all, the hero of a single eye, whose motives are never explained, becomes at any time a warrior out of hell for enemies and provisional allies, possibly in the ambassador of the same devil.
He represents the loss, but perhaps only for those who are lost anyway.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that you can hate and admire, to be angry, alter and surprised.
An experience.
Mysterious earth movements
The IAEA nuclear energy organization has new indications of a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
The country refuses to take an opinion on this subject until controls are permitted.
On the average night from 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four F-15 I Israeli combat aircraft attacked a mysterious cubic building in Syria.
It is located on the banks of Euphrates; the larger and nearest city, 30 kilometers away is Dair as-Saur.
Its name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), it deals with a reactor that the Syrians apparently built with the help of North Korea in the cube, hidden in a valley coming out of the river.
According to information from the CIA International Intelligence Service at the end of April 2008, a current reactor is designed under the name of the nearby Kibar very suitable for plutonium production, with which nuclear weapons are built.
On the other hand, the technique serves only for purposes other than those of the 1950s.
The CIA showed a video presentation with blurred satellite images.
They showed with a computer animation where the reactor components were before destruction, which was a small copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
They also taught photographs that showed the building from nearby or from within.
The reactor had been in operation for a short time, he said, but it was not yet equipped with fuel bars.
Today, three years after the bombing, it is hardly better known than at that time, the puzzles grew bigger over time.
The former president of the United States, George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that before the attack the CIA was absolutely sure that the Syrians had built a reactor in the Kibar, but that he had hardly seen any evidence that there was "a nuclear weapons program in the country".
In Europe, several secret service agents prefer to be even more cautious and only speak of a "supposed reactor", although they consider the CIA's presentation "applausible".
They lack solid evidence, as well as IAEA.
When he was asked what assurance it was to have in front of a reactor, a senior UN diplomat answered in the summer in a stoning manner that the IAEA has "sufficient material to have questions."
The Syrians quickly disposed of the debris of the alleged "unusual military building" and raided the ground consciously.
However, in June 2008, an IAEA team under the command of former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found uranium tracers in the Kibar, which had been manufactured by people.
In addition, the IAEA obtained satellite images on a Member State, from commercial sellers right after the attack, which must have a higher information value than the CIA presented.
However, these photographs did not reach the market because an unknown customer, perhaps Israel, bought them exclusively.
That is why the IAEA cannot verify its authenticity independently.
Syria has always implied that it has never had a secret nuclear program or built any reactors.
The uranium came from Israeli weapons, Damaskus explained.
The IAEA rejected it as inverse after the particle analysis.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss it, just as with satellite images.
In addition, the controllers are banned from a second inspection in the-Kibar and entry into the ruins of the bombed building.
Israel also keeps a strict silence.
"We will never comment," Ehud Olmert, Prime Minister in office at the time of the attack, recently confirmed the official position.
Thus, the investigation of the case has not been successful since June 2008 and "has gradually turned into a serious credibility problem for the authorities", as a senior Western diplomat corresponds to a place in the IAEA in Vienna, a serious infringement of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Atomic Weapons is finally pending, which oversees the IAEA.
The IAEA considers three more teams as the key to progress in the clarification, which must be "on functional connection" with the alleged reactor, and others such as these still exist.
The inspectors have not publicly disclosed until what equipment they are dealing with, nor what functions they have, nor if they seem suspicious.
According to the newspaper Süddeutschen Zeitung, the IAEA has designated Marj as an internal entity as a Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, again derived from the proximity of the towns.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these places and located a complex of buildings near Masyaf with satellite images, which is very likely to be one of the suspicious objects.
Possibly located on or immediately next to a military base, Syria therefore prohibits the entry of all three places into the IAEA.
In Vienna, it is said that Syrians fear a record that the United States has requested IAEA to spy on military plants.
Nuclear detectives were alerted to teams thanks to warnings from the US secret service.
Through satellite photographs, IAEA has indications that material is moved between the three locations and the cube to the Euphrates shore.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the teams can be "related to fuel production".
But there is “no indication of sensitive activities”, no enrichment of uranium or reconditioning; processes that are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor shall be operated with uranium which is not enriched.
Where uranium should come from and where plutonium should subsequently be separated for bombs, for these central questions there are, at best, plausible assumptions.
There is also no doubt as to whether the ruins, the valuable tracks that can be recovered, are in all three places.
As the hundreds of loads of ground trucks disappeared, no one has information about where the debris remains.
The OIAE considers it unlikely the al-Tibni salt mine, located within a few kilometres from El-Kibar to the other side of the Euphrates, which the Syrians recognized in 1998 for its ability as an area for radioactive waste.
Recently, Robert Kelly, the former IAEA inspector, associated her with the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the prestigious magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
But the photographs from the orbit show that the Syrians made land movements in the three suspected suspicious places and eliminated large containers after IAEA requested entry.
It may be chance but it just helps to dispel suspicion.
Furthermore, in the diplomatic sector, it is said that the IAEA has spent a few months developing an inspection plan there, which the Syrians would allow, to maintain the possible military secrecy, only the deployment shows the magnitude of the inspectors' interest.
Meanwhile, Damascus also criticizes this proposal.
The Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago reassured themselves that the reactor was already destroyed, so the matter has not been very urgent, for a couple of months now, Glyn Davies, a type of US ambassador, scolding the so-called exceptional inspections, one of the most rigorous means the Venetian nuclear authorities have to establish controls.
Yukiya Amano, the director of the IAEA, who must propose these inspections, has spoken of "an option to which I am open in the future", but still hesitates.
This path is very risky: To do so, most of the IAEA's governing board is needed, and some of the 35 countries represented there are not exactly anxious for an escalation.
On the other hand, as one diplomat reflected, "And what if they don't find anything?"
Love in the Time of War
There are problems since Angelina Jolie started in summer with the direction of her debut still unnamed.
She herself wrote the script, a story of love between a Bosnian and a Serb.
Much is not known about this, but this is enough for agitation.
Rumor is very persistent, the Muslim woman fell in love with her Serbian rapist during the Yugoslavia war.
Bosnian women's associations have protested quickly, and at the last moment they moved several days of shooting planned in Sarajevo to Hungary.
The film has been filmed in Hungary and post-production, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the women's organization of war victims wrote to the UN High Commissioner, UNHCR, by Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, reported to a Bosnian newspaper, Jolie is the ambassador to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
She's not a diplomat, women offered her a meeting in Hungary weeks ago that she rejected.
The meeting took place in Bosnia, Hasecic says.
There are no love stories in the rape camps, and Jolie's position on this is enough to inform the victims about the script.
His organization, in accordance with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, has recommended the removal of Jolie as ambassador, informs the Guardian.
But what exactly did Jolie write for the scenes?
The ministry of Bosnian culture that read the script, gave behind a strip and loosened a recording permit in Sarajevo, is not entirely clear why Jolie was not at all.
The young author reiterates that she does not pursue political purposes with her film, is actively introduced into the Yugoslav conflict, wants to show the horrible consequences of the war and to give voice to all the parties involved.
Its contents are still inaccurate.
In the network a second synopsis of the film that sounds quite different: The lovers were together before the beginning of the war and meet again when she, a Muslim Bosnia, is deported to a Serbian field in which he works as a guard.
What sounds considerably different is the variant "victim of rape falls in love with torturer".
It is certain that Jolie's film really starts before the war.
The pressure on her, Jolie says, is "unjust and based on misinformation".
They can now achieve peace with Hollywood hackers: While the script remains on the network illegally, as many others have before.
Nothing like away from here
This afternoon at last it's good again for the Irish.
No Trace of Distress
On the other hand, the home team dominates its customers from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans shout with joy as they resound high music, beat the ground with their feet.
The Bailey club vibrates in South Irish Cork, because the players launch, and find, pingpong balls to the beer glasses from a distance of three meters
The strange show is called "Beerpong", and the prize for the winner is 500 euros plus plane tickets to Las Vegas for the world beerpong championship in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy, this out-of-the-art drinking game and computer discreet really don't make good migas.
And the 26-year-old tries to have fun with that, to be distracted by the fulminant question, what will come to him in the future.
The fun in Las Vegas is not in your plans, in January you will conduct a personal interview in New Zealand.
"I have a bad feeling," he says.
"It's a long way from home and I haven't got a job there yet."
At least: His girlfriend is waiting for him in Auckland, "of one shot he got the job of his dreams as event manager, perhaps a good sign," says the young man and smile.
Because of the bad prospects at home, two of Tanners' three brothers have already sought luck abroad.
Her sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sidney, her brother Colin currently works as a IT advisor in London.
Young people leave: There are many families on the island like the Tanners.
100,000 Irish will leave the country in the near future, predicting economic experts and the ESRI social research institute in Dublin.
Up to 2015 there are 200,000 emigrants.
A great loss for this small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants.
The forecasts are confirmed, it is a migratory wave comparable to that suffered by the island in the 1980s.
After a decade of progression that brought great well-being to the Irish, melancholy is now spreading.
The economic crisis is especially confusing for well-formed Irish young people, for whom so far everything is up.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in boom years.
Everyone needs money in abundance.
But three out of ten men and women under thirty are unemployed.
In the Irish Times there are letters to the mass director of young emigrants who complain that: "In Ireland everything goes down."
"There should be a uprising against politicians and bankers, but who can, goes and loses our country and with it to an entire generation."
"The last one to close the door."
Leanne Caulfield, law student and president of the union of Irish students sees a dark future as the government only devotes itself to assemblies and no longer offers prospects for the future to young people.
"They reduce minimum wages, but have no strategies to achieve new jobs," says the 20-year-old girl.
Notice how your peers range from unrecognized practices to the following.
His greatest concern, he explains, is to have to emigrate in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
People like Stephen McLarnon are trying to see this topic positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a fair that offers a service around the topic of working abroad.
"For those who begin to work, doing it abroad is an excellent opportunity, the first steps to lead your career," says the manager.
On their website are photos of a boy practicing surfing in Australia and another practicing snowboarding in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not like doing it in galleries, but it brings freedom and fun.
For the past half year, Sean O'Donovan has known what it's like to build something elsewhere.
Since there was nothing to be done for the 29-year-old engineer, he is currently working with 15 Irish colleagues in construction in Germany.
Now they're building a fashion store in Gelsenkirchen.
In January we go to Hannover or Berlin, to the next project.
O'Donovan sees his homeland only a few times because he works overtime so he can pay a credit for his home in Ireland.
"The situation is a bit crazy," he says, as long ago he stepped the threshold of his home.
"I earn money in Germany for a house in Ireland, where I'm never so good."
He laughs a little embarrassed and goes through frozen rooms.
The small house is in an elegant residential area with careful gardens in front of the houses, at the entrance are parking large and expensive cars.
O'Donovan bought the house along with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros, 100 per cent financed by credit.
"It was crazy times, there was easy money without many questions," he says.
Are you afraid to fail with credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, serves more hot tea and says, "I don't have kids to feed and I'm young; if everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch."
The civil engineer does not like the complaints he often hears at present.
"No one should go hungry, our situation is not, with much difference, as dramatic as in past times here on the island," he says.
"Working a season abroad is not the worst thing that can happen, maybe we feel like Irish for the first time."
He laughed and realized about his father, who had gone to England in the last great economic crisis.
"After seven years he returned and life continued in Ireland, very simple."
Cian Tanner likes these ideas.
Leave the future pending and simply see what life is like elsewhere.
He worked for a couple of years in London, and why wouldn't he and his girlfriend go well in New Zealand?
But in these days there is one thing that worries you of the greatest: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
I'm afraid I can degenerate into a farewell party.
"Only not too many emotions," he says and gives a great drink to his beer.
"Goodbye, it sounds very distressing."
"We better call it a party to go, very relaxed, with a couple of friends, a couple of drinks, a couple of games."
Democratic routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as well as support for private companies.
Crime generates greater concern than unemployment.
In addition, in much of the region, Brazil is seen as a more influential country than the United States.
These are some of the findings of the latest Latinobarometer survey conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
As the survey has been conducted regularly since 1995, it allows for monitoring of changes in attitudes in the region.
The results of this year's survey in September and early October highlight two related issues.
The first is the relatively animated mood prevailing in Latin America.
The second is the increasing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased considerably in several countries on the Pacific coast of South America (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has reached an average of 6 per cent annually since 2002, support for democracy has increased from 40 per cent in 2005 to 61 per cent this year.
He also grew up in Mexico, where the economy recovered after a major decline in production last year.
However, only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the area, are convinced democrats, which lowers the regional average (see figure 2).
About 44 per cent of respondents in the region were satisfied with the way democracy operates in practice in their country, the same figure as last year, but considerably higher than 25 per cent registered in 2001 (Graph 3).
About 34 per cent said they trusted the Congress of their country and 45 per cent in their Government, the same amount as last year in both cases, but considerably higher than in 2003 (17 per cent and 24 per cent, respectively).
A decade ago, economic turmoil in Latin America seriously affected support for democracy.
The fact that it was maintained during the global financial crisis was probably due to the fact that many Latin American countries were only affected by a short recession and enjoyed strong recovery.
Moreover, the existence of a stronger social security network has helped to protect the poorest.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty only marginally increased in 2009 and that it has been reduced again this year, up to 32 per cent.)
However, the mood varies considerably from country to country (see figure 4).
The good economic performance of Brazil and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is reflected in a general sense of progress.
This feeling is less common in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more severe and violent crimes have increased.
For the second time since polls began, more polled in Latin America mention crime, rather than unemployment, as the most serious problem your country faces (see figure 5).
About 31 per cent states that, whether they or a close relative, they have been victims of crime in the past year, a figure that has been reduced since 38 per cent of last year and is the lowest percentage since 1995.
The most positive economic returns are reflected in increased support for private enterprises and the market economy: around 71 per cent of respondents in the region claim that private enterprises are essential for development, while in 2007 it was only 56 per cent (see Chart 6).
Around 58 per cent agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow your country to develop, compared to 47 per cent last year.
It is interesting that 62% of respondents in Venezuela share the same view (and 80% supports private companies), although its left-wing president, Hugo Chávez, is expropriating many private companies.
Brazil is the country with greater leadership in the region, as indicated by 19 per cent of respondents (compared to 18 per cent last year), followed by the United States (9 per cent, same figure as last year) and Venezuela (9 per cent versus 11 per cent a year ago).
However, the United States is considered most influential by respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, while Venezuela holds such a title in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Elections to garbage
No one hoped that the general elections held in Haiti on 28 November would be perfect.
However, they went far worse than the foreigners feared who tried to help the country recover from its problems.
Votes were introduced in the polls, some people voted several times, ballots taken in the canisters, electoral schools destroyed and acts of intimidation.
Electoral schools opened with hours of delay.
Many Haitians, including groups displaced by the January earthquake, roamed the area trying to find out where they had to vote.
Some of them eventually gave themselves up for defeat.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several of the most popular, denounced fraud and called for the annulment of the elections.
Protests, some of them violent, spread throughout the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the highest-ranking United Nations official in Haiti, stated that they were "a relatively good election in many ways."
The observers for the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community stated with caution that "we do not believe that these irregularities, however serious they may be, necessarily invalidate the process".
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, which according to its opponents is committed to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president, and to his candidate, Jude Célestin, should announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The disaggregation is expected to take place in January.
Not all hopes regarding elections have yet been lost.
The two main opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rapper, and Mirlande Manigat, a former lady, have withdrawn their initial request requesting the invalidation of the vote.
But problems can still arise if the electoral authority declares that Mr Celestin, who has little support, if he has any, has gone to the second round.
Considering that the cholera epidemic is devastating the country and more than one million earthquake survivors are still living in stores, a great abstention is expected.
At the moment, many Haitians wanted to vote, but failed to do so because of a lack of organization.
About 250,000 identity papers, necessary for voting, had not yet been distributed shortly before the elections.
There's a lot at stake.
Aid donors consider that the choice of a popular and legitimate government is an essential step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And, as has been evident, Haitians themselves think so too.
Moving from points to center
In the weeks that have passed since losing her husband, Cristina Fernández, the president of Argentina, has enjoyed a great sympathy among the public that has increased its popularity by 20 points, to more than 50%, the highest level that she has recorded since her election in 2007.
Nevertheless, which may turn it into a successful campaign for a second term in the next year's elections will depend on whether the clearly affected Mrs Fernández puts aside the intransigence of her late husband, her predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
At this point, the indications are not conclusive.
Mr Kirchner, who continued to take care of economic policy even after his wife succeeded him as president, was used to drawing up budgets which were undervalued by tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential marriage to spend additional income at its discretion.
In theory, Mrs Fernández's government lost its majority in Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided, a situation that has worsened after Kirchner's death due to a heart attack on 27 October.
Some dissenting members of the peronist movement in power have faced Mrs Fernández.
However, after some chaotic sessions in which a deputy punched the other in the face and other deputies accused the government of bribery, Congress decided to reject the 2011 budget.
"I won't argue," said the president.
The 2010 budget will therefore apply next year, which will provide the President with an even greater margin of action when spending it.
The economy is improving considerably: it is likely to grow to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently 11.1%, but many private calculations, in addition to the union's wage requirements, place it at about 30 per cent.
Mr. Kirchner, who took power in 2003 when Argentina was on the brink of economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction their priorities, rather than inflation control.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, pressed the private sector and had the INDEC, the Institute of Statistics, adapt the official inflation statistics.
Will President Fernández now modernize these policies?
It has convened meetings between the private sector and union leaders.
In addition, its officials claim that they want to limit wage increases next year to 18 per cent.
The economy has been driven by the high prices of Argentine agricultural exports worldwide.
However, inflation has limited the momentum to growth achieved with a major devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps that is why Mrs Fernández is giving signs of wanting to restore Argentina's financial links with the rest of the world.
At the beginning of the year, the government reached an agreement with the bondholders who had refused to reschedule prior to the debt that Argentina had not paid in 2001.
At present, it seems that Mrs Fernández is about to conclude an agreement with the creditor governments grouped into the Paris Club, to which she owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners always insisted that this would not involve IMF supervision, as is usually the case.
However, last month Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economics, announced that the Fund will offer "technical assistance" to develop a new index of prices for national consumption, which seems to prelude to the cleanliness of INDEC.
It is not clear whether President Fernández wants to continue in politics when she finishes her term of office, bearing in mind that she no longer has her husband at her side.
If he does, he will need to gain the support of the middle class, much of which has been tired of kirchnerism.
When the Argentines return from their summer holidays in March, the wave of sympathy for her has fallen.
If you want to win other elections, you will have to decide whether or not you reject, calmly, many of your husband’s policies.
Mid-Hour by China
Taiwan voters are slowly approaching a kind of closer union with the continent.
What do Taiwan think about her big brother across the narrow?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70 per cent of the eligible, came on 27 November to elect mayors and councillors from five urban districts in what seems to be a broad assessment of the president, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr Ma himself has become a champion of the feelings on the continent, building innovative business links, including a partial free trade pact, the biggest change in relations with China since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but little by little.
Although his Kuomintang (KMT) party ended up winning three of the five mayoral elections, he failed to get the majority of the votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (PPD), which has tended for total independence from Taiwan, obtained almost 50% of all votes against 45% of the KMT.
If they were the presidents, Mr Ma would be in trouble.
Since his election two years ago, the proportion of votes of his party has decreased by about 8%.
For the first time, the PPD tied with the KMT in the municipalities.
In the elections, typical elements of the Taiwanese elections were seen, including noisy campaign trucks and large crowds with bandits and light girls dancing clothes.
Nor did the mysterious attempt to murder rigor.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, Honorary Chairman of the KMT, was campaigning for one of the KMT candidates the night before the election.
A man of the crowd shot the young man directly in the face, wounding him and killing a passerby.
The curious thing is that it has not been possible to determine whether the man intended to harm Lien or to avenge himself of the candidate.
In any case, says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PPD, the shooting affected the elections, sowing suspicions about the PPD and causing voters to lean over the KMT.
Maybe the only great winner of the campaign was China.
It was surprising that it was not the matter of the continent itself.
Instead, the candidates spoke of public housing plans and job creation.
Taiwan normally enjoys its de facto independence and hates the military threat of China.
Therefore, KMT often avoids advertising its links with the government in Beijing.
But this time too the PPD avoided encouraging the feeling against China.
It responds to the new awareness that Chinese trade is essential for Taiwan's economic survival.
For his part, Mr Ma stated that his policy with regard to China had been confirmed to be acceptable to most Taiwanese.
It is expected that the Government of Beijing will continue to bribe them with trade, in accordance with its strategy to ensure that Taiwan returns to the reins.
China did not waste time sending a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
He would certainly also like to achieve political integration, but the first is first.
The best thing is to wait for the 2012 presidential elections to be held.
In any case, the PPD has been reinvented.
Two years ago he was in a bad situation: his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was imprisoned accused of corruption.
The President from 2000 to 2008 openly urged explicit independence.
However, under the leadership of Mrs Tsai, a new generation of moderates has emerged and the PPD is striving to attract professionals and young people.
Mrs Tsai has been warmly welcomed as a candidate of the PPD for the presidency, as did Her Tseng-chang, who served under Chen.
Now his party is doing everything possible to show that he can also have relations with Beijing.
Mrs Tsai announced plans for the creation of an expert group acting as a contact point between the PPD and China, provided negotiations can be carried out without preconditions.
Mrs Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party represents a "trustworthy alternative" to Mr Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems furious about the change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he stated that PPD candidates would have been better off if they had insisted that Taiwan was an independent country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatic one, not to introduce himself to the Presidents.
Even without Mr Chen interceding, the PPD will have difficulty choosing among its potential candidates.
The KMT must also carry out a conscientious examination.
Mr Ma's assessments have been poor despite the impressive economic growth; the KMT candidates have not wanted to campaign with him.
Their lack of popularity seems to be mainly due to unemployment and the growing differences between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesperson claims that he will restructure his office as well as local teams.
The large PPD samples suggest that Taiwan's support for an approach is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese consider economic integration with China inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a well-known columnist, "the point of no return has already crossed."
Appointments to the Grammy: the jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is the surprise choice in the category of Artist revelation.
Act at the request of a president and possibly people will look at you.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old bassist and jazz singer personally selected by President Obama to act at his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, was one of the surprises of the Grammys this year with a high-level nomination in the category of Best Artist Revelation.
Considering that Spalding has been a acclaimed jazz figure since his 2008 album, "Esperanza", the nomination gives what to think, but respects the rules of the Grammys according to which he must be an artist who has not taken out more than three albums before recording that "determines the public identity of that artist".
His ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", undoubtedly made a great advance and, taking into account his light and pleasant vocal style, as well as a great skill with pop influences, funk and Latin rhythms, one can at least draw a distinction between Spalding and the way towards the success of Norah Jones in 2003, the closest equivalent for the Grammy voters, who have recently focused on the field of jazz for this category.
In the other categories, the Grammy voters honored Vijay Iyer Trio's "History", an exciting and magnificent record that was one of the favorites last year.
Among Iyer's competitors is veteran saxophonist James Moody with "Moody 4B" and teclist John Beasley for "Positoothly."
Trombone Shorty, a favorite rock star in New Orleans and usual guest in HBO's "Treme", was honored in the contemporary jazz category, which nevertheless leans considerably towards fusion as in Stanley Clarke's albums, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The wild punk of Darcy James Argue's Secret Society gained a deserved recognition in the category of great groups, competing against the great camera jazz of Billy Childs Ensemble and the ever risky Dave Holland, whose live album with his octet, "Pathways", was a great example of the Bajist's democratic leadership in his band.
Grammy Awards nominations: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey in the best direction of classic albums
Appointments in the field of classical music for the 53rd Grammy Awards include a mix of musicians and composers from around the world.
The main nominations were for Michael Daugherty by "God Ex Machina", by piano and orchestra, of five movements, and Steve Mackey with "Dreamhouse", a work for three-movement eclectic orchestra.
Among the nominees with links to southern California are the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his symphony No 4, "Los Angeles", a piece commissioned by the Philharmonic of Los Angeles and premiered at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The composer based on Los Angeles Avner Dorman is also nominated by his Mandolin Concerto.
Classical music nominations are distributed in thirteen categories covering orchestra, opera, coral and solo albums.
The classical producer category of the year includes five nominees: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin, and James Mallinson.
The names for the classical music album are Bruckner by the Symphony No. 3 and No. 4 of the Orchestra Royal Concertgebouw; Daugherty by "God Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey by "Dreamhouse" by the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificum - the Art of the Castrati" by several artists; and the "Requiem" by Verdi of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the opera category, the candidates are Berg by "Lulu" of the Royal Opera House orchestra; Adolf Hasse by "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho by "L'Amour de Loin" by Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin by "The Enchanted Wanderer" by the Mariinsky Theatre orchestra and choir; and Arthur Sullivan by "Ivanhoe" by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
The composers nominated for a Grammy by contemporary compositions include Pärt by Symphony No. 4, Daugherty by "God Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze by "Appassionato Plus", Magnus Lindberg by "Graffiti" and Shchedrin by "The Enchanted Wanderer".
Pärt's No. 4 Symphony premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 at a session recorded by the Philharmonic of Los Angeles, led by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The piece, approximately 30 minutes, is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concert" is nominated by instrumental solo performance with orchestra.
The composer of Los Angeles wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for her to play in Avi Avi Avital, who played the concert with the Metropolis Ensemble, based in New York.
"It was composed with sounds from the Middle East and numerous scales and rhythms from North Africa," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Director Pierre Boulez, 85, was nominated in the orchestra function category for the Chicago Symphony Orchestra during a recording of Stravinsky works.
Among the named instrumental soloists are pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
The nominees as vocal soloists are all women this year: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic mixing category, the soprano Jessye Norman was named by his recording of "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The mosque proposed in Temecula obtains the approval of the commission of order
The Temacula Mosque project has obtained the unanimous support of the local ordering commission after more than five hours of public testimony, often heated.
Critics attacked the project by saying it promotes terrorism and blockades.
However, committee members decided on Wednesday night that the new religious centre respected local legislation and would be impressive from an aesthetic point of view.
"Many good people came to show their support, both Christian and Jewish or Baha'i, of all religions," said Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic center of the Temacula Valley, on Thursday morning.
"The truth is, as an American citizen, it makes me proud."
"Shows that justice prevails."
"The opposition is really minimal," he adds.
"Only they speak very loud."
"In this valley there are wonderful people."
The meeting began at 6:00 p.m. and lasted practically until midnight; most of the time people were dedicated to interceding for or against the center, virtually the same amount on each side, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The discussion continued on the newspaper's website.
"The United States no longer exists", is read in one of the comments.
"This is another Planet of the apes with Mrs. Freedom killed in the sand."
"America has fallen."
The plans for the construction of Islamic centres have also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including near the zero zone, the New York area where the attacks of 11 September 2011 occurred.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmush has denounced acts of violence.
Her congregation of about 135 families has lived smoothly in Riverside County for years, but she wanted a bigger and better space than the warehouse that rented on a shared property with a water filtration system manufacturer.
The new mosque of 24,943 square feet, with a Mediterranean architectural style, would include two minarets and rise to 43 feet.
It would occupy an area of 4.32 acres on Nicolas Road, about two miles east of Chaparral Institute.
Opponents can still resort to the project before the Municipal Council.
A arsenic-resistant microbe raises the possibility of new forms of life on Earth... or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacteria that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients expands the possibility of finding new forms of life on Earth and possibly on other planets.
Although researchers discovered the curious bacteria here on Earth, they say it proves that there may be life forms without the main elements they considered essential.
"This organism has a double capacity."
"It can grow either with phosphorus or with arsenic."
"That makes it something very peculiar, although little is missing to be a really 'alien' type of life," said Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report appearing in the online edition of the Science publication on Thursday.
For a long time, there have been six major elements essential to life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
However, researchers have discovered that bacteria, found in Mono Lake, California, can continue to grow after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
"It makes you wonder what else is possible," said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
According to Anbar, the finding is important for the search for life on different planets on Earth, since researchers need to be able to recognize life, to know what it looks like.
The study focuses on a microbe discovered on Earth.
However, the convening of a press conference to discuss it, in which details of the discovery were not disclosed, generated a great speculation on the Internet on the possibility that the report would indicate the discovery of alien life.
He didn't.
What the discovery "shows is that in other planetary environments, there could be organisms that use other elements to boost their biochemistry and that the set of "standard" elements that we consider indispensable for life may not be so fixed," said Charles Cockell, Professor of the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, in Milton Keynes, UK.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is novel because it demonstrates the replacement of one element by another in biochemistry and basic biochemical structure," Cockell added.
The discovery was not made by chance.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's Astrobiology Institute, who conducted the study, focused on Mono Lake because it has high arsenic levels.
Arsenic and phosphorus are similar from a chemical point of view, so he speculated that a microbe exposed to both could replace one another.
"Arsenic is toxic primarily because its chemical behavior is similar to phosphorus."
"Therefore, it may be difficult for organisms to differentiate them."
"However, arsenic is different enough that it doesn't work as well as phosphorus, so it enters and, in some way, calls biochemical machinery," Anbar explains.
The researchers collected the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed them to increasing concentrations of arsenic, to which they managed to adapt and use to grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus, but the fact that it can live with arsenic in its place raises the possibility that there may naturally be a form of life that uses arsenic, whether in other areas of the Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an Assistant Professor of Microbiology at the University of Florida, indicated that the idea that arsenic can be replaced by phosphorus is not new, but an example had never been found to prove it works.
Arsenic was most common in the early ages of the Earth, he noted, so researchers speculated that the first forms of life may have used it.
"Yes, he suggests that there could be other means of generating life, not just the way life was formed on Earth in the past," said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Health Institutes.
The missing stolen dogs have been found in Compton
The two missing dogs were found in front of the Bellflower motel, according to the officers of the sheriff of Los Angeles County on Thursday.
The four competition dogs, two Akitas and two Welsh Corgi Pembroke, disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express truck in which they were spending the night in front of the Bellflower Motel 6, as reported by the authorities.
Two of the canines recovered on Wednesday afternoon and the remaining two were found on Wednesday evening, as reported by Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is that dogs are all right," Whitmore said.
"They're in good condition."
"They have returned with their rightful owners."
Whitmore did not want to indicate exactly where the dogs were found, what neighborhood, or the circumstances of the discovery.
"An investigation is being carried out."
"We don't mean anything," Whitmore said.
"We're following a few clues."
The owners of the dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be found, so they made some comment on Thursday.
They met with their two Akitas in a county animal shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
Sheriff's assistants found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
According to the authorities, the Akitas (Trace, a 3-year-old dog, and Didi, a 10-month-old bitch) had not been harmed.
But Bunny and Peter, the Corgis that Rickard and Peek intended to exhibit in the competitions of the area this week on behalf of the Japanese owners of dogs, remained missing until Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in the city for the AKC/Eukanuba national championship in Long Beach this weekend and intended to show Trace.
The other dogs were going to exhibit them in other competitions planned for the days prior to the AKC/Eukanuba championship, according to Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops on the tour of almost two months that the couple takes part in canine competitions.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked-in at the motel.
Normally they stay in motels and park the van right in front of the window of your room.
They took three other dogs (a boxer breed, a terrier Parson Russell and a Brittany, who slept with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and Corgis in the van because they had a very thick coat and would be cooler.
They left the windows slightly open so the dogs could breathe fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the robbery of the van on Tuesday at six in the morning.
Peek had said they would offer a reward to anyone who could drive them to the Corgis, equipped with microchips to identify them.
Thursday was unclear whether a reward would be given or not.
The lion is ready to roar again, while the restructuring of MGM gets the final approval of the court
After 18 months of confusion and uncertainty, MGM has finally obtained green light to start again.
On Thursday, a federal bankruptcy judge in New York officially approved the "pre-armed" plan by creditors to eliminate approximately $5 billion in debt, pave the way for the 86-year entertainment company to focus its efforts on the production and premiere of films and television programmes.
The Thursday ruling confirms that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, so there are no other legal obstacles for MGM to relaunch under the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the main executives of what will be a reduced study.
Staff will be reduced from 400 to approximately 320 members.
In fact, MGM will not leave Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase closes a $500 million planned credit instrument to finance the operations and productions of the new MGM.
The investment bank is currently syndicating the credit, which on its own is contributing $75 million, and is expected to be financed by mid-December.
The restructuring process of the study began in May 2009, when the investment bank Moelis and Co. was hired to advise on the management necessary to order their finances while struggling to make interest payments for $300 million a year.
In August, Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former President of Enron and an expert in bankruptcy recovery, known for his work in Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to solve MGM's financial tribulations and satisfy the more than 140 studio creditors required much more time than expected.
After several months of discussions, in late 2009, the parties agreed to put the company for sale.
However, the auction attracted a few owners and none of them were willing to pay the more than $2 billion that creditors were looking for.
Before the spring of this year, he returned to the design table while the MGM team began working on a restructuring plan that, after months of discussion and internal disagreements, was finally supported by creditors in late October.
When MGM officially leaves bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper companies will receive multi-million-dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis and Co., who has already received $1.2 million, will get a $9.5 million payment.
Cooper companies, which have been collecting $375,000 per month for their company administration services, will receive "success fees" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production in MGM, which premiered only one film this year, and gathered an annual board of seven or eight films that will be released in 2012.
They also plan to co-finance two films based on "El Hobbit", along with Warner Bros.
The study needs to conclude a separate loan of between $265 million and $275 million to finance its share of those two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns approximately 18% of MGM's debt, had been trying to fix a merger of the study with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, the recent discussions between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Tech Toys wants to keep your gift budget balanced
While the iPad is the main candidate to be the most wonderful toy this year, followed by, perhaps, the Microsoft Kinect video game system, both can mean a significant mile in your gift budget.
Consider that for the price of an iPad you can buy five $99 BMX bikes each, and a Kinect game costs the same as 10 classic jump strings adorned with accounts, or approximately 48 Play-Doh cans.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
Recently I visited three domestic toy sellers, Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholeesale Club, to see what electronic toys could buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that the Moore Act has been working; this year's technological toy will probably have more power, costing the same and even a little less compared to last year's.
In addition, while there are generally fewer new toys with associated websites, two of the most known of these types, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And toys powered by button stacks are increasing, as well as toys with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise indicated).
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for 3 years and more) are kitten toys the size of a guinea pig who sing a note when their belly is tightened.
A squeeze is equivalent to a note, and a second squeeze begins to set up a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing in harmony.
Caution: Once it starts pressing, it cannot stop.
For song combined with dance, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, for 2 years and more) is the best option.
Borrowing from last year's Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animated doll plays turn-shift games like Simóm Dice, and can make the lunar step, thanks to its innovative feet articulated with wheels with locking device.
The children who tried the toy used Mickey as a dance instructor, although their parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child in the 1980s, you can remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
He has returned (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for 3 years and more), with a backpack full of questions letters designed to convert a car ride into a session with an existing self-correction exercise notebook.
If you are anxious to give your child your smartphone, here you will find three independent alternatives.
VTech MobiGo ($60, from 3 to 8 years old) is the cheapest and easiest to use, presenting a qwerty keyboard; although games do not teach as effectively as the Leapster Explorer ($70, from 3 to 12 years old), it is the first major point on the Leapster line, with a newer and brighter screen.
No version is compatible with old cartridges.
iXL from Fisher-Price ($90, from 3 to 7 years) uses an iTunes-type system to present electronic games and books, and has a SD card slot that allows you to view family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash (30 dollars, Hasbro, for 8 years and more) is a game of five blocks just bigger than a pair of glasses, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to set words by putting the blocks in line before time is over; it is great for an improvised competition of word-arming.
More and more toys have some kind of online connection.
Based only on their presence in toys, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your son an online pet at Club Penguin, for example, you can get a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, from 6 to 12 years old) that includes a coin with a hidden code.
When you change the online code, your child gets enough credits at the Club Penguin store for two items.
These could include skates on wheels or a Puffle pet toy.
slightly larger than the pig in his toothbrush, Hexbug Nano (10 dollars, for 5 years and more) is the last in a line of microrobots powered by button stacks.
The fake insect moves quickly over 12 legs of silicone that vibrate, in random directions.
It is fun to make a maze of blocks to see if you can find the exit.
It's also durable.
Ours was able to leave the kitchen table and even spend a while inside our dog's mouth.
Promoting a more moderate side of order maintenance in China
As an urban sergeant instructor, Tang Shenbin marked the step in a city square, severely inspecting the nervous people in charge, issuing orders in a low voice with military authority.
He wanted the female members of Chengguan, the stubborn police officers of the urban order of China, feared and despised by their energetic capricious measures and their inclination to violence, to communicate a certain impression to a handful of spectators.
"Signs!"
"Warning!"
Show them, he whispered, "How are the pretty girls!"
Four girls who barely passed adolescence with white gloves and identical olive green jackets and tight pants to draw attention.
Four pairs of perfectly aligned black shoes.
Four elegant hats placed perfectly above the hair tied with blue and white striped fists.
"Personally, I think you have a normal look," said Mr. Tang, maliciously.
"The models are beautiful."
More than one government has tried to clean up the image of the urban inspectors of China.
A city ordered all new recruits to have a degree degree.
Guangdong Province changed the grey green color of the uniforms to a supposedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced the use of force by intimidation looks: in 2009, according to a report, 50 officers surrounded a distilled snack cart, and observed it with the frown constantly for half an hour, until the travelling salesman picked up his stuff and walked away.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, has chosen a radical image change.
Since 2003, the district has added 13 women to its urban police, specifically elected by their appearance, proportion and youth.
The idea is to give the police cough a softer side, female.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson would have to fight to increase China's low respect for these city squadrons.
And for good reason, they would argue with critics.
Unlike the police, these officers are authorized only to enforce city ordinances, imposing fines and other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese news media routinely portray a different reality.
In January 2008, the inspectors of the Province of Hubei shot a passerby after using their cell phone to film them while they dissolved a protest against a landfill.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors was stolen and published on the Internet, in which it was described as effectively scourgeing offenders without bleeding them.
This year, a Shanghai Sandias street vendor suffered brain damage after a kidney with five officers.
A video game full of violence, available for download online, presents inspectors trained by the Chinese who attack street vendors.
"Chenguan has left a scar in the government," lamented China Daily, a national publication, last year after another tactical dispute.
The newspaper demanded "a really meticulous cleaning."
Skeptics say the current approach is far from this.
After the district had requested eight new female recruits through a notice in October, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News wondered whether women had real duties or were merely a stage distraction.
The answer seems to be a little bit of both.
The district's notice called for female candidates from 18 to 22 years old, with a good figure "and the five harmonious facial features".
They should have a height above average, above 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1⁄2 inches.
Retirement at age 26 is mandatory.
Officials said that work was physically too hard for women over 25 years of age.
"Your image is the important thing," an anonymous district official told Rednet.com, a nearly government website.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they meet the requirements, such as height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the temperament "and inner qualities".
Women's Chengguans are like florists, he said, and added, "Besides being florists, they will have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the district city administration office, is not eager to support this description.
But he noted that the demands of height were standards in many Chinese work notices for both sexes.
Then comes the requirement of harmonious facial features.
If this means being wager, it is a subject of debate among the Chinese.
Certainly, the disabled or disfigured must not show up.
"We can't let a limp person or a scumbag come to work here," said Mr. Zheng.
"Your image wouldn't be right."
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old, with its colored cheeks and a subtlely curved mouth.
She doesn't think the accent on her appearance is sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" he asked with a sardonic look.
His 21-year-old colleague, Xu Yang, said, "Our work must present the image of the city."
Neither do they oppose their work on a certain time, they said, because they have bigger career ambitions than simply run away from sellers in the alleys where they are supposed to circumscribe their business.
Each morning, the squad faces about a dozen street vendors who are walking or cycling, trying to sell as many tofu pans or bowls as possible before being thrown out.
"Mr. Wang, you have to leave."
"We've told you many times!" said Miss Xu while a salesman ran away on foot, temporarily abandoning her bicycle car with fideos garrisons.
Officers describe their duties as more monotonous than exhausting.
"This is about the same thing every day," said 20-year-old Huang Jing, who studies marketing in his spare hours.
"Very routine."
One reason is that female officers lack the power of their male counterparts to confiscate salesmen's goods.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male supervisors.
This tends to protect them from the sudden public demonstrations of animosity against bureaucracy, which are common everywhere in China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, Yunnan's provincial capital, rioted after the false rumor that officers had killed a seller was spread.
More than a dozen police or Chengguan officers were injured in the night episode; 14 government vehicles were shot or fired.
For the moment Xindu has avoided such violence.
But calmness is only guaranteed.
Only two streets from the peaceful Plaza Baoguang, where female officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered in one corner.
The officers had confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk instead of in a workshop, as required by the regulations.
The owner of the bike screamed rudely.
The situation stalled for 15 minutes before the officers, with bad face, opened up to the elbows to their vehicles and quickly left with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, aged 40, a coordinator assigned to the male squad, remained behind, with his white badge turned to hide his name.
Like female officers, coordinators, 40 years of age or older, play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not taught to maintain an elegant image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," said Mr. Li totally naturally.
"Most of the time is the public who starts the fight."
Prosecutors will not raise charges against Senator Ensign
Senator's lawyers announced on Wednesday that prosecutors from the Department of Justice have excused Senator John Ensign from the criminal charges arising from his affair with a former campaign assistant and his efforts to ensure work through lobby for the woman's husband.
The decision ends with the most serious legal threat faced by Ensign, the Republican of Nevada, who was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate by 2012, until the scandal over his business had national headlines last year and would damage his career.
Ensign's office said he felt "certainly happy" with the decision, which came after an entire year's investigation.
The senator could still face a disciplinary action by the Senate Ethics Committee.
Ensign's lawyers said that the Department of Justice had "informed us that Senator Ensign is no longer an objective of his investigation and that he has no plans to raise charges against him on this matter."
The Department of Justice did not wish to comment on the case.
The announcement was a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Department of Justice, who said there seemed to be significant evidence to indicate that Ensign might have fabbled to violate a federal criminal lobby ban.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents that were first released in October 2009 in the New York Times indicated that Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to obtain lucrative work through lobby, to achieve the silence of Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, on the affairs of the senator with her.
Mrs. Hampton once worked as treasurer for an Ensign campaign.
Ensign contacted several political sponsors to find work for Mr. Hampton and advocated on their behalf after they had hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them, according to documents and interviews.
As Hampton had recently been an assistant to Ensign, he was excluded under the law of lobbying for his former employer or Senate for a year.
Ethics experts said that the unusual arrangement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, appeared in disagreement with the so-called "revolving door lobbying ban", which seeks to restrict former state employees from using their connections to do personal business.
From the evidence that has been made public, "it appeared to be a prima facie case of a conspiracy to substantially violate the revolving door status," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients investigated by the government.
While the Department of Justice officials refused to explain the reasoning behind the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said that the department seemed cautious in accepting political proceedings after several major setbacks to its public integrity section, including last year's decision to abandon the prosecution against former Senator Ted Stevens, in the midst of charges for misconduct.
Federal prosecutors "are clearly cowards," said Melanie Sloan, Executive Director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a defense group that filed several complaints against Ensign in the case.
"This basically means that senior government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," he added.
Paul Coggins, Ensign's principal lawyer, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a prosecutor of the Department of Justice on Monday and another call the next day, telling him that the department did not want to raise charges against his client.
Ensign's defense team had been cooperating with prosecutors in trying to persuade them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement on Wednesday, "acted in accordance with the law."
Coggins refused to explain in detail the legal arguments he gave the prosecutors.
"I don't feel comfortable entering into details about my discussions with the Department of Justice, I can only say that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Elections Commission decided to change an investigation into a complaint separated by the ethics group, which claims that a payment of $96,000 from Ensign's parents to the Hamptons violated the federal electoral law.
The electoral commission said it had insufficient evidence to prove that money was just a gift.
NV Energy is an important Nevada company that had long supported the senator, who obtained lobby work thanks to Ensign's help to Hampton.
An e-mail sent in December 2008 showed that after the company accepted Hampton as a lobbyist, Ensign's chief of staff, John Lopez, contacted Hampton and told him he was "machaching" the Ministry of the Interior on a controversial issue.
Ensign also attended a lunch with Hampton and another client from Nevada, Allegiant Air, and called the transportation secretary to establish a meeting on behalf of the airline after he had hired Hampton to lobby.
When news of the affair first appeared last year, Ensign apologized to his constituents and gave up his position as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After maintaining a low profile for many months, Ensign told journalists two weeks ago that he planned to apply for a third term in the Senate.
When Ensign's spokesman, Jennifer Cooper, announced that Ensign was no longer the subject of criminal investigation, he said that the senator hoped that the ethics committee would quickly follow the example of the Department of Justice and complete its investigation.
" Senator Ensign wishes to continue his difficult work on behalf of the people of Nevada," he said.
Cheshire's appeal will point to Twitter
There were half a dozen of them "chating" in the ranks of the court room.
Minute by minute, they sent reports of the frightening testimony via Twitter.
In the end, says the defense, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the process that addressed rape and children tied to their beds in a house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, the widely followed process of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of a Cheshire family, Connecticut, is ready to reach an official end, with the imposition of the judge of the death penalty voted by the jury.
But Mr Hayes' lawyers have submitted written submissions in the court outlining the arguments of the appeals which they will likely hold in court for years.
One of the most provocative claims that the intense reports on the process, including the widespread use of Twitter by mass media journalists, created "a circus atmosphere", and such widespread and immediate saturation with exciting details caused public passions to exert an inappropriate influence on the jury.
The claim could force appeal judges to deal with the question of whether the new technology requires new rules in the courtroom.
"According to what I experienced during this process, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of the new technology in the court room is affecting the individual's rights to have a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullmann, Chief Defense Counsel of Mr. Hayes.
First instance judge Jon C. Blue, of the State High Court, laconically rejected the demands in a judgement last week, saying that the news media were "carefully controlled" and that there was no proof that the jury had been carried by passion.
But it probably won't be the last word on the subject.
For decades, appeals courts have recognized that coverage of celebrated cases may raise questions about the impartiality of a process.
In a 1966 historic judgement, the United States Supreme Court revoked the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, saying in his decision, in the Sheppard vs. Maxwell case, that there was "an atmosphere of carnival in the process" due to the media.
It is believed that the crime had been inspired by the television program and the film "The fugitive".
Some lawyers said that the appeals courts that examined Mr Hayes' sentence half a century later might be intrigued by the argument that new rules might be needed to control the form of communication from the courtrooms, something unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a general reason for concern about the impact of the new media," said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School, who studied Connecticut's death penalty and wrote a report saying it was arbitrarily imposed.
Professor Donohue said that some appeals judges might be intrigued by the idea that limiting immediate communication from court rooms could make trials more fair.
The issue of Twitter is only one of many issues outlined by Hayes' lawyers, which will probably be discussed for years, delaying execution.
Defense lawyers also claim, for example, that Hayes could have been harmed when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors, showing them scary photographs of the crime scene during the jury selection.
Some jurors said they were horrified by the photographs of the victims, 48-year-old Jennifer Hawke-Petit, and her daughters, Hayley, 17 and Michaela, 11.
Defence lawyers say that they will also question the constitutionality of the death penalty and argue that the judge incorrectly removed a jury that had criticized the prosecutors, and that he had incorrectly pressed for a verdict on his strange decision to order the jury to deliberate for a weekend.
The jury wasn't kidnapped.
But their arguments about the effect of intense process coverage can attract most of the interest.
They observed in a rejection of the verdict filed last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and the United States Senate.
They argued that the media kept throwing firewood into the fire of emotion over the case.
"The daily agglomeration of media tweets, cameras and reporters outside the court," the lawyers wrote, "it was something that was never seen here in New Haven and perhaps all over the state."
Your attention to Tweeter's coverage is controversial.
In some interviews, some journalists said that the complaint about the fact that immediate news was more important than the reports given more slowly, was a ludicrous vision that would make the court's policy on coverage control weak in future processes.
But some lawyers said that appeals courts were often attracted by arguments about the adaptation required in the courts due to social and technological changes.
Hayes' lawyers are pressing for that claim.
In his writing, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court decision, which revoked the sentence of Dr. Sheppard because of the process coverage, and made it clear that they would require new means to require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents the Sheppard vs. Maxwell case of the twenty-first century."
Can civicism build a bridge to unite divisions?
After a remarkable campaign for invective and negativity, a bit of civicism has been unleashed in Washington this week.
Is it a premonition of genuine future bipartisan cooperation or an illusory moment before a quick return to partisan struggle in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and the leaders of Congress did not produce any progress on the major issues to be dealt with during the outgoing session.
But from what they all say, it was at least a polite discussion of the differences between the two parties, as well as a recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than being another empty episode to win partisan points.
The President's deficit committee's public meeting on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political differences between the members.
It seems clear that close interaction over a period of months generated mutual respect that transcends the ideological divide that still separates the members.
That is hardly enough to state that a new era of cooperation has come.
Now both parties are in a trial period, testing each other to identify signs of cooperativeism and commitment, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters for a renewed partisan war.
Reason why the meeting on Tuesday and subsequent assessments of the meeting by the participants were made with a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and are very deeply rooted as to suggest any rapid change in the climate that existed over the past two years.
Whether it is taxes, expenses, health care or social assistance, the two parties are in opposite poles.
However, the November election has softened the mood in Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed with regard to the way things are said," said Pete Wehner, an official of Bush's administration now at the Centre for Ethics and Public Policy.
"They are inevitable after the elections.
Elections arouse partisan passions, which then go out.
That's good."
On some issues, particularly those on the agenda of the outgoing meeting, the Republicans and Democrats had no choice but to find a solution.
Bush's tax cuts are won at the end of the year, and nobody's in favour of this.
Both sides want to find a way to preserve some or all reductions, permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, there is likely to be a commitment to expand unemployment subsidies, probably because the Republicans cannot make them believe they are in favour of tax reductions for the rich, denying the unemployment subsidy for the unemployed.
After the Tuesday meeting in the White House, there is greater optimism for possible treatment of these items during the outgoing session, together with the ratification of the new START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) nuclear disarmament pact.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution warns that successful cooperation in the pressing issues of the outgoing session will not necessarily lead to continuous bipartisanism when the new 112nd. Congress meets in January.
He said, on the contrary, that it is very likely and even inevitable, that a period of disagreement should begin.
"After the things to be done have been done, in the short term psychology will reverse the situation to a confrontation," he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism (which is widely shared) about the fact that civicism can lead to genuine cooperation.
"I see most of what will happen between now and 2012 as an essay for the 2012 main event," he said.
The reasons have much to do with the constitution of the new Republican majority in the House and the voters of the Tea Party, which contributed decisively to its creation.
As the Republican leaders are more aware of the dangers of overstepping their position, they know that they must try to fulfill their promises to cut off state expenses and cancel the new health law.
These support lines are already clearly reflected in initial responses to the recommendations of the deficit commission, including tax reform and increased taxes and retirement age, and cuts in expenditure.
Co-chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have been responsible for one of the most difficult work in Washington and, according to their own assessment, have forcibly introduced the issue of deficit on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the commission of 18 members to publish their plan as an official recommendation, and have been struggling to get close to that figure.
The greatest resistance is among the officers elected in the panel, suggesting that there are at least currently few bases or wishes for commitment in tax matters.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between the White House Republicans and Congressmen.
The first will happen next year in the form of supportive shocks, when the Republicans challenge Obama on the budget, taxes and medical assistance, followed by a period of increased bipartisan cooperation.
What would cause the change?
Public opinion.
There is considerable evidence that, despite the partisanship of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties working together.
If the confrontation leads to a dead end, as happened in 1995, then both parties will carefully observe the reaction of the people.
Anyone who thinks he's missing will probably change course and seek compromise.
However, this can be an optimistic vision.
Partyism and polarization are now greater than they were in the mid-1990s and there seems to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and Congressional Republicans than there was between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans at the time.
At the same time, activists from both parties view 2010 as the mere prelude to a more momentous election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civilization shown this week can be welcomed by many Americans.
But this will take much more effort on both sides to find common points on issues that still divide them.
An American leaked document portrays Moscow as the paradise of corruption
The city's control is in the hands of a "cleptocracy", and leaves some of the bribes and protection money directly collected by the Kremlin, reported the US Embassy in Russia in February.
It was reported that both the police and the Federal Security Service operate huge blackmail systems, which helps explain the high cost of life in Moscow.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses but also from organized criminal groups.
Each strata of the bureaucracy, what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called "vertical authority", takes his part as the money rises on the scale.
The note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published by WikiLeaks on its website on Wednesday.
The note is based on sources whose names have been censored.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow, and blame him for much of corruption.
President Dmitry Medvedev fired him in October, but there has been little evidence of a cleanup ever since.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns an important construction company, have consistently denied allegations of corruption over the years, and he has won several claims for libel on such charges.
In September, when on a Russian television channel he was asked about a documentary that suggested it was corrupt, he said, "It's crazy, it's stupid, it's annoying."
According to surveys, Russians believe in an overwhelming way that their society is corrupt.
But it is unusual to find the details explained in detail, as they were in the embassy report, and it is unheard of for diplomats from a foreign country to do so.
"The direct links of the Moscow City government with crime have led some to call it 'disfunctional', and to affirm that the government works more like a cleptocracy than a government," says the note.
"The criminal elements enjoy a "krysha" (a term of the criminal world and the mafia that literally means "top" or protection) that passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (SFS), the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), and the prosecutor's office, as well as all sectors of the bureaucracy of the Moscow city government.
" Analysts identify a three-tier structure in Moscow's criminal world."
"Luzhkov is at the highest."
"The SFS, the MVD and the militia are on the second level."
"Finally, common criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a void in some areas, because the city does not provide some services."
The report states that the SFS collects money from larger companies, and that the police are targeting small businesses.
One source, stated the report, "explained that Moscow's business owners understand that the best thing is to get the protection of MVD and SFS (instead of organized crime groups) as they not only have more weapons, resources and power than criminal groups, but are also protected by law."
"For this reason, protection against criminal gangs is no longer a priority."
The note notes that while the collection of money is complete, protection may be irregular; even those who pay are subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly find their business closed for one pretext or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times about the fight against corruption, but has confessed that he has achieved little progress.
The embassy's note reports about men taking bags, probably filled with cash, within the same Kremlin.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev has to trust the bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, director of the Indem group of experts in Moscow, in a recent interview.
"But he's a part of this bureaucracy."
"He does not belong to a political class, because there is no political class anymore in Russia."
Without politics, without an opposition, without a separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
At the national level, Indem estimates that corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
In a recent survey on global perceptions of corruption carried out by the non-governmental organization Transparency International, the country was classified as 154 (the countries are classified at least as corrupt).
The revelation of the U.S. Embassy note, which did not occur late at Moscow's night, will certainly cause disgust within the Russian government, and although Luzhkov may be blamed for Moscow's weaknesses, it could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to argue that it is solving the problem.
Interviewed for the CNN by Larry King, Putin suggested that WikiLeaks documents could be lies and reacted furiously by a revelation claiming that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth of the matter is that this relates to our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic policies in this country," he said.
"But to be honest with you, we do not suspect that this would have been done with such arrogance, with such pressure and, you know, it would have been done in such an immoral way."
The veterans of the Red Jemers forced to face the past
In a concretely illuminating classroom, with walls stained and peeled, the director of the Anlong Veng High School reminded the man who had built it, the last leader of the Red Jemers Ta Mok.
"Here everyone loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and worried about his people," said 42-year-old Sreng Kor Ma.
Known as "the Carnicero" for its brutality during the Red Jemeres government, the commander remains popular in this remote fortress of the Red Jemers in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructures, and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Red Jemers surrendered to the government, loyalty sustained for a long time is finally being challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for truth and reconciliation allowed victims to face publicly those who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed here a high school textbook that for the first time teaches the story of the Red Jemers to the children of their former soldiers.
And in July, a joint United Nations court and Cambodia issued the first sentence of a former member of the Red Jemeres, condemning the former head of the well-known Tuol Sleng torture centre, Kaing Khek Yev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these events, anxiety has grown among the veterans of the Red Jemeres of Anlong Veng, complicating efforts for reconciliation and their attempts to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There is resentment and fear among the former Red Jemeres, but they can't do anything," said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodian Documentation Centre, an independent organization investigating the regime.
"For them, life under the Red Jemers was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"This is generating divisions within families."
During the Government of the Red Jemeres of Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, they were executed or died of hunger, illness or overwork, approximately 1.7 million people.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrowed the government led by Pol Pot in 1979, the remains of the regime and its military fled to the border of Cambodia with Thailand.
There they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last movement that took place in December 1998.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from their bases in the mountains and forests of western Cambodia, Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Red Jemer fighters began deserting towards the government, culminating in the surrenders of Ieng Sary in 1996, and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had resisted, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the nearby Dangrek Mountains.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while waiting for the trial.
Without the support of its benefactors, the oldest Red Jemers fighters fell into the absolute misery that is common in rural Cambodia, and many feel nostalgia for the movement.
Although a few Red Jemer elite officials retained their local administrative posts in exchange for their weapons, shaved soldiers remain poor and unqualified farmers.
"These people have obtained few benefits after surrender," said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, offering public forums throughout Cambodia, even in Anlong Veng.
"They have incorporated the utopian agricultural ideology of the regime."
"They were raised without any concept to do business."
Sister Lim, 55, who joined the Red Jemeres when he was a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle near Anlong Veng before dedicating himself to life as a poor rice farmer in 1998.
"Life with the Red Jemers was fine," he said.
"Ta Mok fed everyone."
"But now life is difficult because we have to self-supply ourselves."
The current Court of the Red Jemers has also caused concerns here.
Early next year, the court is expected to start prosecuting Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former minister of the Red Jemers.
The court's mandate is to prosecute the principal leaders and those with the greatest responsibility for the crimes, but it has not stated whether it will prosecute cases in addition to those four.
This did not do much to calm fears in Anlong Veng.
The recent media speculation has focused on 64-year-old Im Chaem, who was a district leader in Banteay Menchey province during the Red Jemeres government in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told the Cambodian Documentation Centre researchers that she had supervised the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project in which thousands of forced workers are thought to have died.
During a recent noisy afternoon, Im Chaem returned from working in the fields to his home on wooden pilots on a dirt road on the outskirts of Anlong Veng.
When the sun cast long shadows over the rake grass, Im Chaem refused to talk about his past in the Red Jemers.
She claimed that if the court called her, she wouldn't introduce herself.
"Cambodia is at peace and stable," he said.
"If there are more trials, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who deserted the Red Jemers in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that there will be instability if the court pursues more suspects, although experts and historians question it.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But facing the past is precisely what Cambodia must do to advance, said Chhang Youk, from the documentation center.
"The reconciliation, according to Khmer, is to reunite the broken pieces," he said.
"It is our obligation to collect these broken pieces so that we can understand."
The center produced the first government-approved textbook on the Red Jemeres, called "A History of Democratic Kampuchea", of 75 pages.
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the secondary school history textbook of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages on the Red Jemeres.
As in most Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng know little about the Red Jemers, despite the city's bond with the regime.
Toque Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said that the new textbook helped students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted with skepticism when he took the book home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the court," he said.
"They have suspicions because they are not sure about the number of people who will prosecute the court."
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the textbook and the court are starting to produce an impact, he said.
Anyway, here the Red Jemers retain a powerful charm.
In the Dangrek Mountains, a road with too many weeds and covered with discarded plastic bags leads to a rectangle of the black horn covered by an oxidized roof of leaves.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a lot of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, a 31-year-old mobile salesman on the road, said he didn't know much about the man who was burned there.
"But he has a strong spirit and many locals go there to pray to him," he said.
It was the birthday of Nuom Sothea, and later that day decided to walk to the place of the last rest of Pol Pot, where he would leave a handful of mature bananas in the hope of having good luck.
Belarus agrees to renounce its qualified uranium reserve for armament
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to protect nuclear material worldwide, the Belarusian government announced on Wednesday that it will renounce its highly enriched uranium reserve, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The treatment was revealed in a joint statement published after the Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton met with the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov, outside a security summit.
For years, the U.S. government had been trying to persuade Belarus to give up its highly enriched uranium and it seemed that they had reached a point of no return last spring.
But U.S. officials told Washington Post that a couple of operations were carried out with Belarus in the last two months, to withdraw 84.82 kg of uranium qualified for weapons from a Belarusian research facility.
This prepared the ground for Wednesday's agreement to remove the rest of the material, approximately 227 kg, according to an official, who spoke from the anonymity due to the confidentiality of the subject.
The agreement seemed to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47 nations Nuclear Security Summit chaired by Obama in April, which excluded Belarus.
And apparently it was a good achievement to secure the invitation of the former Soviet republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit."
"This demonstrates that this process is working," said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Society, a group that promotes nuclear security.
Clinton said the agreement is "a very significant and important step" given by Belarus.
In April 2009, Obama promised in Prague to protect all vulnerable nuclear material worldwide over the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of the Obama Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko had declared that the nation would never renounce its uranium.
"We have preserved highly enriched uranium (hundred kilograms of what is basically uranium qualified for armament) and low enrichment uranium," Lukashenko said at that time.
"This is our raw material... we're not gonna make dirty bombs, and we're not gonna sell them to anyone."
"We use it for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago, indicating interest in reaching an agreement.
The officials stated that the first task of removing Belarusian uranium in October was particularly complicated, as the material had been slightly irradiated.
Officials said it was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 2,000 km to a Russian storage and disposal facility.
According to officials, the second operation ended on Monday and was aired.
The U.S. government spent 13 million dollars for the tasks, and most of the money was used to provide Belarus with the installation of low-rich uranium research, which is not suitable for nuclear weapons.
Andrew Bieniawski, a Department of Energy official working in the Global Threat Reduction, said that "this was coordinated and orchestrated very carefully to strengthen confidence" that led to the agreement signed by Clinton.
The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies estimated this year that Belarus had at least 40 kilograms of qualified uranium for weapons, as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will try to eliminate its reserve by 2012, according to the joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly due to the harsh repression of Lukashenko of human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggested a potential detachment.
It was stated that "while we welcome progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus recognized that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue for improving bilateral relations, and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens."
The Spanish Government did not repair CIA flights
The Spanish Government did not repair the CIA's flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners headed to Guantánamo by Spanish territory, according to the US ambassador in Madrid in a telegram.
This is reflected in the filtered documents (cables) by Wikileaks to the newspaper El País, where it is added that the then first vice-president of the Government, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, asked that the Spanish Executive be informed "to show that they exercised appropriate surveillance over foreign aircraft crossing Spain".
In June 2006, following a report by the Council of Europe accusing of complicity in practices contrary to human rights to a dozen countries, including Spain, a meeting took place between former US ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council's report "had taken the Zapatero Government out of play" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no repairs to intelligence flights through Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" to avoid being "prevented caught," says Aguirre on a cable.
Also the then foreign holder, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, told the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to give this matter the lowest possible profile, although, by being in the hands of the judges, the Government had a limited capacity of influence".
In January 2007, Prosecutor Vicente González told the Embassy that he would not try to block the judge's initiative to request the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence on CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any criminality or sensitive information," the Embassy explained after speaking to the prosecutor.
However, the U.S. reflected its concern at the "apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors", rather than the declassified information of the CNI or the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle the case discreetly between governments," regrets Aguirre.
In March 2007 at a lunch between the US ambassador and the Minister of the Interior, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he commented that "although Spanish judges are furiously jealous of their independence and will do what they consider appropriate," he had instructed his collaborators "to avoid inflamed rhetorical comments in an attempt to lower the temperature."
The Ambassador also expresses concern about the PP's action on this matter.
"Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience suggests that the PP will not hesitate to capitalize on any indication that the Zapatero Government tolerated or deliberately ignored US actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if these revelations have negative consequences for the US Government," he says.
The parricide confessed to complaining on the "agobio" network of being a mother
The young woman talked about the boy when he was already dead and had a blog: "Terror to the Galician"
Monica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" on the network.
With this nickname, which he used from childhood, he communicated with a cousin and at least a friend; the two naturals of Noia, the Coruñé people from which she originated.
The messages belong to 2008.
To understand them, it is necessary to know their sentimental life, that ABC rebuilds through testimonies from their relatives.
The 30-year-old young Galician began a relationship in 1998 with Ivan Tuñez, an industrialist.
They lasted a year.
When they left him, she was soon known to be pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his own, but his ex never let him take the DNA test.
She soon became acquainted with another bride.
The chosen was Alberto, a boy from Lousame, a neighboring municipality.
He came to live with him for a long time.
Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to probe the labour market, the little girl stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But because of the content of the communications, it turns out that his romance broke, that they broke.
In March 2008, he is in Menorca alone, and writes: "Alberto is very rare and mosquitoed, because I came to work."
"When I told him it seemed good to him, but of course, he now realizes what it is to be with the child all day and not to be free to do whatever he wants."
Then he talks about a message to the mobile that he just received: "I want you to come back this month or give me an address to send you to the child."

Populars would earn 4 seats in Congress and PSC would lose 9
With the results of 28-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
Following the significant increase in votes and Members experienced in recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP already has the view put in the generals because, whether progress is made or not, the prospects are more than positive, since the number of votes that this training obtains in these elections usually doubles the number that it receives in Catalans.
Thus, the Catalan people obtained 610,473 votes in the 2008 generals, while in the 2006 autonomics, the figure amounted to 316.222.
Last Sunday, the PPC won 384,091 votes.
By maintaining this upward trend, which has been nourished by a transfer of votes of the PSC and the loyalty of the electorate of the PP, analysts of this training have calculated that, if general elections were held, the PPC could move from 8 to 12 deputies in Congress, while CiU would also win four (now has 10) and the PSC would lose nothing less than 9 deputies (has 25).
These calculations would show that the Catalan square is essential for PP and PSOE.
According to popular analysis, ERC would lose a Member - now has three - while ICV would stay with a Member or win one.
But, if the electoral calendar is maintained, the most immediate appointment will take place in May 2011 with municipal commissions, where the people can also be decisive at the end of socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in their importance in front of the Barcelona Parliament, one of the most budgeted administrations - EUR 661 million for 2011 - .
Both nationalists and populars agree that the PSC may lose the municipalities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where socialists would not obtain a majority or the possibility of resorting to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Given the Republican debacle, it would not be reckless if this formation loses its representation in the Barcelona Consistory - it is necessary to obtain 5% of the votes - .
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced that they can take the lead in the return to the capital of Tarraconian, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP has been located only 500 votes by the PSC, whose mayor, Ángel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they have met several times.
People have also grown up in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Currently, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in the maximum number of populations.
The Catalan cell provided thousands of passports to Al Qaeda
In addition to the seven detainees in Barcelona, in Thailand there were three
The seven Pakistanis and Nigerians arrested by police officers at the General Police Intelligence Commission in Barcelona formed a jihadist cell that, directed from Thailand, facilitated passports to different groups in Al Qaeda, including "The Tigers for the Liberation of the Tamil Earth" (LTTE) and "Laskar and Taiba" (Let), author of the latter of Bombay attacks that caused the death of 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interior has attached great importance to these investigations, to the extent of ensuring that with the "Kampai operation" the Al Qaeda counterfeiting apparatus has been "weaked" internationally and, therefore, its operational capacity".
Researchers estimate that the cell, in the two years it has been active in Catalonia, has been able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were falsified and then distributed to groups that integrate the Al Qaeda criminal galaxy so that its "combatants" can cross the European borders and other Western countries with total impunity.
The dismantled cell is not the only one that the jihadist network had operating in Europe, so that research has participated, in addition to Thai services, other European police units, so it is not ruled out that in the EU territory they are carried out in the coming days similar to the one developed on the night of last Tuesday in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (Pakistans Junaid Humayun, Atikur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested), another development took place in Thailand with the capture of Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
These were the ones leading from Bangkok the cell located in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of it was beaten in 2009 - mainly robbed tourists passports that met the requirements marked by the so-called "World Islamic Front".
In other words, the documents were to be on behalf of men between 25 and 45 years old, with a validity of several years and without stamped visas.
In the media of the investigation it is emphasized that, at the moment, no data has been found that links the arrested in Catalonia to the Bombay attack, although the author of this attack, "Laskar and Taiba", has been one of the receiving groups of passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
However, it should be remembered that days before this attack was committed, from Catalonia they were sent through a transfer agency about a thousand dollars that were "invested" in the purchase of mobile cards that were then used by the members of the "command" that ended up with the life of 106 people.
The police have seized abundant documentation.
The PP requires Mas to park the fiscal concert
The PPC leader, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had an opportunity yesterday to personally present to Artur Mas his conditions to support his investment as President of the Generalitat, identical to those already raised during the campaign and which are summarized in giving priority to the recovery of the economy and to dispense with philo-sovereignist adventures, as is the economic concert that the nationalist leader wants to put forward in the equator of his mandate.
The president of the Catalan populars attended the meeting of Artur Mas with the assurance that he obtained 18 deputies in the elections last Sunday, more than enough to make himself wanted, because the candidate of CiU needs at least one of the formations that will exercise the opposition to abstain from the investment vote.
A possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliances that nationalists want to maintain in Congress when general elections are held, but, at the moment, the talks that these days hold Mas with the rest of the political leaders are made in Catalan key.
And with regard to the president of the PP, to support an investment "will have to park all sovereignist and independent discourses", as well as the economic concert - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the convergent leader intends even to submit to referendum.
Both leaders have in common their bets on thinning the political apparatus of a very inflated autonomous administration and the elimination of inheritance and donation tax.
The details of the negotiations on the Mas investment will be dealt with by the PPC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
But he has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a tough opposition - Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will do so with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Cititan) and Joan Laporta (Solidarit Catalana).
The geriatric claims that the deaths were not "missing measures"
The owners of the center of Olot do not rule out that their cellator would kill more than 11 elders
The managers of the Geriatric La Caritat de Olot (Gera) offered yesterday a press conference to highlight the damage to the institution by the criminal conduct of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who while there employed killed at least eleven elders in charge.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, appeared accompanied by the lawyer of the centre, lawyer Joan Cañada, and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be to be able to bring the charge against the responsible" of the deaths but "legality and responsibility compel us to assume the procedural situation of civil officials".
And in addition to the social contempt that the entity may suffer for not detecting in time the criminal activities of the cellor, the great threat to La Caritat now takes the form of substantial compensation that the legal representatives of the family members of the victims are already calculating.
Joan Vila Dilmé has confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and has not ceased to kill since then.
The judge already pointed out in the car that ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former geriatric patients - that he suspected that in many cases no doctor personally explored the deceased but that, according to the age and pathologies of the patients, the procedure was dispatched by telephone.
Caritat, through her director, denied this extreme yesterday and pointed out that "the lack of measures cannot at any time have been the cause of what has happened".
The lawyer of La Caritat added that "in the case there is no single indication that there has been an unwise action on the part of any other person other than the accused."
The already baptized "Angel de la Muerte" confessed yesterday 11 murders and explained that the first crime committed it on 29 August 2009 to, a month and a half later, kill a second grandmother.
In this case it caused death by pinching him with an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime he committed, helping him with a mixture of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat points out that it is difficult to control that the staff of the centre have access to medicines.
Insulin pins and sedative cocktails would have been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in her quest to alleviate the suffering of the inmates, used to kill them.
But it will be the analysis that is being done in the laboratory that will clarify whether Vila does not lie and sought for her first victims a less cruel death or if, on the contrary, she embraced them inside giving them light as she has already confessed that she did with the three women who killed between October 12 and 17.
In La Caritat they do not give credibility to the manifestations of the cellator, not even to the number of confessed murders, which do not rule out that he is superior, and justify his attitude in the different versions that Vila has given in his visits to the court and in the little sense that he has to change his way of proceeding after he has successfully committed eight murders.
That is why they say that they are made available to justice to clarify the scope of this event.
ECB Threats
The investors reacted sharply yesterday to the Trichet threat that warned "the markets should not underestimate our reaction capacity".
The peripheral differentials have closed strongly and the actions of European banks have risen by more than 5%.
However, we must not underestimate the ECB's ability to make mistakes and the euro has barely rebounded what is a worrying signal.
What happened yesterday is the result of a liquid market that just as it collapses is recovered but motivated by the closure of short and very speculative positions.
The institutional investor will take long to lose fear.
A month ago the ECB quoted us today to withdraw liquidity measures and we will have to withdraw tomorrow for a fourth time in two years and the remaining ones.
The Bundesbank required the completion of the public debt purchase plan for inefficiency and the elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures in time and leaving only unlimited access per week.
Following the Irish crisis, we hope that the current liquidity measures will be extended "at least until March" and that they will maintain the quarterly auction with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We also hope that they will continue with their bonus purchase program and even give the signal to intensify it.
If they fail to meet the expectations generated they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they are still obsessed with withdrawing liquidity measures, God will help us!
As at their May meeting at which they claimed that they had not even contemplated the purchase of bonds and collapsed markets, the story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazuca on Monday and Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday the auction of letters to a year in Portugal has been very poor.
The Treasury issued only 500 million to 5.28%, versus 750 million to 4.81% of the previous auction.
Even so, the rates in Portugal fell 30 basic points across the curve, clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment after Trichet's words.
The figures for the Allied and Bank of Ireland hole have been published in Ireland.
The estimated figures are about 10 billion in the short term and 15 000 potentials and have until February to obtain private capital or will remain nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with stress tests, the figures are assumed within the Aid Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
However, on Tuesday, the Government will have to get parliamentary approval of its new budget and still has insufficient support, so Ireland remains a focus of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel moderated the tone of her speech to ease tension towards the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December, where a political commitment is needed to demonstrate that we are a union and that we all play the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the rest the anthem of Beethoven's joy.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity to present yesterday the plan of measures to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous communities and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment sound in investors' ears such as the four Vivaldi stations.
The double effect Trichet and ZP explains that the Spanish Stock Exchange has risen 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of European Stock Exchanges.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain has been swift and strong and we are benefiting from the surprising effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year bonus that will benefit from the Trichet effect so we hope it will be solved with strong demand and help to dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain to request an aid plan would be self-immolation.
They would give us a liquidity line that we don't need, the Treasury has more than 40 billion cash available triple that in March, at very expensive types and closes your access to the markets without saying.
However, the strategy must remain that of Caesar's woman, "besides being, to look like it."
Come on, we can.
The president of Eulen will challenge the board of Vega Sicily requested by his children
Temporal does not heal in the open conflict in the Álvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, founder of the group, will challenge it by considering it as "no full law", the court board of El Erebro next day 16, requested by five of his seven children and in which they will try to enforce their majority and make themselves known to the management bodies of the Bodegas Vega Sicilia's signature.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesus David and Mary Joseph are fine-tuning the legal battery for the new court chapter in their dispute over the control of the group.
The founder of the company's largest business service holding does not seem willing to give in to its dispute to be present in the government bodies of El Enebro.
Of his board of directors, five of his seven children were disbanded who were appointed administrators at the shareholders' assembly of 18 January this year and whose challenge is recorded in the Mercantile Register.
The El Enebro Judicial Board for the next day 16, convened by the Judge of the Mercantile No. 2 of Madrid, has reopened the box of thunder within the Álvarez family.
The recourse to the judge to fix the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only legal mechanism guaranteeing the convening of the board.
The latest movement of Juan Carlos, Paul, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is described by David Álvarez as "a desperate resource of the applicants their five children to, through procedural argument, in clear fraud of Law and abuse of law, try to validate and heal the radically null assembly of 18 January", according to their official spokespersons.
This argument will be the basis for the Board to challenge it once it has been held, considering it to be "no full right".
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already tried without success for the magistrate to convene a meeting in June.
In El Enebro, a heritage company and holder of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, David Álvarez's seven children control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the services group, however, claims that 51 per cent of the capital is used, according to family protocols.
This is the substantive issue that the judge must decide once the hearing on the application for appeal is held, for which there is still no date indicated.
Red Bull wins in F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
A software designs improvements in cars in real time.
Since Red Bull broke into Formula 1's world in 2004, its history in this selected speed universe has been marked by surprise and success.
At first, no one took into consideration the options of a recently arrived squire and, despite the ascending trajectory of the last few seasons, last November, in the final line of the championship everyone waged for the Ferrari of Fernando Alonso.
Without diminishing the skill as a driver of the final champion, the German Sebastian Vettel, nor the capacity of the Renault engine that propels his car, in the world of Formula 1 has become a legend the "secret weapon" that the multinational Siemens has put in the hands of Red Bull to turn him into a winning team.
It is actually a powerful process simulation software that German put on the market in 2007 for purposes far away from the high automotive competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computer tool has been used to design assembly chains of manufacturing factories around the world, power plants, high precision instruments.
The goal is to reproduce, simulate faithfully the product or process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding errors and avoidable expenses.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi planes or Nissan's most famous utilitarian cars.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the Siemens industrial division, explains that the use of this computer tool in its Formula 1 factory has allowed Red Bull to design and implement "in a few hours, almost in real time", the modifications, changes and improvements that are detected during the races and in the trials.
Russwurm explains that the squireries in 1992 had an average of 10 technicians in their team who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements to the vehicles during each season.
In the Red Bull team today, 180 high-quality young professionals are working, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyzing and projecting all kinds of modifications in the vaults.
Siemens's manager explained that PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all elements of Red Bull’s bolides except for the engine, which is the full responsibility of Renault.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
Changes can be brought from virtual reality of the simulator to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
As the only limitation of this madness of technological development is the figure of $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend at most in each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has set up the high-tech factory to design and produce its vaults in a town about 50 kilometers from London.
These are two buildings in which visitors are restricted, especially for journalists.
Everything that happens there is considered "high secrecy."
The staff for this task amounts to 580 people, including their two pilots, the Vettel champion and Mark Webber.
The hero of Red Bull's Formula 1 is undoubtedly the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the huge technological resources that the brand of energy drinks has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, there are other protagonists whose contest is invaluable and their reputation is nil.
The head of technology at the factory, Steve Nevey, said five years ago that R & D advances in cars contributed 50% of the victories and drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have varied and technology amounts to 85 per cent of success, while pilots contribute 15 per cent of added value.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computer technology as "they are unpredictable gladiators".
HP will install in two years 20 own stores with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened yesterday in Barcelona his first exclusive shop in collaboration are his partner Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of the 20-trade network between 80 and 100 square metres that the multinational plans to install in Spain for the next two years.
The company will support this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centres such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
HP Spain's vice-president Helena Herrero set out as an example the refurbished shop located on the Gran Via Barcelonesa, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom she has been collaborating for 30 years.
The US group has prepared a plan to locate 200 brand outlets in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes 20 Spanish establishments.
The first to open were Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, being the third in Barcelona.
Herrero did not want to reveal the following possible openings, although he recognized that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HP personal systems assured that the philosophy to install the stores will always be the same, relying on a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The American group advises and handles the exclusive furniture design of shops (with products that can be played interactively), which in Europe will have an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of the staff of the establishments.
Helena Herrero denied that it was a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of businesses aims to "improved customer service and SMEs in purchasing, caring, after-sales and even packaging".
The Barcelona store includes a space with a worldwide pioneer pilot program that is responsible for solving the possible problems of HP computer equipment in warranty.
An online service connects with a technical center located in Maastricht, Holland.
"So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can sometimes take up to two days."
"This system is specially designed for SMEs and users, as large companies have already contracted technical assistance services," Helena Herrero noted yesterday.
Sabadell bets on stealing a million customers to his rivals in three years
More optimistic than other directors, Banco Sabadell's CEO Jaime Guardiola believes 2011 will be a tough year for the bank, but initially discards a new liquidity crisis and vatics the end of the passive war.
Nevertheless, it envisages a collapse of the interest margins, which will partly compensate for increases in commissions and the price of credit.
Sabadell hopes to capture in three years a million private customers, his outstanding subject.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit the next three years and thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will launch in 2011 a new management plan that will have a three-year duration.
The aim, in addition to surviving without needing to resort to the public aid of the FROB, is to earn market share with the capture of one million new private customers - 700,000 if those who can get out of the bank are discounted -, their big subject pending, since so far it had spoiled SMEs and businesses more than the retail customer.
This year it has captured 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share in particular is 3.5%, while in companies it is more than 10%.
Another of the bases of the 2011-2013 plan is the commitment for productivity, or what is the same, austerity, with cost reduction as an objective, and whose challenges will be exposed by the bank when presenting the results of the financial year.
Few banks dare to set targets and make them public at this time, as the financial crisis has disrupted all global banking plans.
Sabadell, in fact, will close this year his Optima management plan, fixed four years ago, although initially it was for three, but the situation in the markets made it expand one more exercise.
Customers who let the savings boxes escape will be their main objective.
In a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a "hard and transcendental year".
The executive, in fact, believes that the outbreak of the crisis in Spain "will be slow".
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs", something essential for the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And, although he believes that the passive war - which penalizes the margins - is being reduced, the price of risk premiums that are paying banks and boxes for their emissions to obtain liquidity are already being moved to the credit price to compensate for the fall in margins.
"The issue of liquidity and financing is structural, and will be a pressure factor on credit."
"We haven't closed the tap, but the differentials are higher," Guardiola acknowledged.
Banesto already gave Thursday orders to its network to limit long-term credit and raise the price of differentials - see Five Days of November 22 and 27-.
He also recognized that the banking trend now "is going up commissions", but "there is a competitive framework".
Sabadell's management plan is based on organic growth, although, as always, the group does not rule out corporate operations.
Not in vain, he says that in Spain "greater sizes are going to be required."
"The next year will move everything," he said.
He claims that the capital needs are "very high up" and does not rule out that any Spanish financial entity will enter red numbers.
And it points out that the FROB can supplant the market in fundraising in the face of new recapitalisations.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, it remained important to what some bankers already viticate as a new liquidity crisis.
It points out that it cannot be issued, but contrary to what happened in June, short-term funding can be obtained through rest, which cushions the crisis.
ECSC discards a second wave of mergers in the boxes
The Director General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday that there would be an wave of mergers of savings boxes and stressed again the speed at which restructuring of the sector is being carried out.
When it started the concentration process of Spanish savings boxes, several entities assured that they would not participate in this first phase and would be reserved for the second round.
However, the director general of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Boxes (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday that this new wave of operations would take place.
"I think the biggest part of the mergers has been done, the incorporation of Cajasol into the Civic Bank group cannot be said to be a second round, which there are adjustments."
"Most of it is completely done; maybe instead of 17 let's go to 13 or 14 but all the big processes have already been made and protected by the Bank of Spain, which has collaborated very much too," said the director.
In statements during a breakfast of the Association of Directors and Executives of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta has explained that the concentration process is taking place "at the fastest possible speed, and we must be very satisfied with how it is taking place within the deadlines that in its day, not now, were marked in the business plans with the Banco de España", he emphasized.
"Passing from 45 boxes with an average of 28.5 billion asset volume to 17 with 75.5 billion is a process that has no parallel in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% to be much larger to meet Basel," he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of rather unlucky opinions about the slowness of the process" that show "a lack of seriousness and meaning", because "what the Bank of Spain does is remember that we have to be within the deadline before the end of the year".
The Director General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, said yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in all Europe and "probably" in the world, and attributed a "lack of knowledge" to those who question it.
The director pointed out that, within the current economic situation, "we can be very quiet" with the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, a system that has undertaken a "very important" concentration process and "is going as fast as possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish bank was very well stopped by the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the German red line
Berlin has chosen to remain in the euro, but has established the conditions for the entire Union.
Market tensions have led to a dual government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has advanced new adjustment measures, from tax reductions to SMEs, regulation of private placement agencies or abolition of the 426 euros of unemployed aid without benefit, until the privatization of 49% of AENA, management of Barajas and El Prat airports and 30% of State Lotteries.
On the other hand, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of President Felipe González, has joined the criticisms of Chancellor Angela Merkel for her responsibility to unravel the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
Go ahead that Merkel's position is not a mistake in his communicative policy.
On the contrary, it is again a tusk in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new view of what its future must be, which conflicts with that of maintaining the old traditions of much of its partners.
Faced with European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate about the three possible exits to the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, made up of itself, Austria and the Netherlands, among other countries, while the south would leave the monetary zone.
The second, the recovery of the framework, although now it seems science fiction, with a very favourable stream of opinion, is close to 50% of the population.
The third, a redesign of the euro, in line with the proposals of sisters with greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigour, fines to the transgressing countries, possible suspensions of payments of any of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and has been defined for a long time, so now there is no excuse.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission stimulated deficits, the German Government removed from the sleeve a constitutional reform to prevent them from starting 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany believed should be done ( fiscal rigour and stability plans in public finances), and what its European partners, including France, were practicing.
The second on the front was given by the Central European country when Merkel severely extended Greece's rescue decision.
It was already the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion and the published one were very opposed to the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last few days of October, once again Merkel emerges with a clear position, calling for the reform of the EU treaties, to make it possible to save a country and, at the same time, to force private lenders to run with part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, since it has precipitated the Irish crisis and everything else.
But its proposal, although somewhat sweetened, has been approved and, in the coming months, we should attend the Union reform process that enables those measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that does not plan to cross.
And he is telling all of us that, although we must now take measures with which perhaps he does not agree very much, from that date the former operation of the euro will be over.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary area, in which the offending countries will be severely punished, may be obliged to declare themselves in suspension of payments and, in that case, the private sector will also run with part of the cost.
Germany is pointing out that we must follow a severe path of growth with high savings and investment rates, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
Another alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, such as the one that has presided over Spanish growth in boom years, is simply not going to tolerate it.
The guest is clear.
And it would be wrong not to understand.
It is not just a question of reducing the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they demand is much harder.
And the worst thing we could do in these circumstances is deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulences will allow for greater peace of mind.
And let us take advantage of the window of opportunity they have given us, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also understood this and his double manifesto (the reforms promised after last Saturday's meeting with the big companies and yesterday's announcement of new measures) suggests that despite the criticisms of Merkel, the thesis that we have to put order at home has been opened.
But the red line that Germany has drawn there is, and it does not seem to move it.
And, among the possibilities envisaged, that of abandoning a too crowded monetary zone of countries with little seriousness, cannot be excluded.
So, Germany will always be able to tell us that it has already warned us.
Sports and fraud of law
Cheats like those of Alonso and Ramos before the Ajax demonstrate ingenuity but not will to escape a penalty.
The alleged expulsion of two players from Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the game disputed on 23 November against the Ajax in the Champions League has caused ink rivers to be written about whether such behaviour is anti-sportive and whether, eventually, both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As it is well known, in the absence of a few minutes to finish the game (which his team had already clearly won), the two players deliberately lost time in the time of making mistakes to cause the referee to show them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid will now end up as the leader of its group, both players will comply with the regulatory sanction the next game of the league, against the Auxerre, and will be able to pass clean cards to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee has sanctioned the team coach José Mourinho with two parties and with different economic amounts to the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances such as this or similar is not a new practice, but rather frequent in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, of the rules not written, but followed, of this sport.
Part of the debate that arose in the reported case is due to the fact that it has been played by a team of the Royal Madrid entity (which, in its anthem, presumes of nobility and honour, and that sometimes past has fined its players for similar acts) and to the orchestrated dramatization, apparently by Mourinho, who adds one more episode to his dilated history of histrionic and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether such conduct not expressly prohibited by the regulation contradicts the principles of sport, i.e. whether these actions involve fraud of law; because, in fact, they are actions that are respectful of the sport regulation, but seem to circumvent its meaning.
The question goes on to examine the type of damage that causes the sports spirit.
One of the goods that includes the sports spirit is the physical integrity of the opposing players, an aspect that with these actions was not put at risk, that is, there was no violent game.
Another of these goods that is referred to in the clean game is to prevent the team from taking unfair advantage of the opposing equipment, which also did not happen.
However, the paradoxical of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it did not accommodate what we normally characterize as a trap or fraud of law, because its violation of the rules was not hidden to try to avoid punishment, but precisely its action tried to be the most evident to receive the punishment of the arbitrator.
They waited and gladly accepted the penalty.
Another question is what kind of advantage offenders gain from the deliberate offences under review.
Here it seems necessary to note that the rival is not placed in a disadvantage or benefit in the same party, for obviously the result of the action is to leave the team itself with fewer players.
Nor is it a useful strategy for the next game, because the club will not be able to count on those players.
The advantage, obviously, is that players will begin the next phase of the League of Champions without cards that may threaten their participation in a future game.
But it is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indetermination, because the equipment can be eliminated from the first change, and also with this performance players perform a penalty game and move on to the second cycle of cards, in which card accumulation suspension occurs with a less than in the first cycle.
So, if you go round, it's not so clear that it's an advantage.
In short, these actions do not run counter to the sporting spirit, of which it is part to make strategic decisions that help to make the most of what the rules allow.
In the case before us, the players did not act to avoid the application of the penalty (this would be a clear case of law fraud), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without drawing the punishment or fleeing from it.
Although the boundary between ingeniousness and law fraud is diffuse, on this occasion I think it was a clear case of ingeniousness.
The controversy, it seems to me, arises from two factors: because it was two self-expulsion and the way in which the transmission of the directive was carried out to provoke them.
The damage caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not both ethical and aesthetic.
Offer offensive to capture group Christmas dinners in NCBs
The dictatorship of the calendar concentrates this year an avalanche of reservations for the 16th and 17th.
They proliferate the celebrations self-suffered by employees, who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the tower and the lottery, with the arrival of December they also return the pre-Christmas group dinners, which continue to exercise oxygen balloon for the restoration and leisure of Barcelona, but that due to the crisis have led to an adjusted price offensive in order to capture the majority customer: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros on dinners or meals, coincide with the entrepreneurs and associations of the sector interviewed.
In order to end up complicated accounting, this year's calendar (when Christmas falls on Friday) has concentrated the requests in the week of December 13, with the result to date of an avalanche of dinner reservations for peak days (on 16 and 17) and just movement for the previous week.
As has already been happening since 2008, when the stage of weak cows began, many companies have eliminated collective dinners by budget question.
In order not to miss tradition, many workers keep her paying for her own pocket.
Whatever the situation, some and others demand battle prices, confirms the president of the Gremi de Restoració de Barcelona, Gaietà Farrás.
The employer's representative, to this day, does not dare to viticate what this month's festivities will be like.
"People think about it long before they book."
"You want to go out but you have the alerts on the price issue," he points out.
The business will be good "to those who give quality at good price and with good service", he adds, and recalls that customers tend to drop a step with the crisis, so that the fringe around the 25 euros has become a majority in demand.
The collapse of requests for the night of the 17th is seen in a survey in various central establishments.
The Soteras group indicates that there is a genuine boom of applications for Friday, with the claim to spend less than 30 euros, to which they have responded by adapting their menus to the juncture, with complete formulas from 25 to 35 euros.
In another of the most powerful groups, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda et al.), the peculiarity of the calendar has been more reserved in advance, even since early November.
"We have done the impossible thing to maintain the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes from 19,95 to 30 euros," they detailed.
In AN Group, which abandons El Mussol, Attic, QuQu, and up to a total of 23 venues, they remain optimistic after detecting an increase in billing since the second half and some good, though concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources of the group highlight that the 18 will also be a hyperactive day at the level of groups of friends precipitating the parties.
To its six group menus have added a Christmas, with 30 euros or more as a star budget and the perception that there is a readiness to spend 10% more than last year in exchange for requiring more details, such as cava.
They also see green buds in some companies that reinvite their employees and feel that the volume of the groups is something bigger.
On behalf of the Fecasarm boss (which includes entities such as the Barcelona Bars, Restaurants and Leisure Association), his vice president, Enric Gomà, trusts to start seeing the end of the tunnel and maintains that together the reserves are "enlived", although the customers "negotiated as much".
Yes, the illusion of the festivities has not come down, pays who pays, indicates.
Pakistan's nuclear programme generates great concern in the United States
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at "a faster pace than any other country".
Wikileaks leaks confirm links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of correspondence between the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department filtered by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns that the Pakistani nuclear programme in Washington causes.
Apart from the enlightening and juicy details they offer on the content of the talks and thoughts of the American diplomatic representatives accredited in Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between the two countries in the field of atomic security, rather than going up, "decreases", and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "at a faster rate than any other country in the world."
The particularity of the Pakistani nuclear programme - that weapons are not assembled but remain stored by components to hinder their destruction in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for the development in Washington.
This is listed by the Ambassador in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report prior to the visit of the then National Security Councillor James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to territory under Taliban attack, the noisy dispersion of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials".
The high number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is contemplated, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, as proliferative and reason for keeping the guard.
"Pakistan has had to recruit personnel with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the drop in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who work in nuclear or missile programmes," said expert Yuri Koroliv of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs at a meeting with their American counterparts.
The most innovative of the documents filtered by Julian Assange's portal is the growing cooperation between the United States and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation issues and the high Pakistani pace of nuclear weapons production.
An embassy office in May, which calls communication with Pakistan "frustrating", says: "Transparency is often non-existent; aid offers are either unanswered or discarded."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, a National Intelligence official for South Asia, notes that " despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world."
Ambassador Patterson also asks Washington, during a visit by the head of the Army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to make "very clear" to the person responsible that "the Pakistani Army must end with tacit support for terrorist groups".
To the hunt of Wikileaks' boss
Obama appoints a senior anti-terrorist officer to avoid new leaks.
Interpol issues a red alert in order to track movements and locate Assange wherever it is.
Everything related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated maze where it is difficult to be sure of the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "localize and track the movements" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
In addition, it is not new, but dates back to November 20.
And it has nothing to do with the last leak of more than a quarter of a million US diplomatic documents but the allegations of sexual abuse that Australians face in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks' lawyer, Mark Stephens, says that "the police know where and how to get in touch with Mr. Assange."
It was the 20th day when the international police force based in Lyon, France, issued the order at the request of Sweden, but did not reveal it until yesterday, after receiving authorization from the authorities of that country.
Thus, the 188 Interpol countries have indications to identify or locate Assange "with a view to its provisional arrest and extradition".
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, as explained by the organization, do consider the so-called free-way news network to proceed with a arrest -- which must involve the national police force -- especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, such as Sweden and England, where Assange is believed to be.
The movement has outraged Assange's lawyers, who issued a letter yesterday denouncing that the 39-year-old Wikileaks founder has shown himself willing to answer the Swedish authorities' questions by videoconferencing.
They also remember that Assange requested and obtained permission to leave Sweden from his case prosecutor, compared to the mythical Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, head of security of Stalin.
"This looks like a hunt, not a legal persecution," denounces the missive.
While the world seeks him - and from Australia his mother defends his son's innocence - Assange remains in unknown whereabouts, but not silenced.
Monday granted from an indefinite location an interview to the director of Time magazine through Skype, a conversation in which he requested the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that he was responsible for ordering American diplomats to spy on the UN by violating international treaties that the United States has signed, I should resign," he said.
His opinion was denounced yesterday by the press secretary of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who called the request for resignation " ridiculous and absurd".
"I'm not entirely sure why we should care about a guy's opinion with a website," CNN said.
Obama himself has entrusted a senior anti-terrorism officer, Rusell Travers, with the task of preventing further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama's attempt to undermine the importance of Assange contrasts with the views that these days proclaim conservative politicians and commentators.
Peter King, the congressman who will preside over the National Security Committee in the Lower House as of January, has asked the State Department to consider including Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations "to intervene and their funds and prosecute anyone who gives them any contribution or assistance".
Farther still, Tom Flanagan, an advisor to Canadian President Stephen Harper, who had to retreat after saying that Assange should be "murdered".
"Obama should turn it into a target and use an unmanned plane or something."
Who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist Minister, Governor of Arkansas and possible candidate for the presidency.
"Anyone in the Government who leaked the information is guilty of treason and anything other than execution would be a punishment too kindly," stated Fox in the chain.
Puigcircós seeks peace in ERC with sharks like Carod
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to draw the ninth internal riot in the ranks of ERC, without north due to the loss of 11 deputies and half of the votes.
The president of the party is aware that his resignation hideaway is insufficient for the associates to ex-leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of this sector is today as diluted as its own mentor and that it can at all cause him the headbreakers he had with other extinct currents.
For this reason, the left leader will try to win the new critics with guilds that allow him to shield himself until the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that the more than 200 national ERC advisors will be able to express their continuity in secret.
By means of paperboard, and not by hand raised.
If the carodys want to convey a certain vote of punishment to the president, they will be able to do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid the image of division as much as the image of submission to his person.
In several interviews, he stated that he would not be considered ratified by half plus one of the votes, but added, without specifying percentages, that it would not be good as a result "to Bulgarian".
The next to Carod demands the president something more than putting his office at the disposal of the militia, a gesture that is not valid when Puigcercós controls the maximum organ between congresses.
But when they don't have enough majority to force resignations, they're going to try to agree with the executive on a road map from here to May.
To this end, they look forward to participating in the preparation of the strategic reorientation document that the management will be voting on the National Council on the 18th.
Its intention is to endorse Puigcercós in return for his promise to advance the congress in the fall of 2011, something that the dome already gives in fact.
The leader of ERC acknowledged that "polyphony" harms stability and that its objective is to make the organization, once and for all, able to wash dirty rags from doors inwards.
In this line, it is symptomatic of the article that the functional advisor Josep Huguet signed on his blog.
Considered Puigcercós' ideologue, the holder of Innovació actually gave that the leader will be endorsed "in exchange for various objectives".
And he listed five, of which two stand out.
The first, "recompose" the executive to represent at least 90% of the militia, i.e. to include new faces from the sector for Carod.
The second can be the great novelty.
Huguet proposes that the ERC liquid once assemblage as a operating mechanism.
Thus, it advocates a reform of the statutes to allow for the holding of the congresses through delegates elected by suffrage.
Ending the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, has been an obsession of the Puigcercós team, which has already fought in this direction in the last two congresses.
In fact, the convulsive conclave of 2008 left the responsibility of the management to review the assembly at a specific Congress of Statute Reform.
This appointment is still pending, as the internal tide of the last few years has not been able to deal with the matter.
Now, without critical sectors to the eye, it can be a good time to get it back and try to close it forever.

Maintains China’s objectives of reducing greenhouse gases
The representative of that country at COP16 assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and detailed its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 by between 40 and 45 per cent.
China maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, said His Wei, the representative of that country at COP16.
In its first public appearance at the 16 Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), His Wei assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and to restore its industry.
In fact, he said, over the past four years his country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, it made it clear that China will not change its objectives, but will continue to work together with the international community in this regard.
He noted that the Chinese climate change strategy is divided into four sections: dialogue; capacity building; institution building and support for pilot programmes.
In all these items, progress has been made, including last year's approval of a new Energy Act, which reflects the objectives of reducing gas emissions, he explained.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, the federal authorities have been working in a coordinated manner with state and local authorities to achieve energy saving, efficient energy use and emission reduction objectives.
In addition, it has abounded, is in progress, or have already completed a number of multi-year plans, both funded by the Chinese government and by governments from other countries.
For example, he referred to the Energy Effective Use Programme, which had been implemented over the past five years and had received investments from the United Nations (UN), government and private initiative.
A provincial climate change project is also underway, another for the change of incandescent focus by savers and one more mitigation and adaptation, he detailed.
At the same table, Martin Krol, a scientific adviser to the government of that country in the field of climate change, assured that China's efforts have been greater than generally thought.
For example, the per capita emission of greenhouse gases in China is six tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9 percent of the historical contribution to pollution.
It has also made unprecedented efforts in the use of energy, such as increasing energy efficiency by 20 percent over the last five years and planning to do another one by 2020, it has abounded.
Attached to the Legality Espino Expulsion: César Nava
The national leader of the NAP explained that the former panist leader is in his right to go to the National Order Commission to claim whatever is appropriate to his right.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that Manuel Espino Barrientos' expulsion was bound by the law and that the former Panist leader is entitled to come to the National Order Commission to claim what is appropriate to his right.
In an interview prior to the protest of Gabino Cué Monteagudo as governor of the state, he said that in any case the expulsion of Espino is a decision taken at the local level.
"It is an autonomous decision of the Sound Order Commission."
"Mr. Espino has the right to refer, where appropriate, to the National Council Order Commission, in such a way that it is a decision taken in the field of a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he clarified that it is not time to think in 2012 and that there was never a partnership for presidential candidacy at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez said he was convinced that National Action would be strengthened by the internal election of next 4 and 5 December, in which his successor would have to be elected.
"That (an alliance in 2012) is an issue that was never at the negotiating table, at least not for now, was an approach to the local choice that was successful and met the goal," he said.
The panist leader specified that the NAP supports 71 years of dialogue, so "we are not frightened by internal competition; the county "we enjoy and strengthen it," he said.
He said that the council will no doubt be able to choose the best or the best leader required by National Action for the next three years, hence handing over the staff "to whom the council determines."
"I have that absolute tranquility and openness, any of the five would be proud to hand over the party president's office."
He predicted that the score that the party recorded in the past elections on July 4 would be reflected in the next contents, although "it is not yet time to think about 2012."
"For now it's about accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments emanating from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a cause for observation throughout the country, hence "many hopes, longings are placed in them, and I am sure Gabino will be up to expectations".
When questioned about the criticisms of the PRI to President Felipe Calderón for his speech within the four years of his government, César Nava called on the Prilists to reflect on the genders of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderon; that they begin to defend; that they leave the closet," he said.
He felt that the federal executive holder could make expressions such as those he made in his speech at the National Auditorium, because there was no bite in the country or much less censorship.
Promoting Obama on Twitter law for undocumented students
"If you agree to pass the Dream Act law is appropriate, call your senators and invite them to approve it is legislation," tweeted the US president on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama joined the national mobilization in support of the Dream Act to legalize undocumented students, with a message on his personal account of the Twitter social network.
"If you agree to pass the Dream Act law is appropriate, call your senators and invite them to approve it is legislation," Obama tweeted.
His brief message remains open a cyberlink to a broader document requesting the public to communicate immediately with the senators, since the vote on the legislation is imminent.
"With a vote that is expected to take place soon, now is the time to make your voice heard," he says.
The message was disclosed after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote of any legislation, unless the extension of the tax cuts of the Bush era and the financing of the government were approved.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned by the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other projects, Presidential spokesperson Robert Gibbs trusted that once the tax issue has been resolved, a timetable can be set for the rest of the projects.
"I think there's a long time..."
"We all agree that we have to settle the tax matter before the end of the year..."
"I think we can get an agreement at some point at that time and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
The leader of the Senate's Democratic majority, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that he would request a "closure vote" for the Dream Act, so the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on next Thursday in the Senate, although it is more likely next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or American Dream law would legalize some 800,000 young people who entered the United States before the age of 16, have remained in the country for the last five years and have joined a higher education institution or the army.
But supporters require 60 votes to approve the initiative, so they require the competition of a handful of Republicans, at times when project organizations are involved in intense lobbying to ensure the adoption of the law.
The Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against, and only one Republican expressed his support for the law, Richard Place of Indiana.
For this reason, Dream Act supporters need to join several Republicans in case other Democrats decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
Among the most courteous Republicans are the senators of Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as outgoing Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed Senator Mel Martínez's term of office.
Other Republicans who supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but have stated that they will not support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported John McCain has not defined his position right now.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
With literature they put their finger on the lake
The second round of The delights of the tongue was a walk where the participants made a gala of the story
"That sex in the tongue I understand but...the finger in the lake? what is expected of me?" asked writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second round of The pleasures of the language, a cycle that celebrates literature in Spanish and that this occasion used the subtitle of her question (in another fair the round table was dedicated to The sex in the language, she explained).
The finger on the lake... "puts us in a hurry," the Argentine writer whispered sweetly to the public, mostly of young people, who met at the International Fair of the Book of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz and where Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio and that Shultz would later define as a great story, with Luisa in the first person as the protagonist who seeks to know what the "laga" is, goes from doctor to doctor, from which he does not get answers but clues in the same narrative thread.
From the infectologist it is convinced: "patience is not my strong, maybe it is my wound."
In the end, after a frustrated approach to the traumatologist who stole his breath in the middle of the corridor, but who clarifies it is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the wound is the real open, the symbolic one is the scar".
The protagonist sighed relieved and concluded "of the solace I only learned that it is the real open and that it does not exist", but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the tongue must be very glimpsed.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both of them.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also exhibited a delightful narrative entitled Praise of the invention, where the finger on the lake is not named but at one point it is discovered.
With brushstrokes of magical realism, he tells of a famous witch, who was playing clouds, brought back men who had gone far away or repaired the virtues that a woman had lost, narration that came to talk later America, the great novel to which she did not miss from the beginning her own chroniclers who counted her and quoted Bernal Diaz del Castillo who criticized the excesses of what was told by the conquering captains.
"Some people who invented us all (the writers) made fun of the pretended witnesses appearing in the stories presented as real, but otherwise the story of America would never have been told with imagination to which he lacked even the power."
However, he pointed out "it is the crazy and the lying who best imagine" and is where reality and lies converge, where it is no longer known that the narration belongs to one side or another, where fiction literature reaches its height.
It's actually called the "Cervantine tradition."
"By his inheritance we are what we count."
In turn, the writer Mayra Montero embraced and applauded the variety of interpretations to which the FIL's invitation with its round table The finger on the wound resulted.
The Cuban-Puertoristorique pointed its way towards the great scourge of social violence that passes through its country - and shares Latin America - product of the disputes of drug trafficking and sale.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit commitment that is of course not premeditated," he said, after quoting that the reality of literature is the communication and dimension of the commitment that is established between authors and readers, and that in a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
In the evening she was closed by Spanish poet Luis García Montero whose intervention also emphasized "that finger on the wounds of the committed writer".
He considered that in a world that lives in haste, also in intellectual customs and control of consciousness that leads to dogmatism, forgetting "that behind every statement there is a small no and behind every denial there is a small yes".
"To be the owners of our thinking and to be the owners of reality we have to nuance: and nuance means many times to put the finger on the lake and disturb those people who are much more comfortable thinking about caricature, in white and black, in established ideas and without shade and also disturb the powers that prefer a world in black and white," he said, inviting to recover the sense of writing.
Roman goes for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats at the end, he has had high heights in his career, but has already managed to reach the decisive series three times.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the end, they also face two different styles marked by their technicians, who encounter each other with a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats at the end, he has had high heights in his career, but he has already managed to reach the decisive series three times, although so far he has gone blank and that is why this occasion is very special to him.
The Argentinian has ended up comforting the medal of the sub champion, has been one step behind the winners and curiously with the same team has played consecutive finals.
The saintly strategist arrived at his first final as a coach at the 2002 Opening Tournament, when he wore the reins of Morelia with which he fell overall of 4-2 before Toluca; later, in the 2003 closure he also reached the decisive duel and also lost him overall of 3-1 and went precisely before Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna, in the 2010 Bicentennial Tournament, again before the Devils, Rubén again suffered a reversal, as his team ended 2-2 tied up with the choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the penalty mark he took advantage of 3-1 with two opportunities to seal the title for finally three players his failed since the 11 steps and suffered the 4-3 lap.
Reuben already lost two endings with the Red Devils and one with Monterrey, his rival in turn, so he doesn't want to run the same luck, seeks to get rid of the evil and be able to celebrate for the first time a title, although he claims that for him the most important thing is the institution.
"I want to go out champion, I don't want to break any statistics, this is for a club, for a hobby to which I owe myself and as a result the title will come to me, but the above is the most important thing," said the tiller when he questioned about the numbers he has against playing finals.
Very effective has the previous ending, which, he says, has learned a lot, "the only teaching we can have is that until the referee whistles the end we cannot celebrate, we are prepared in the strip, the players too, because the previous time, with two penalty to throw, we were already ready to run out and I think that is a teaching, until the party is over we can celebrate."
Knowing that this series could be defined in criminal shootings, something that does not bother him, because he trusts his players: "One never seeks to get to the mark of criminals, one seeks to finish in regular time, but sometimes there is no other and we must be prepared, in the previous tournament we were prepared, unfortunately made us a bad move fate, sometimes by the nerves or the anxiety of having the title in our hands, but it went away, that left us something for this end that we expected not to reach that instance."
Romano has in his hands to stop being a sub-champion technician and for the first time test the glory that gives the titles.
EU changes rules for obtaining visas
Persons should visit Visa Applicant Service centres prior to their interview with the Consular Section; the cost will be lower as well as waiting time.
From 10 January 2011 it will change the procedure of processing a visa at the United States Embassy and consulates.
With the new procedure, most applicants will have to go to the Visa Applicant Service Centres (ASC) prior to their interview with the Consular Section.
The CSA staff shall take biometric information from the applicant, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages for applicants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, it will no longer be necessary to make a payment to conclude the appointment, another payment to process the visa application and another for the courier service to deliver the document.
The applicant will only make a single payment that will cover all three services.
The current rate will remain unchanged: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visa cases on request (including temporary worker visas) and $390 for trader and investor visas.
People wishing to renew their visa will not have to go to an interview with the Consular Officer, but will only go to the nearest AUC where they will present their documents and take their tracks.
Because biometric information will be taken into the AUC, applicants who require a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will remain in less time than in the past.
Similarly, those applying for visas in the Consulates in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra service fee of $26.

NASA will announce extraterrestrial life finding
The U.S. Space Agency quoted the press to present tomorrow a finding that will impact the search for living beings in space.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States will announce tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery, which could prove the theory that extraterrestrial life does exist.
The finding will be presented in a press conference tomorrow at 1 p.m. at NASA headquarters in Washington by experts in astrobiology, science described as the one responsible for studying the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
In quoting the press, NASA stated that it will present "a finding that will have an impact on the quest for extraterrestrial life," which led to speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures at our side and in hostile environments that were thought to be uninhabitable, and would put on the table the possibility of them becoming intelligent beings like humans if they improve the conditions in which they live.
It seems to be a microbe that was found at the bottom of the Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that was thought too poisonous for any form of life, as the lake is rich in arsenic.
In some ways, the creature uses arsenic as a way of surviving and this capacity increases the possibility that similar life may exist on other planets, which do not have our benevolent atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be shown that "there is another way of life, a second way of life, different from what we know."
The space agency will make known the true scope of the findings at the press conference tomorrow Thursday.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (the largest moon of Saturn), from the perspective that his chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
PRD, PT, Convergence and Pattern 'block' opposition
With reforms to Congress's Organic Law, it gives rise to the arrival of 'bipartisanism', they denounce.
The 60 Legislature was not installed when in Congress an opposition bloc arose, led by PRD, PT, Convergence and Jesus Manuel Patron Montalvo, who declared himself independent, and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of bipartisanism in the House.
Before starting the installation session of the 60 Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergence; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of the PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of the PRD; and Patron Montalvo, 'tronaban' against the reform of the Organic Law, since it excluded them.
With this reform, they reiterated, it starts bipartisanism, because now there will be two people, of the same number of parties, who will control Congress.
These four deputies, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the Board of Directors, headed by Panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, as vice president.
Corvera Quevedo, explained that these reforms institutionally constitute the political marginality of the PRI and PAN.
He explained that in the coming days they will speak with the representatives of the PAN and PRI to modify the scheme, starting from a political will, and if they do not, then they will be devastated again by both parties and the opposition coalition ended with this.
"So far it has arrived (the opposition coalition), is what I look at, because we are excluded, from any decision, they don't even have the political difference to consider the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergence, mentioned that with the PRD, PT and Patron, there are coincidences and therefore are forming a plural group.
It is not possible, he continued, to allow Congress after being monopolistic, to be now "duopolic".
"It is not the spirit of reforming the law that there is eternal bipathism in Congress."
To begin with, this group is starting with 5 legislators, and they are chatting with other colleagues to make them more, the convergent abounded.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, from PT, explained that at present Congress became a 'botten' between two, alluding to the PAN and PRI.
"Before it was just a game, now they're sharing it between two."
Patron Montalvo, asked to respect the personality of the Member, was given his place at the negotiating tables.
"Not by cupular agreements, leave out 5 that we are probably going to make 9 Members, save the five who see us, separated into different fractions, we have decided to unify ourselves to find a place at the negotiating table, that is the subject that in the reform they made they agreed to, we are out and we are not in agreement with that reform."
Sale $200,000 more for "the supplier"
Pays Mazatlan City Hall another check to the contested owner of electrical equipment company.
A check for just over 200,000 pesos in favour of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Hall.
With this, the amount paid in this second half to the owner of the electrical equipment company is 1 million pesos.
According to the Municipality's transparency page, this last check number 9258447 was issued on 16 November, by the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, under the concept of "discontinuation of accounts payable".
The Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had anticipated that more money would come out of the Commune in favour of this supplier, which was observed by the State High Audit for selling at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total still owed to him and thus how many checks are left to be issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing has been bought, you are simply being paid what you owe, just like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two on 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and the latter on 16 November.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal of the State, as the Law states when a company is questioned by the ESA, in order to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasurer asserted that they have not used their services again.
The above, after a review to the cheques issued by the City Council to its suppliers on 25 July, in which it was revealed that, from March 2008 to July 9, 2010, in the triennial of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, Camacho Palazuelos paid the Municipality more than 10 million pesos, through 42 checks.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, where he collected cheques for more than 3 million pesos.
Urgency to attend tourist sites
They regret tourists' business accidents of the foreign tourist for poor conditions of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlan.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a collapse of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourist sector in Mazatlan asked the authorities to pay attention to areas and sites that are in poor condition and that project a poor image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Traders of the Golden Zone, recalled that on several occasions they have denounced that they are looking after the image of fate and reverse the evil that tourists find with new activities or routes.
He said that the poor state of the streets and banquets has affected because tourists come to walk and see the disorder and turn it around to nearby businesses.
"Politics don't know what it's like to close a company one day and have no idea of the money that is lost, or otherwise they didn't do the works this way in such a long time and without proper planning."
Hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance by the City Hall.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and prevent it from passing again, how to do so by providing preventive maintenance and not falling only into the corrective," he said.
"We are eager to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area must be maintained, but as inhabitants we deserve a clean place to live and the City Council must change its strategy to keep the city well."
There are other sites that also look careless and incomplete, he said, like the Mazatlan Shield and Venadite.
"Today, for the tourist to come not only depends on the promotion, there must be a good product, a city that has cleaning on its beaches, on its avenues, permanent maintenance in what are tourist attractions," he said.
"No proper attention has been given and this type of fact highlights something that is notorious for everyone, maintenance is needed."
Raúl Llera Martínez, Assistant Secretary for Tourism Promotion, said that the rescue of tourist sites in Mazatlan is urgent, as they are not properly exploited and project a bad image.
He spoke of a number of places that should be put in line with the municipality and be priority to have the city up to date, clean, tidy and attractive because it is of touristic vocation.
" Fortunately Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites and places that will have to order first, clean and put us online to make them attractive in order to add them to the inventory we have to promote to the destination."
Requests IP results to Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CEC, proposed that Members assume the great responsibility to be an example of seeing a better Sinaloa for the various challenges it faces.
A legislator of decent and free work of agreements between parties and the state executive demands the business sector of Mazatlan, because there is a convulsed Sinaloa that faces great problems.
Since yesterday the 60 legislature was installed, consisting of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 of the PAN, three of the New Partnership Party, two of the PRD, one of the PT, one of Convergence and one more of the PVEM, which amounts to a total of 40 popular representatives.
Among the list of expectations of the new members of the State Congress is that they come to conduct clean and committed management with society and with the different sectors that require responsible legislative work and that the same patterns of partisanism or paternalism are not repeated.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, president of the Business Coordinator Council, proposed that the newly premiered 40 members of the State Congress assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing a better Sinaloa for the various challenges it faces.
"We hope that Members will actually exercise their right, free from agreements between the parties because it is customary to make arrangements to ensure their own interests and become carnival parlances of the rulers and leaders of the parliamentary fractions."
He therefore spoke of certifying the commitment to establish the necessary bridges to move the Governing Body forward in turn.
"We look forward to doing worthy work and above all committed to society and the sectors because it was the signalians who gave them the vote of confidence in the past elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Association of Three Islands Hotels, considered that one of the major challenges of the 40 popular representatives is to push and join forces in search of the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is very complicated.
"The most important thing is that they push economic growth, which generates incentives for investment and infrastructure and that will somehow encourage job generation."
With regard to tourism, he asked that the new legislators give him the weight he had within the state budget to strengthen the State Tourism Secretary.
"I understand that it is the second Secretariat in the state with the lowest budget and is inconsistent as an important economic activity that generates currency and investment and that directly competes with the agro-industry."
In addition to the need to label resources for detonating tourism projects and to assist in providing security to the state and in updating the Alcohols Act that could not be resolved in previous legislatures.
Looking for a Magic King
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the longing of the children of the family Coronado Valenzuela.
For their parents, the next King's Day will be hard to please their illusions, as their home is made up of nothing more and nothing less than 12 people and a chivo.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, Maria Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchor, Gaspar and Baltazar will give them the toys and clothing they so desire.
The family lives in a humble home of the Colony Salvador Allende and lives up to date because the father does not have a fixed job.
"For sometimes we see it hard because my husband doesn't have a shambah, but we sell mandarin and pope... I'm going out with the rains to sell to the street in the afternoon," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Adelaide, 4 years old, wants a doll or a bike, while her sister Isabel, 3 years old, would like a Barbie doll.
For his part, José Alfredo, aged 10, has long aspired to have a 'monster' car and for his 8-month-old brother Jesus, Cayetana suggests clothing size for one year.
"He told me (José Alfredo), 'I would like this monster', but I told him 'Let's go see son', because he was very expensive," Cayetana said with sadness.
For older children, those in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
Mary Guadalupe, 11 years old, is size 12; Isaiah, 10 years old, is size 10, while Michael, 8 years old, is size eight.
José Juan, 14, lacks tennis, so a pair of sizes five and a half or six would be very helpful.
If you want to help make the dream come true of the children of the family Coronado Valenzuela can participate in the campaign A Mago King is sought, donating a toy or cash at the reception of Northwest.
Fourteen alleged drug traffickers arrested
On Wednesday, in Estrie, a dozen persecutions have been carried out as part of the dismantling of a Cannabis production and sales network.
Fourteen people have been arrested who will face various charges.
Persecutions have occurred in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mainly in the places where drug production was being carried out.
"About 750 plants of Cannabis have been seized, four kilos of hashish, money and equipment for production," says Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesperson for the Security of Quebec.
In total, eleven men and three women, including the two alleged network leaders, have been arrested, two Sherbrooke men.
The detainees had to appear at the Sherbrooke courthouse within hours of their detention.
They could face the production charges of Cannabis, possession with the aim of trafficking, plot and service theft, among others.
These persecutions have taken place after a long investigation that has lasted about a year.
"It was the information provided by the public that allowed us to carry out our arrests," said Mr Ruel.
Some seventy officers from the Quebec Security Estrie investigation module, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Department participated in this operation.
Combating illegal migration will be possible without problems
The draft Law of Conservatives which, according to the Government, should solve the problem of fathers charged with clandestine migrants, would surely face a great opposition, since the three opposition parties had announced Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I'm mainly based on the Charter."
"I meet here with a party that has created the granite that you weigh," said Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by deputies after the weekly meeting of the caucus.
Liberals argue that the bill in its current form, which would allow anyone from a ship identified as transport of illegal immigrants to be detained for up to one year, infringes the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
Quebec Block leader Gilles Duceppe also indicated that he could not support the bill because he pointed to the wrong target.
"We are against and, as it seems, all opposition parties are against the project, so we will see what the government is doing," said Mr. Duceppe.
The NPD's criticism of immigration, Olivia Chow, has rejected criticism from a penitentiary that its party is not firm enough with illegal immigrants.
"Neo-Democrats agree that action is taken against those responsible for clandestine fathers and that is what we intend with another bill, the C-35," said Mrs Chow.
"We do not support the Conservative bill because it attacks refugees and imprisons children for a minimum of one year," explains Mrs Chow.
The Minister of Immigration, Jason Kenney, has accused the parties of the position of playing politicians and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"The vast majority of Canadians tell MPs that they do not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations against Canada and that they treat the country as a felipus."
"Wait for Canada to take firm action," said Minister Kenney.
The Government has not announced a vote of confidence on its bill, which could lead the country to elections as a result of its rejection.
However, one Conservative informed the QMI Agency that the Government was going to request a vote to be held so that each Member who is going to oppose would later be explained to his constituents.
The new unit does not achieve unanimity
Although the possible establishment of a permanent anti-corruption and collusion unit by Jean Charest had been announced, many observers continued to call for the establishment of a public consultation commission on the issue.
The Minister of Public Security, Robert Dutil, supports that this idea has not been raised two days ago: Quebec would have consulted with the New York Department of Investigation was a matter since January last year.
Metropolis has a permanent unit against corruption since 1870.
Therefore, Tuesday's announcement has caught more than one by surprise.
It should be said that, during a meeting of the Permanent Council on Police Services held in Quebec on 29 October, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
That was enough for the Quebec party critic who deals with the issue of public security, Stéphane Bergeron, to call this ad as "a rabbit pulled out of the spark" and as "a last-minute hat solution".
Minister Dutil, for his part, has responded to those who fear that political power will have too much influence on the possible future unity.
"You'll see the results when we announce it," he simply says.
"We are aware of this problem."
For the president of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, there is nothing that can replace the launch of a public survey.
"The more Mr Charest refuses to avoid the creation of this commission of inquiry, the more people share our view, that is, that he has something to hide," he explains.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry is with the resignation of Jean Charest," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To get out of this dead point, suggest Quebec to grant a special mandate to the general interventioner to conduct a poll on collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the general interventioner," he concludes.
He also considered that Quebec could confer on the intervener the same powers as a Commissioner, thus allowing people to testify.
The creation of a permanent squad is not the only project in the Charest Government.
Quebec also requests Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to better adapt to this type of crime.
This request appears to be from the Prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who has informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that case law is not explicit in this type of investigation.
The Federal Minister for Public Safety, Vic Toews, has confirmed that his Justice counterpart, Rob Nicholson, is currently inclined to make certain amendments on this subject.
During the Spring 2001 operation related to motor groups, although the Criminal Code had not been adapted, 131 persons were arrested.
Subsequently, Ottawa promoted the adoption of the Gangsterism Act.
Rivers under extreme surveillance
Several watercourses are being closely monitored due to the heavy rainfall that has occurred in several regions of the province since Tuesday.
On Wednesday afternoon there was a landslide in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
As a preventive measure, two houses have been evacuated.
At night, another landcourse took place in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudière.
A road went down.
From Tuesday to Wednesday night, several regions recorded heavy rainfall, between 40 and 70 millimetres of rain.
In addition, additional 20 to 40 millimetres are expected from now until Thursday night, depending on the region.
The sectors located north of the river and in the Outaouais valley were the most affected.
They could receive up to a total of 100 millimetres of rain.
As these rainfalls add to the snowfall that has already accumulated in certain sectors, it is feared that various rivers will overflow.
On Wednesday night, the Quebec Civil Security Unit issued alerts for the Ouareu and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
The rivers of the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentides, and in the Chêne, in Lotbinière, have already caused floods in the past and are under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall has caused some lakes to disembark in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, the heavy rains have dragged a temporary bridge.
As a preventive measure, ten residences have been evacuated.
In Outaouais, the overflow of certain lakes has caused the closure of several routes, particularly in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The Civil Security Unit remains alert and monitors the situation closely, as indicated by Annnik Bouchard, Security Adviser.
The Quebec Growth Prediction Centre, for its part, issued Wednesday announcements communicating the strong growths of several rivers, in particular the Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareu, Achigan, Batscan and the Wolf.
partially Blame Dupont
The radio presenter of Quebec Stéphane Dupont has suffered a certain set of setbacks to the Canadian Council of Radio Television Standards (CCNR) for controversial statements regarding social assistance and Haitians, as well as their gross language on the radio.
The CCNR considers that Mr. Dupont and his team at CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their views, but certain statements contained "inaccurate information on social assistance, unduly negative representation of Haitians and rough language that should not be used in broadcasts during the day".
The Council has also indicated that the debates on suicide, including the dissemination of the name of two people who had committed suicide, do not violate the broadcasting codes.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding comments made in broadcast emissions between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint from the common Front of persons receiving social assistance from Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts mentioned in the issue were not correct.
Presenters should communicate reliable and not misleading data.
Regarding suicide, the presented Stéphane Dupont had stated that suicide was an act of cowardice.
Most members of the Committee have concluded that the message transmitted was that suicide should not be considered as a solution to life problems.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes questioned by "Dupont le medi" have dealt with a sensitive subject in a fair and appropriate manner."
In this regard, any blame has therefore been dropped.
The last dispute referred to statements made following the Haiti earthquake.
At that time, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had been involved in a media confrontation that had provoked numerous reactions.
The presenter of CHOI stated that he had not made any donations to help Haitians because he could not know for sure whether the needy were really going to receive the money.
The Committee considers that these comments are not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an improperly negative representation of Haitians.
"I've already completed my three-day suspension up there."
"My file has been clean for a year and a half," said the presenter.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the issue of rough language.
In any case, the CHOI-FM radio channel has collaborated "even more than required".
The consequences shall be minimal for the station, which shall, inter alia, announce the decisions once within the maximum time of hearing within three days.
A kung-fu king in Montreal
The Algerian Montrealer Nacereddine Zemmal has had an extremely peculiar tour.
The athlete, who stands out in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and and thai box, climbs into the world's tatamis and rings in search of new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts like kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria," explained Zemmal, who has been living in the metropolis since 2008 to advance on the professional level.
"In my case, I'm looking for fights everywhere because, for those who don't enjoy the game on the ground involving mixed martial arts, there are few competitions in North America."
The athlete, who works as a security agent and as an employee of the UPS company, has recently given bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) amateur World Championship held from 23 to 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won in the categories of kickboxing full contact and thai box," he explained.
"I am currently preparing to participate in the San Shu World Cup in China."
"They will invite athletes who have finished among the first four positions in the last world championship in each category."
"In 2009, I won the bronze medal in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I ended up in eighth place."
"In 2007, in China, I finished the tournament in fifth place, but reached third place in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"The interesting thing is that I've been making progress in every competition."
"In this step, I will be the first this time or next year!"
The "San Shu" or "sanda" is a discipline originating from China in which it is allowed to beat with the fists and feet, as well as to throw the adversaries to the ground.
The confrontations originally take place on a platform and, less frequently, in a ring.
The most famous Pugilist in this type of combat is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, widely recognized in the world of martial arts.
Although Nacer Zemmal should only hold a competition in his career, he will definitely go to the great "King of Sanda" tournament, the Super Bowl of kung-fu.
"This competition is China's most famous and prestigious," explains the friendly boy.
"It is like the equivalent of the Lumpinee stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand).
"It's been an incredible experience."
Zemmal won his first fight, in the semifinals of his category (80 kg), but lost in the end.
"He who has won me is a real professional," she says.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semifinals face at the end of their category."
"Then the champions of each category face to crown a single champion, the king of the kung-fu."
450 million in contracts without invitations to tender
Hydro-Quebec has awarded direct contracts worth $450 million to engineering companies for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the centre of this avalanche of more than one hundred contracts is a consortium formed by BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has obtained without a prior invitation to tender the most important contract, the project management consortium, amounting to 295 million.
The consortium, called Energy gerance, was created in 2004 following Hydro-Quebec's decision to entrust the private sector with its responsibility to manage this important $5 billion hydroelectric project.
In early 2005, the Energy Management consortium obtained the lucrative contract without prior public tendering.
For the Quebec Party, the use of business consortia poses a serious ethical problem which threatens to eliminate competition and provoke a rise in prices.
"It is a new method of collusion and of eliminating competition."
"That is, people, instead of doing it in secret, now do it openly," declared yesterday the Quebec Party MP Sylvain Simard in a press conference.
Earlier in the morning, Mr Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because he said he did not understand how it could benefit the public interest in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, responded in the afternoon, firmly denying a collision with this contract.
"I'm starting to get tired," he protested, defending that the PQ had acted "dishonestly" and "with lack of rigor."
He pointed out that "the minimum" would be for the PQ to apologize.
Consortium formula is a common practice throughout the world.
Normally, it is an alliance with a time limit that allows two or more companies to pool their knowledge to respond to a tender for a complex project.
The Eastmain project presents a high level of complexity, taking into account the magnitude of the works.
The works have already started and will last until 2012.
In any event, the contract has been awarded without competition being involved; it has been a negotiation.
In addition, the consortium formula has ceased to be the exception to the rule in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir published last week, the formula for consortia in the technical advice sector is being investigated in the Government.
A quick look at Quebec's commercial registration allows you to identify more than 200 consortia, some of which seem permanent.
Thus, Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, such as CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin, Roche et Tecsult, and others.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to a single legal person, that is, Dessau.
With regard to the consortium Energie gerance, Minister Normandeau has pointed out that "the territory of the Bay James responds to a particular labour dynamics and Hydro-Québec has specifically responded to it since the 1970s."
The great head of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, of the Baie James Energy Society (SEBJ), has given an explanation that has highlighted the fact that the project management contract has been granted directly.
"If you respond to a bid and there are few participants, your prices will be higher."
"You have two options: you can get in touch with the players in the sector and tell them: we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement with a good price."
"However, the idea is that what matters is not the price, but the competition of people," said Mr Laporte.
The contract awarded to the consortium Energie gerance forms part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Quebec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After the verification, Le Devoir identified 109 technical advisory contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to companies or their subsidiaries, in particular geotechnical laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has obtained 22 contracts, Genivar achieved 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without taking into account its participation in Energy gerance.
All contracts were negotiated.
A total of $449,783.344, including the Energy Management contract of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard has suggested that the four companies that form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "well known from the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau has dropped that the PQ is also linked to these companies, which "finance" it, before specifying that it is more of their leaders.
Responsible consumption barometer. The label "green" does not inspire confidence
More ecological, but deeply skeptical.
The consumer trusts little in sustainable development actors, fair trade marks and ecological certificates to guide their choices.
According to the responsible consumer barometer, whose first results have been published yesterday, the situation is even worse. The consumer is immersed in a media universe by which messages that defend more responsible consumption are posted, but regrets the lack of reliable information and considers that it even slows its commitment.
Even if the consumption of products called "socially responsible" has increased in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those trying to sell them.
Two thirds of them say, in fact, that they do not trust the environmental commitment of companies or the environmental advertising of them, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Centre for Responsible Consumption of the University of Sherbrooke.
Another conclusion: half of consumers question the reliability of the official certificates that bear the so-called fair products, as well as the credibility of the products and brands that bear labels indicating that they are "responsible", says the Barometer.
Similarly, only 14.6% of Quebecers take political speeches seriously on this issue.
In any event, information on responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this consumer sector, currently supported by about one third of Quebec’s consumers.
In fact, gaps and the questionable nature of information make 46% of consumers want this option.
This is the second obstacle identified by the Barometer, after the highest price of these products.
In addition, one third of Quebecers claim to also distrust the alleged yields of the ecological products or services they are trying to sell.
On the other hand, almost half of consumers changed their habits in 2010 and, in particular, changed the brand of one or more products to respect their convictions.
61 per cent have given priority to shopping in their neighborhood stores and preferred to buy cultivated food in their region, says the Barometer.
Greener and more responsible (the responsible consumption index has reached 64 points over a maximum of one hundred this year), the Homo consumus of Quebec loves to occupy the position of the King of Recycling who tries to reduce its impact on the environment by worrying about the protection of the fauna.
However, according to the Barometer, that social awareness appears to be from doors (of his car) outside: in 2010, only 28% of Quebecers indicated that they used public transport or shared cars to defend their ecological principles.
In addition, 39.1% of the participants in this extensive behavior survey, which has just completed its first edition, supports the use of bicycles and walking movements.
A loan for the State to recover eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, to which they have requested financial commitment to the recovery of the eXcentris cinema complex by the Société Angus and the Parallèle, agrees to cooperate, but only through a loan.
The Société de développement Angus and the Parallèle, which expected a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to buy Daniel Langlois the eXcentris cinema complex in the Saint-Laurent boulevard and return his true vocation to the cinema, have not obtained what they asked for.
The Government has agreed to engage in the matter, but under its own conditions.
Instead of the expected donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan which would in fact be lower than the initial expectations; it could constitute a viable solution in advantageous conditions, at least in the opinion of certain public employees.
Quebec had already rejected last spring a first action plan and a request of 12.8 million, but since then applications have been reviewed downwards.
The president of the Société de développement des entreprises culturales (SODEC), François Macerola, who leads the eXcentris file, forwarded a proposal and action plan to Minister St-Pierre.
He sent you a final report a dozen days ago.
However, SODEC received a counter proposal from the Cabinet on Tuesday.
The Parallel and Angus are due until 31 December to respond to it.
In any case, it seems that the hypothesis of a State donation must be completely dismissed.
Let us remember that the Quebec Association of Film Hall Owners and Film Complexes opposed a direct State investment to support the recovery of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture should not finance real estate projects, since it has not done so with other cinema halls.
On the other hand, several representatives of the sector are demanding considerable economic assistance.
Daniel Langlois, the owner of the same, has for ten years carried the burden of author cinema on his premises in the complex, after financing his own construction, which could justify a derogation from the Treasury Board.
The lack of independent movie rooms is evident in Montreal and eXcentris had been able to support his clientele.
Angus and Parallèle, led by Christian Yaccarini, are pushing a private funding campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to pave the way for the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one of these rooms, the Parallèle, has continued to project films in eXcentris.
The goal of future buyers is to reopen the three rooms on February 27, projecting the beautiful film by Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des dieux".
However, Christian Yaccarini has never contacted Le Devoir again and we do not know what he and his group think of the proposals they have received.
The veil of completed Canada rises...
The new U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks reveal what the United States considers to be the Canadian complex with respect to the Americans, but both reflect the feeling of superiority of the latter towards Canada.
American diplomats are surprised that Canadian voters do not think about Canada-United States relations when they are going to vote and believe that President Obama's visit has helped the conservative government get its budget approved in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington that have been made public yesterday offer rather juicy details than really substantial content.
A cable of 22 September 2008, that is, during the full federal election campaign, relates to the extent to which the United States does not enter into the issues discussed by political leaders.
This caused great surprise to the US ambassador sent to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins offers some explanations on this situation.
"Perhaps political leaders are conditioned by a complex of practically inherent inferiority to Canadians in dealing with daily domestic issues, rather than leaving such an election to the United States (as during the 1988 Free Trade Campaign)," he writes.
Therefore, he concludes, the United States is "the proverbial elephant of this choice: omnipresent, but potentially too dangerous to talk about."
The ambassador has even more problems understanding this "sudden silence" because both countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
"Logically, he believes, the ability of a candidate, a party and, even more, a party leader to manage these essential relationships should be a key factor in which voters should think about voting."
This feeling of importance can also be observed the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, business manager in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will contribute to ensuring the survival of the government during the vote of confidence in early February on the federal budget, through which Canada will record for the first time deficit in the last decade due to a recovery plan of between $30,000 and $40 billion," writes Mr. Breese.
Nowhere is it mentioned that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas to prevent it from being replaced by the coalition or that opposition parties conditioned its survival to the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another January 2008 communication signed by Ambassador Wilkins alerts Washington on the increasingly negative image that transmits the dramatic series broadcast in the CBC of the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about the issue of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which little references are made to Maher Arar, to the "No-Fly-List" or even to kidnappings for the CIA to perform energetic interrogations.
Another cable says that during his first bilateral meeting Hillary Clinton asked his French counterpart Bernard Kuchner if Europe would be willing to welcome some prisoners from Guantánamo.
Mr. Kouchner replied that yes, but that it depended "on every case."
At the end of the meeting, they wrote, "he has delivered a document to the Secretary of State regarding Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary agreed to review the file."
Finally, we can mention that the spirits have been warmed with respect to the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, stated on CBC radio that the responsible for this massive escape should be "murdered".
In the United States, Mike Huckabee echoes.
A Global Plan to Renew Lighting
Yesterday, the UN has proposed in Cancún a plan to renew domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in a hundred countries to reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs) in an amount that corresponds almost one third of the additional decrease to be undertaken to stabilize the climate of the planet before 2020.
This ambitious plan is part of a set of major concrete projects that the UN expects to adopt in Cancún to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments in industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if incandescent bulbs, which still monopolize between 50 and 70% of the market, would be replaced by fluocompact bulbs or, even better, by light bulbs of electroluminescent diodes (DEL or "LED" in English), much of the 1,800 million tonnes (Gt) of GEI issued on the planet would be avoided to illuminate humans.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
It is equivalent to 70% of the emissions of the global motor park.
In Copenhagen last year, the major issuing countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed themselves to voluntary reduction plans that should reduce global GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, 5 Gt of this amount should be reduced to stabilise, before 2020, the increase in temperatures by two degrees centigrade to prevent it being uncontrolled.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of energy dissipates in heat form and the rest, i.e. 5%, produces light.
In the case of fluocompact bulbs, energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, energy consumption is further reduced twice as much.
Fluocompact bulbs last between 6,000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those launched by the manufacturer Philips this week (a company that has also participated in the UN study), have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, which allows us to get an idea of the savings that can be achieved with the replacement plan that would be applied in a hundred countries.
These new bulbs can also work with reostats and emit very little heat.
Above that, they contain nothing of mercury.
Several experts have expressed reservations about fluocompact bulbs, since they contain mercury and must be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers provide instructions.
However, the report indicates that the main source of mercury emission on the planet is not the fluocompact bulbs, but the thermal coal plants, which emit a large amount of mercury to produce the electricity that is discharged with the incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report details the advantages that this international programme would offer to each country.
For example, Indonesia would thus save billions of dollars a year on electricity and eight million tons of CO2, i.e. equivalent to 3.5 thermal power stations whose construction would cost 2.5 billion.
Côte d'Ivoire looks forward to the announcement of electoral results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has requested the "immediate" publication of the results of the presidential elections in Côte d'Ivoire, as the deadlines have expired.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and announce the provisional results immediately," points out a spokesman for the UN Chief.
"Ask all parties in Côte d'Ivoire and institutions to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite the pressure exerted by some foreign governments, the electoral commission has allowed the deadline for Wednesday to midnight without the results being published, three days since the Sunday poll.
About forty minutes before the end of the deadline, the CIS president had commented on television that the commission "keep working" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, the demands that the CIS finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round between outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and its opponent Alassane Ouattara have multiplied in the world.
However, Gbagbo's side has had the constitutional Council's annulment of the "fraudulent" votes in the north, in the hands of the former rebellion of the New Forces (FN) since the failed coup d'état of September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the campaign of the president of Côte d'Ivoire, has stated that the voter intimidation maneuvers carried out by the FN in the north of the country had deterred the followers of the outgoing president from voting.
The whole election could be cancelled if the Constitutional Council accepted the complaints made by Gbagbo.
However, Gbagbo's opponents consider that the country's highest court is not neutral, since it is led by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a northern man who denies any relationship with the former rebels, has judged "unacceptable" the delay in publishing the results and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, but has not gone as far as to claim victory.
His allies claim that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows that he has lost and that he has filed a complaint with the Constitutional Council after preventing the electoral commission from disseminating the results, it would be illegal.
The second round of presidential elections on Sunday should have given way to the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country divided into two years.
The United Nations has warned the political class of Côte d'Ivoire on Wednesday that they could be held responsible for possible acts of violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished on the first round on 31 October, with 38% of the votes against 32% of Alassane Ouattara, who received public support from former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% on the first round).
The unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter
According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), the unemployment rate in France has remained stable at 9.3 per cent in continental territory (9.7 per cent taking into account the overseas departments), as indicated by the data corrected by the provisional seasonal variations (CVE) published on Thursday by the Insee.
The number of stops remains at 2,631,000 in continental France.
Data from the second quarter have been confirmed, 9.3% of the working population in continental territory and 9.7% with the DOMs.
In one year, the unemployment rate has increased by 0.1 points.
In general, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter, but they want to work, whether or not they are available in the two weeks to work and whether they are looking for or not.
The situation of young people in the labour market has continued to worsen, with a further increase in the unemployment rate up to 24.2% in mainland France (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year), 25% including the DOMs.
During the third quarter, 637,000 young people between the ages of 15 and 24 were unemployed in the ILO sense.
For its part, there has been a slight increase in unemployment among older persons, up to 6.4 per cent in continental France (+0.2 points in three months or in one year), i.e. 482,000 people over 50, which is 6.6 per cent with the DOMs.
Only between 25 and 49 years of age have unemployment stability been recorded, with 8.3% in continental France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% in all France.
Since 2006, Insee has not published the monthly unemployment rate, following a controversy over its methods of calculation.
Eurostat, the European Union statistics agency, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (including DOM) in October, after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini investigated and arrested
Alexandre Guérini, 53 years old, director of waste treatment companies and brother of the PS President of the General Council of Bouches-du-Rhône, is being investigated and has been imprisoned in Luynes prison, near Aix-en-Provence, as part of an investigation into supposedly fraudulent public contracts.
Alexandre Guérini is being investigated for abuse of social property, misuse of funds and public property, cover, active corruption, trafficking in influences and possession of ammunition, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guerini will fight and answer all the questions the magistrate asks him, not ghosts."
"It is easy to pursue him through a multitude of reprehensible acts, another thing is to prove them," AFP had declared its lawyer, Florence Rault, before his client's appearance.
Mr. Guerini, brother of the PS leader in the department, Jean-Noël Guerini, wanted to convey through his lawyers to the judge, before his presence, a document to explain himself.
On Wednesday night they began to investigate and also imprisoned one of their nearby people, Philippe Rapezzi.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, the only thing your client has done has been dealing with the landfills to be managed.
As regards the allocation of contracts or the destination of funds related to their execution, he knows nothing about this, as Counsel Simon says.
In the framework of this file, he has also been being investigated since Wednesday Daniel Pinna, former director general of the services of the urban agglomeration of Aubagne, due to misappropriation of funds and complicity, but has been released conditionally and has prohibited him from meeting with the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to explain all the facts that have reproached him."
"The investigating magistrate has taken into account the explanations and released him," said his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
On Tuesday night on Wednesday four other persons were interrogated and released, under judicial control in the case of two of them, according to the Deputy Prosecutor of the Republic, Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy general director of the property of Marseille Provence Metropole (MPM), has been accused of "trafficking influences and passive corruption".
Two officials of the agglomeration of Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier have been interrogated by "extracting and misbehavioring public goods by a person dedicated to public service" and "complicity in misappropriation of public funds", respectively.
Finally, Alexandre Guérini's companion, Jeannie Peretti, is being investigated by "covering the abuse of social property".
Among the people who have faced Mr. Guerini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned in a parallel case of fraudulent public contracts affecting Corsica.
Researchers suspect that their societies have a service to whitewash the capital of great banditry.
The investigation is being carried out under several judicial instructions initiated against X in April 2009 following the receipt of anonymous communications, of course fraud in the allocation of public contracts, particularly in the waste sector.
A source close to the research indicates that research focuses especially on the conditions of allocation and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which collects the wastes of Aubagne, as well as other cities in the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Subject Clotilde Reiss: Elisha has exaggerated the mediation of Syria
For more than ten months, between July 2009 and May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher detained in Iran for "spying", has been in the village of the public in France, has alerted diplomacy and has accentuated the deterioration in relations between Paris and Tehran.
Everything under the watchful eye of the diplomats of the United States.
American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal certain unknown aspects of this crisis.
They describe how Elisha has explained his strategy to the Americans to the point of giving them advice to manage their own "rehens" crisis in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of the young French did not occur in exchange for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian arrested in France and sought for U.S. justice for trafficking in materials for the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they reveal the harsh reality of how the French presidency tried to manipulate the media to give the idea that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad had played an essential role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
Actually, he didn't do anything.
A diplomatic telegram written on 12 August 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to manage hostage-taking cases".
Elisabeth's adviser for strategic affairs, François Richier, accompanied by Quai d'Orsay's director for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, spoke with the US diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method.
They advise Americans to do the following to repatriate their own citizens held by force in Iran.
"Make noise," they say, "let go continuously" in the media the words "fundamental human rights", "innocence", "immediate release."
Everything to shame the Iranian regime, careful of its image.
"When the Iranians ask you to stop, do it more frequently."
Because, once attempts to negotiate through discreet channels have been exhausted, "silence will solve nothing," Iranians are "experts in dilatory maneuvers".
Mr Richier adds that the detention of foreigners is "a usual Iranian tactic: taking hostages for political blackmail".
It announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss prison (which will take place on 16 August, the day it will take refuge in the French Embassy) "will require the Iranians' payment of a large amount of money" (230,000 euros).
In addition, he points out that Elisha anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that will "increase".
Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of nearly 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he says.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss gets out of prison after 12 days, but she's stuck in Iran.
The following information is disseminated: Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition requests the United States for illicit trafficking in sensitive electronic material to Iran, has been released in Paris by a judge.
The U.S. Embassy, like many observers, doubt this strange coincidence.
For Washington, close to the Iranian clandestine networks of procurement of nuclear material, Majid Khakavand's release is bad news.
Has France accepted an exchange?
Free the Iranian in exchange for the French?
During a new conversation with Kathleen Allegrone, on September 4, François Richier assured that it did not.
Elisha states, not only "has he been greatly surprised by the judge's decision," but has tried to oppose it.
"There have been intense negotiations between the French Presidency and the Minister of Justice" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government cannot cancel the decision", he comments.
Mr Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand continues under the "close" surveillance of French information services.
The counselor of Elisha marks a telephone number, hangs up and then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian "is currently in a building in Paris run by the Iranian Embassy".
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, Elisha spares no effort, uses communications and "fugues" organized in the media to make it believe that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays an "important" and "influent" role of "mediator".
The Americans observe this activity with some irony and check that manipulation brings its fruit, as several press articles transmit the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 mentions "the media 'blitz' of French officials".
What is the reason for such "gratitude" towards Mr Assad? The embassy in Paris is asked.
"Despite their statements of praise, French officials recognize in private that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then deals with the reasons that led to Elisha’s giving birth to this fiction.
The great communication effort "is aimed at validating Sarkozy's policy of openness towards Syria", she says.
A policy initiated in 2008, which "in the opinion of many critical voices in France and abroad, had just been tarnished as premature and unmerited."
In "exaggerating the Syrian role", Paris tries "to show Syria the praise it can reap if it plays a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also to "sow the seed of discord between Syria and Iran."
The U.S. Embassy knows that from a good source.
On August 11, François Richier confides to him: "Of course, we don't know if the Syrians have done anything or not."
"But anyway, we thanked him."
"At least this should cause confusion among the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it in Elisha.
In a communiqué, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Sirius who had played an "active role in the liberation of our compatriot".
Starting at midnight, young Koreans can't play online
The South Korean Government will adopt a law called "Cenicienta" which will prevent adolescents from participating in online games after midnight blocking their access, as stated by government officials.
A bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to request online gaming companies to block access to these games after midnight to young people under 16 years of age, as indicated by representatives of the Ministries of Culture and Family.
"Many children play all night and then they find it difficult to study in school and live a normal life during the day."
"We think that this law is necessary to protect your health and your right to sleep," said AFP Jo Rin, the Minister responsible for the bill.
Online games will be available again at six in the morning.
Businesses will have one year to prepare for law enforcement.
The government also asks companies to limit the time of daily access to these games when the parents of young people so request, the manager added.
In addition, it will make it available to those who request it free software that allows them to limit Internet connection time.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly give news about various facts related to intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion of global online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, where it faced 58 other countries.
World 2018-2022: FIFA designates the organizing countries
In the midst of the storm caused by suspicions of corruption, the FIFA Executive Committee designates on Thursday the organizing countries of the World Cups of 2018 and 2022, a clearly political choice where influence struggles and lobbying can lead to technical criteria.
One thing is clear, the 2018 edition of the FIFA competition will be held in Europe, traditional bastion of discipline (four candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal and the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will be much more exotic, since the International Federation hopes to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a premiere on the African continent in 2010, or to continue its implementation in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities included in the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the emir of Qatar, the heads of Belgian and Dutch government, Zidane, Beckham, Crayff) testifies to the economic and political interests at stake in a World Cup.
Transactions between the background, therefore, may last until the last minute.
Furthermore, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy between candidates.
According to FIFA's evaluation report, English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) applications have better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not have too much weight for the 22 members of the Executive Committee when voting.
The Sunday Times, responsible for the revelations that led to the suspension by corruption of two members of the EC (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have ruined the opportunities of his country, the cradle of football, which only welcomed the World once in 1966.
BBC added firewood on Monday by broadcasting a documentary that has brought evidence to three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Enough to disgust FIFA and shame the British officials, who have been launching an intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron at the head.
The Head of Government hopes to re-edit the successful coup by his predecessor, Tony Blair, who had achieved in 2005 for London the JJ.OO. 2012.
This intense activity, will it be enough to regain England's shine before the EC?
It is not clear, since the Spanish-Portugal duo also has many strengths thanks to its stadiums, already ready, its experience (World of 82 in Spain, JJ.OO in Barcelona in 1992, Europe Cup in 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
However, the bleak economic and financial prospects of both countries could put their ambitions down.
The possible reprisals against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal all they get is to give points to Russia, converted into a weight outsider despite the gaps in their candidature (stages, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to move to Zurich and has denounced an "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote", in a direct allusion to the accusations of the English press against the members of the EC.
"They're getting out to brighten their dirty rags, trying to compromise them," Putin said.
By 2022, the United States, having the 1994 experience, seemed to be the most logical favorites.
The first global economic power and headquarters of the main sponsors of FIFA, the country seems to be taking advantage of Japan and South Korea, which have separately developed an excellent project.
However, these new nominations seem premature for two countries that have organised the championship together in 2002.
Another risk: the granting of the 2026 World Cup to China, fervently desired by FIFA, which would cause Asia to run out of possibilities for 2022.
Together with Qatar, which has presented its project based on futuristic stages, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion towards new horizons, but both countries present more risks than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also be adversely affected by the weakness of TV rights paid (depending on the time difference) by European countries, the backbone of the war for FIFA.
Second mandate: evidence
De Gaulle had really doubted.
Mitterrand had made it clear that he doubted.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had no doubt.
And Nicolas Sarkozy less yet.
One mandate in Elisha leads to another.
The current Head of State will therefore be candidate again in 2012.
However, the evidence of this is not well combined with the mystery that is usually associated with the presidential function.
Therefore, it must always appear that you doubt.
To one side and to the other.
In 2006, although they did not believe it, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that he did not rule out a third term.
On November 15, Nicolas Sarkozy said he would make his decision "at some point in the fall of 2011".
Therefore, the fact that you deal with UMP Members, on Tuesday night in Elisha, the possibility of "two mandates" has caused some turmoil.
Is this the official announcement of your application?
Not less.
The president only indicated that the constitutional reform of 2008 limited the number of mandates of five years to two.
It just conveys the facts, not an announcement.
This is not the first time he talks about the presidents, with a jolly tone, in meetings of this kind.
"In the worst, or best, of the cases, you will still spend seven and a half years with me," he had released in July 2009.
On another occasion, in May 2010: "Don't think I won't wonder what will come next."
His claims yesterday do not bring him closer to the candidature, nor do they.
They make comments for two reasons.
Speeding up the career by applying for the PS, on the one hand.
But it is not the fact that Segolène Royal went up to the lecture that led Nicolas Sarkozy to be sincere.
Rather, the fact that their candidacy in 2012 is evident is what leads many PS people to claim that the battle is organized before it is anticipated.
On the other hand, bad polls.
For the first time, right-wing voters prefer François Fillon's candidacy to Nicolas Sarkozy (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and in the UMP there is no discussion on the subject," he responded immediately and prudently to the Prime Minister's environment.
"If you think you can lose, you won't be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always think he can win," says Alain Juppé, resigned to the evidence.
Euro: the ECB is obliged to maintain its acquisitions of State Letters
The last meeting of the Council of Governors of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should enable the modalities for exiting the crisis or at least announce the interruption of a large number of non-conventional monetary policy operations which should end at the end of the year.
As a result of the European sovereign debt crisis, the Frankfurt issuing institute will certainly not be allowed to be so peremptory if it does not want to risk a more than complicated situation in European bond markets today.
The political cost would be equally high.
Yesterday, during a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde supported the ECB's active role in resolving the debt crisis in the European States.
He did not mean whether he felt that the central bank should do more, for example by increasing its programme of purchasing State obligations.
"I reserve my opinion for my fellow Europeans."...
On the eve of Brussels, during its hearing before the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, was no longer more eloquent about his intentions, indicating only that the State Letters purchase programme in the secondary market "continued" and that "we will see what we decided" during the Thursday meeting.
The only thing that is clear is that the ECB is going to keep its main type unchanged at 1%, the lowest level of its history since May 2009.
In practice, the acquisition of Treasury obligations by the ECB has doubled last week until nearly EUR 1,350 million.
Furthermore, according to the indiscreet market operators, it would have bought Irish and Portuguese titles again yesterday.
In total, the Eurosystem central banks have acquired securities of EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt that purchases will follow (see page 29).
Economists do not foresee any significant change of course.
Although lending operations at more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the ECB still makes unlimited liquidity allocations on beneficial terms and with durations ranging from one week to three months.
Economists expect this device to be extended for a few months today.
"I don't imagine he's going to significantly modify his program."
"If not, I would run the risk of creating new short-term tensions," says Michael Schubert, economist of the Commerzbank.
"It seems more likely that there will be a progressive output announced during the first quarter of 2011", anticipates Norbert Bräms, economist in Sal.
Oppenheim.
With regard to interventions on the public debt market, "the ECB should maintain a purchase volume of these obligations to keep the market stable", adds Norbert Bräms.
Taking into account the importance of European banks' exposures to sovereign euro area debt markets, the issuing institute has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It must compensate at any price for the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way that it prevents a marked rise in yields paid by the weaker states," said an important liability manager yesterday.
Because, if interest rates are posed by clouds, States will have even more problems reducing their debt, or even stabilising it.
This is the price of protecting the euro.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government capes the temporal
After Italy started the week in a disturbing way, the situation slightly improved yesterday with the reflux of the types of obligations at 10 years.
A recovery of precarious calm.
At the end of a meeting with the Minister of Economics, the regional presidents stated that they heard Giulio Tremonti classify the situation as "unspeakable" and that a "unforeseen" weekend was expected, statements subsequently denied by the person concerned.
In any event, on Tuesday, the difference with the German long-term rates had reached the record figure of 210 basis points and the price of the credit protection contracts against the risk of bankruptcy (CRQ) had been fired up to 263 points, causing a certain riot in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi commented that, in Spain, the difference with German types was greater than 400 basic points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, was "deeply concerned" about "the turbulence in the markets" and possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy in the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it's like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
In fact, its problem is the lack of growth and the stagnation of income associated with it, which causes the State to run the risk of not being able to meet its financing needs.
The latest forecasts in Brussels have resulted in a cold water jar for the government.
It is estimated that Italian growth will reach 1.1 per cent in 2011 and 1.4 per cent in 2012, while the budget being examined in the Senate is based on figures of 1.3 per cent and 2 per cent, respectively.
Under these conditions, according to the European Commission, the government deficit will represent 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to 3.9% expected by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
That is why there is a rumor that new budgetary provisions can be applied after the parties, for a sum of EUR 7 billion.
"Where necessary, new austerity measures should be taken," says Commissioner Olli Rehn.
For the moment, Italy has the support of international institutions.
"The foundations of your economy are in order and your accounts are in good condition, as we have been saying for a long time," says Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund responsible for Italy in the IMF.
"There is no immediate problem, either in the short or long term, because despite its considerable debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts requested from Italy are smaller than those requested from other countries," says Pier Carlo Padian, OECD chief economist.
The problem of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the Chamber of Deputies, after which the elections could be anticipated at the end of March.
In such a case, a period would not be conducive to decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on strengthening mechanisms to combat the crisis
Christine Lagarde has already repeated this yesterday during a press conference in Paris: "I believe we have already demonstrated on Sunday, night and day that Europeans are clearly solidarity, determined, committed to defending their currency and their monetary zone."
Although it was relative, the relaxation recorded yesterday in the types of European State obligations has driven governments and the ECB.
However, we cannot yet talk about a principle of normalization.
The Standard & Poor's rating agency announced that it could lower the rating of Portugal's debt, the most frequent target today of speculation.
"As in May, political clarity and transparency are really lacking, which weighs significantly on banking systems," said Exane BNP Paribas economists.
Especially because "political rhythm is much slower than the pace of markets".
Aware of this scourge and the dangers it conceals, European countries are intensifying debates to strengthen the mechanisms for exiting the existing crisis.
Informal consultations among finance ministers who are most directly affected and generally with their G-20 counterparts are on the right track.
And this also takes into account the meetings of the Eurogroup and the Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB meets today.
On the agenda, the type of non-conventional support measures for euro area countries in the market collimator (see above).
With regard to the European Financial Stability Fund (EFF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, has launched an Asia-based tour on Tuesday in Singapore to inform investors in the Far East about the developments of the crisis in Europe.
Although the objective of these visits is not to raise funds, it is no doubt to prepare the ground.
The first EFF securities emissions are expected to take place next month.
Yesterday, an official U.S. representative entrusted Reuters with US support for a potential increase in funds mobilized through an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
As for the countries in the front line, Portugal and Spain, they are preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly in relation to the organization of the labour market.
These reforms are added to austerity measures with a closer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to move on a path different from that followed by Greece and Ireland.
They both want to avoid at all costs seeking international assistance before implementing their own budgetary corrections and deciding on structural reforms that they consider indispensable to increase confidence in a lasting manner.
Finally, the capitalist partners of the European funds pose the options available to accelerate the process of normalising public bond markets.
By way of Paris, on 24 November, Axel Weber was the first to launch the idea that if the EUR 750,000 million mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to take out the portfolio again.
The economists of Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European public debt market, consider that an additional amount of around €100 billion would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of direct liquidity injection.
There is the instrument for this: the European financial stabilisation mechanism, currently endowed with EUR 60 billion.
A council that would undoubtedly be able to examine the European capitals in detail.
Especially if market conditions get worse.
Snow and ice: 24 departments on orange alert
Snowfall continues to cause difficulties in circulation, especially in the secondary network in Britain, and may affect various economic activities.
At present, twenty-four departments are on orange alert due to the risk of snow and ice formation.
Eure, Eure-et-Loire, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne joined the twenty departments that were already on the orange alert, eighteen from Wednesday to noon and two, Dordogne and Gironde, joined the group at night.
According to Metéo France, the heavy snowfalls affect the north of Gironde and Charentes, although it also snows slightly on the island of France.
Snow layers of between 2 and 5 cm, occasionally between 7 and 10 cm, are expected in the departments concerned, and between 1 and 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm, in the Parisian region.
The departments affected are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the regions of Baja Normandía, Isla de France and Lemosín.
Snowfalls are strong enough to cause traffic difficulties and affect some economic activities, alert Weather France.
In the Côtes d'Armor, access to several departmental roads to heavy vehicles of more than 7.5 tonnes has been prohibited, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudeac axes.
According to the gendarmes, circulation in the secondary network of Brittany is complicated, so they recommend that it not be carried out unless necessary and the movement of certain vehicles TER has been prohibited during the day.
During Thursday, school transportation has been banned in Picardia.
No specific measures had been planned on Wednesday night to limit the movement of heavy vehicles.
The prefecture "inscites all drivers to drive with the utmost caution on the roads and to adapt their driving to the situation".
The Civil Aviation Directorate (DGAC) requested airlines to cancel on Thursday 25% of their flights at Roissy Paris airport and 10% in Orly due to the planned snowfalls.
DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Grand Paris Metro: First Financial Drafts
Since the debate on modernising transport on the island of France has reached its high point, it has been raining billions.
At least in the debate.
In particular, we talk about the 23 billion for the Grand Paris subway which must build the Société du Grand Paris.
In order to start this GSP, the State has announced an allocation of EUR 4 billion.
At the theoretical level, this amount will be the amount that will subsequently allow the GSP to obtain market loans to finance a part of its double loop.
Today, at last, we have the first accounts.
The 2010 Amending Finance Act, examined in the National Assembly Finance Commission this morning, contains the arrangements for finding the first part of that money.
There are two ways: the creation of a special equipment tax and the increase in office tax on the island of France.
The first, as we read in article 15 of the text of the bill, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
In addition, it is set in numbers: "The product of this tax is EUR 117 million per year".
The second is a modification of an office tax that already exists "to modernize it, increase its product and allocate such an increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would you get with this method?
Who knows.
There are no figures in the text.
But it's past 4,000 million.
"Tax resources are required to be added to the EUR 4 billion of the allocation of funds to be mobilised by the State and to be granted to the Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses," we can read in the explanatory statement.
The GSP is not surprised by this system.
"From the time income is created (the two taxes, ndlr), we can cover the studies for three years and then receive the 4,000 million later, as we explain."
"It will be recorded in the budget and used according to needs."
The GSP estimates that it will start receiving the 4,000 million in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This device, in which the promised 4,000 million are not on credit, can lead to a slightly lit parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be held on 7 December.
Revenge hackers and diligent spies
The WikiLeaks affair has a double value.
On the one hand, it unveils an apparent scandal, a scandal that seems to be just scandalous in the face of the hypocrisy that governs relations between States, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes on an international scale and foresees a future dominated by regression.
But let's go step by step.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation that each file created by a secret service (independent of the nation to which it belongs) is exclusively made up of press clippings.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual customs only reflect what has been written for months in any newspaper (except those belonging to Berlusconi) and the sinisterly ridiculous profile of Khadafi has long given ideas to cabaret artists to create their sketches.
The rule that secret records should only be formed by news of public knowledge is essential for the dynamics of secret services, not just in this century.
If you visit a bookstore dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that every work repeats (about the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templaries or the Rosacruz) exactly what had been written in the previous works.
This is not just because the authors of occult texts do not want to do unpublished research (or do not know where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who dedicate themselves to the occult not only trust what they already know, which confirms what they have already learned.
This is the mechanism of Dan Brown's success.
The same applies to secret files.
The informant is lazy, just as he is lazy (or has little anxiety) the head of secret services (if he couldn't be, I know, libération editor), who only considers true what he can recognize.
The top secret information about Berlusconi sent by the U.S. Embassy of Rome to the State Department was the same as that published by Newsweek the previous week.
Why, then, have the revelations of these files caused such a stir?
On the one hand, they only say what every cultivated person already knows, that is, the embassies, at least since World War II and since Heads of States can call on the telephone or catch the plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic role and, with the exception of some limited exercises of representation, have become spy centres.
Any viewer who sees research films knows perfectly well, we just pretend that we don't know it by hypocrisy.
In any case, repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy and gives a poor image of American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that a hacker would be able to consult the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world significantly affects the prestige of the State Department.
The scandal therefore affects both the victims and the "venders".
But let us enter into the true nature of what has happened.
Previously, in Orwell's time, all power could be conceived as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy has come true ever since, being able to control every movement thanks to the phone, every transaction made, visited hotel, taken highway, the citizen thus became a complete victim of the eye of power.
But when it is shown, as it now happens, that even the crypts of the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control relationship ceases to be unidirectional and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen (at least the hacker, elected as the avenger of citizens) can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power be endured that can no longer keep its own secrets?
It is true, as Georg Simmel once said, that a true secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge of the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually an empty secret, without secret, since it comes from the public sphere; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks has done, that Hillary Clinton's secrets were empty secrets means to take away all power.
WikiLeaks has done no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but yes, and much, to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound caused to such a powerful power?
It is clear that, in the future, States will no longer be able to put any reserved information on the network, as it would be like publishing it in a poster in the middle of the street.
But it is also clear that, with current technologies, confidential telephone conversations cannot be expected.
Nothing is easier than discovering whether and when a Head of State has travelled by plane and contacted one of the counterparts.
How can they maintain private and confidential relations in the future?
I know perfectly well that, for the moment, my prediction is science fiction and therefore novel, but I imagine government agents moving discreetly in due diligence with uncontrollable itineraries, carrying messages that have been learned from memory or, at most, hiding some data written in the heels of their shoes.
This information is then kept, in a single copy, in locked drawers: in the end, the Watergate spying attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
In the past, I have written that technology is now progressing like a crab, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph has revolutionized communications, the Internet has again created a cable telegraph (telephones).
Video tapes (analogues) had allowed film researchers to study a step-by-step film, moving forward and backwards, discovering all the secrets of assembly, while now CDs (digitals) just allow them to move forward or back from chapter to chapter, i.e. to huge proportions.
With high-speed trains, we can travel from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, with the travels it takes, we need three and a half hours.
Therefore, it is nothing out of the ordinary that politics and communication techniques take us back to horse cars.
One last comment.
In the past, the press was trying to understand what was secretly framed in the embassies.
Currently, it is the embassies who request confidential information from the press.
Climate: France's hats in its funding promises
A year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to examine whether rapidly unlocked funding promises (called fast start or early) have been respected by developed countries.
And the French hats have been unveiled.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries pledged to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union pledged to contribute EUR 7.2 billion in three years and France EUR 1.260 million (i.e. EUR 420 million per year).
During the opening of the COP16, the EU has put on the table its best letters to convince its partners that its commitment to fast start funding is true: a report detailing the measures of its Member States, a press conference, a great complementary event, the distribution of leaflets...
The transparency operation was appreciable and was appreciated for what really was worth: developing countries and civil society wanted all developed countries to do the same and with the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released 2010 €2.2 billion, which puts it on the right path towards fulfilling its commitment of €7.2 billion in 2012.
But, if we look at the situation in detail, things are more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Agreement, money must be "new and additional" to ensure that a complementary effort is made, without prejudice to official development aid.
Unfortunately, an agreement has not been reached on what "new and additional" means.
When the European Commission proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
At present, each one chooses the best reference.
For example, the European Commission has taken as a reference the year 2009: international funding is maintained and 150 million is added in three years for fast start financing.
Other countries have chosen similar references for the year or level of official development assistance.
On the contrary, France considers that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, no reference is made to the expenditure of previous years or to the total level of official development assistance.
In particular, the total amount of aid from France to developing countries may remain stable (or even decrease), while seeking to respect its commitment to "new and additional" funds...
Another crucial element, the division between donations and loans.
Once again, there is no rule and each one chooses the method of calculation.
Some, like France, consider that each euro provided amounts to one euro donated.
Obviously, such a thing is difficult to justify: effort is not comparable.
Although the use of loans may be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often projects related to the reduction of emissions based on more effective technologies), it is important to present a euro that will be recovered as equivalent to a euro that is donated... At the most, only the cost of the loan should be calculated for its commitments for the country granting the loan (i.e. the equivalent to an interest rate).
But France does not find such reasoning useful: "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by making 91.5% loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% donations (36.1 million euros); consult the EU document to see it in its own eyes.
This is the only country in the Union which so frequently uses the loan.
Germany uses it by 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia, among others, respect its commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the majority of the European Union provides a euro to fulfil its commitment, France only provides ten cents and considers the effort to be comparable.
Good trick!
In short, in its fast start financing, France makes a double abuse: on the one hand, in relation to actions over time and, on the other, in relation to the real financial effort.
Spending only EUR 36.1 million, it manages to give the impression that it spends 420 million "new and additional", as promised.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that it is Bercy who has taken care of arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why were the other Member States still giving when they can just lend?) and in the negotiations, since developing countries are not foolish...
The chapter on early financing is a detail, relatively short-term, in relation to the whole of climate negotiations.
But it could be an extra grain of sand in the huge machinery that is the UNFCCC.
Let's hope it doesn't.
Whatever it is, it is essential to learn early funding from this first year.
Firstly, France could announce a change in its calculation method for the years 2011 and 2012, with the intention of respecting its commitments and in the same way as the other countries of the European Union.
But, in particular, France could move forward discussions on the stakes in relation to long-term financing (another essential chapter currently under discussion): we will not get rid of the question of the "additional character" or the method of calculating loans.
France could change its position to become as progressive on this issue as it is with others.
We therefore have the hope of the new Minister of Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancún next week.
A surprise announcement on France's fast start and its vision of the "additional character" and the use of loans would help improve the level of international confidence needed to advance negotiations.
Warning on Pesticides Ingested by Children
A 10-year-old child takes on one day 81 different chemicals, according to a study published on Wednesday by the Générations Futures association (the old movement for rights and respect for future generations).
The association, which warns that its results "have no significant statistical value taking into account the limited number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem dealt with," acquired in Oise and Paris supermarkets between July and September foods that usually consume a child of about ten years in four meals and a snack a day.
These meals taken as a model, which respect the official recommendations (five parts of fresh fruits and vegetables, three of dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day), as well as the sweets, were examined in laboratories in search of chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other contaminants.
The balance of the plate is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, of which 42 classified as potential or probable carcinogens and five substances classified as safe carcinogens, as well as 37 substances likely to act as endocrine disruptors (PE), according to studies by various institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Although virtually all cases do not exceed the legal limits for each of the chemicals individually, our study clearly shows that consumer exposure to potentially carcinogenic pollutants and/or PE is worrying," the association notes.
For breakfast, butter and tea with milk alone contain more than a dozen potential carcinogenic wastes and three considered as safe carcinogens, as well as about twenty residues that can harm the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, intended as a tentempié for the school, contains traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide prohibited in France.
The same applies to Kenyan green Jews, including food, where the study has detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, Russian fillet, canned tuna and even bread bar or gum were fastened with pesticides and other chemicals.
In the tap water, the analyses discovered the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon shoot was the most "nutrient" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the analysis of the plastic dish used to heat the food in the microwave was not completely clean.
The final risk that these "contaminants cocktails" generate for the consumer "probably underestimates," says the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV), for its part, has proposed "against the gravity of the situation" to apply a moratorium on the use of pesticides to curb "increase in diseases associated with civilization".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) indicated the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 in cereals.
