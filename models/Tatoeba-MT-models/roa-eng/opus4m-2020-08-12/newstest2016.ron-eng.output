UN chief says there are no military solutions in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon states that his response to Russia's military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the conflict that lasts almost five years and more weapons would only exacerbate the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The UN head again called on all parties, including the UN Security Council, to unite and support negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said at a conference on Wednesday that he intends to meet with foreign ministers from five permanent countries present at the Council - Russia, China, England and France - on the margins of the General Assembly ministerial session to discuss Syria.
Ban expressed regret that the divisions in the Council and between the Syrian people and the regional powers "have made this situation unsolved".
Ban asked the five permanent members to show solidarity and unity when they were able to conclude an agreement on Iran's nuclear weapons, thus addressing the crisis in Syria.
8 digits of polls showing that Donald Trump has real chances
Some tried to label him as a "flip-flop" politician.
Others called it a joke.
And others are waiting for the implosion.
But regardless of how some Republicans try to tear Donald Trump out of the top of the polls, it hasn't worked yet.
Ten of the last 11 national surveys have shown that Donald Trump is driving with one percent of two digits and some voices are starting to seriously wonder what this means for the chances of naming the real estate mogul.
Of course, it's still premature.
None of this does say that Trump will win the race for the nominee of the Republicans.
Pundits shows that during the same period of 2011, Rick Perry's advance was taking place in herman Cain's polls, but none of them won in any state in the nomination race.
And the reasons why they would fight hard in general elections are numerous.
But external groups such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and conservative economic group Club for Growth admit Trump's power and start supporting him with money.
Here are a few figures from recent surveys that suggest that real estate mogul is not just a passing thing:
The figures indicating support for Trump have returned to 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a survey conducted by the University of Monmouth showed that only two out of 10 Republicans had a positive opinion about the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, the percentage rose to 40%.
At the beginning of August, it was 52%.
Currently, six out of 10 Republicans have a favorable opinion about Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
These figures are maintained.
A survey conducted last week by Quinnipiac in Iowa concluded that 60% of the republicans in the region have a favourable opinion about Trump.
Two thirds of the GOP voters would be happy if Trump won the race for nomination.
In a survey carried out last week by CNN/ORC, 67% of Republicans said they would be "enthroned" or "thank you" if Trump would win the race for nomination.
Only two out of 10 say they'd be "sick" if Trump won the race for nomination.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% says they would be "enthusiasms" compared to 40% who say the same thing about Trump).
Closer to enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio, with only 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters claim that they would be "unpleasant" or "greedy" if Jeb Bush's favorite wins the race for nomination.
Most Republicans don't think Trump's temper is a problem.
Although Donald Trump was strongly criticized for the insults brought and his bomb style, 52% of Republican voters at the national level believe that the real estate mogul has the right temper to be president, according to the poll carried out on Monday by ABC News/Washington Post.
We have the same figures in Iowa, where 52% of Republicans believe Trump has the right personality to be the leader, according to the survey carried out last week by Quinnipiac.
However, 44% believe that it does not have the personality necessary to act effectively and almost six out of 10 independents state that its temperament has no choice in the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters get used to it.
When I take the attitude of intellectuals, Republican voters consider Trump to be authentic.
According to a survey carried out last week by CNN/ORC, the question of who has the most chance to win the GOP nomination race, four out of 10 said Trump.
The situation changed compared to the end of July, when four out of ten would bet on Jeb Bush.
Full information: In the past, GOP voters did not read the future very well.
In the same period of the last elections, four out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry in the race for nomination, compared to only 28% for Mitt Romney.
But these figures show that most GOP voters consider Trump's campaign plausible.
Even if the Republicans or replicated to another candidate, Trump is still at the forefront of everyone.
Some voices say that the divided situation will probably contribute to Trump's victory, while support against Trump will be divided into more than twelve candidates.
However, a survey conducted in early September by the University of Monmouth shows that, in the hypothetical situation of a collaboration between Trump and most other Republican candidates, almost always Trump will benefit from the majority support.
Trump is 13 points away from Carly Fiorina, 14 points from Marco Rubio, 15 points from Walker, 19 points from Jeb Bush, and finally 33 points from Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
He's almost equal to Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would beat the businessman with 19 points in a hypothetical one-to-one confrontation.
Most of Donald Trump's supporters say they've decided.
A new survey carried out on Tuesday by CBS/NYT shows that more than half of the voters supporting Trump say they do not change their voting option.
Obviously, much can happen in this respect and no one can say that they will ever change their mind.
46% says it leaves the door open the possibility of changing its option.
However, Trump's most important opponent is currently the neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but it is twice as likely that voters who declare that they have decided to vote with Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "violators" in the opening speech of his campaign two months ago, immigration was the central subject in the 2016 campaign.
Some are concerned that Trump's bomb style will lead to a split between important Hispanic voters and the Republican Party and will harm rebranding efforts.
However, according to the survey carried out on Monday by ABC/Post, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
So it seems that as long as the immigration problem remains in the spotlight, so will Doland Trump.
Frustration against authorities reaches new peaks.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now supported by nearly half of Republican voters, largely due to their status as outsiders.
According to the survey conducted on Monday by ABC/Post, six out of 10 Republicans say they prefer a political outsider to the detriment of someone experienced in government.
People are also angry at the authorities in Washington.
A survey carried out two weeks ago in Iowa by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg shows that three out of four republicans in Iowa are frustrated by the performance of the republicans in Congres, 54% declaring themselves "unpleasant" and 21% "fatty nerves".
Jeremy Corbyn makes his debut at Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn's debut at PMQs has been long awaited
The new leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, will later make his debut at Prime Minister's Questions, confronting David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will address the first of the six questions he is entitled to shortly after lunch; his performance will probably be closely analyzed by the media and Labour MPs.
In weekly appearances, he asked for “less theatre and more facts”.
He also said that he could give up a few participations and give up his colleagues.
The confrontation will be Mr. Corbyn's first parliamentary test in leadership position, coming after he called a "ghost cabinet" and after his speech on Tuesday at the TUC annual congress.
In the meantime, the Labour Party leader's decision to remain silent when the national anthem was delivered in a job held on Tuesday on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of England drew criticism from conservative parliamentarians and kept the front page of the newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem drew attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said that he "kept silence respectfully" and recognized "the heroism of the British Air Forces in the Battle of England."
But a member of the ghost cabinet of Mr. Corbyn, Owen Smith, said for the two's newsnight broadcast by the BBC that he would have recommended to the Labour leader to sing the national anthem "indifferent" from his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Around twelve ministers in the ghost cabinet refused to be part of Mr. Corbyn's lead team, arguing by differing views on the economy, defence and external, while less than one sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as a leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says that the policy differences "cumulate" in the Labour Party after Mr Corbyn's appointment on his position with regard to the European Union and the benefit limit.
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference that the Labour Party would make changes that would completely eliminate the idea of limitation.
A few hours later, Mr Smith, Minister of Labour and Pensions, said that the party "is very clear" in the exclusive opposition to government plans to reduce the "head" level from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader confronted by David Cameron at the rostrum in the last decade, since he took over the leadership of the Conservative Party.
The Labour Leader, who promised a different approach to politics, says he has ideas "from external sources" for questions to be addressed to Lord Cameron and has received over 30,000 suggestions.
Parliamentarian Islington North said that PMQs involves a level of confrontation too high and that it will refrain from retaliation and attacks, committing itself to focus instead on serious problems such as poverty, inequality and challenges faced by young people.
Mr. Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, Finance Minister, would take his place at PMQs when he could not participate - for example when Mr. Cameron moved abroad.
He also expressed the idea that he would allow other colleagues to take the occasional word, saying that he approached the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, John Bercow, to discuss this issue.
In 2005, when he took the lead, Mr. Cameron said he wished to give up the political style "Punch and Judy" associated with PMQs often but admitted a few years later that he failed in his pursuit.
Since the first transmission in 1990, PMQs has been considered a key barometer of the reasoning of a leader, the way he leads the Chamber of Deputies and its position among his fellow Members, although critics say it has become a cartoon and that he needs a profound reform.
‘Frame in Joburg’: Youth without shelter benefit from photo courses
It's hard to be homeless in Johannesburg.
But a group of people who lived on the streets in childhood found a way to learn a job and earn their living.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless youths to take photographs of the areas where they live and earn money from it.
BBC News met one of the first graduates of the project.
Chief JD Sports says that higher wages could damage enlargement
President JD Sports, Peter Cowgill, said that a minimum wage increase in Britain could mean "a greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers."
However, it is unlikely that that purchasing power will exceed the higher labour costs in the company, he says.
Costs could have an impact on JD Sports' expansion plans, he added, which could mean less new jobs.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by President Tennis Australia, Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis should be praised and not criticized for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was a collateral victim in the storm created around his friend Nick Kyrgios, and his behavior deserves more than words of praise and not criticism, in the opinion of President Tennis Australia, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the youngest part of the talented duo often called "Special Ks," was dragged unharmably into the light of the reflectors by the scandalous startup that Kyrgios had in front of Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters Tournament.
In a crescent qualifying game played shortly after, in Cincinnati, the referee had to intervene twice to separate Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison, after which Harrison said: "Wawrinka should have put Kyrgios down, and I should have put this kid down."
Although he was last seen making a powder rocket after having had muscle cramps and missed a possible US Open tournament, angry at Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was firmly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, where he fights with Sam Groth for second place in the individual, after Bernard Tomic in the semifinal Davis Cup against England.
"One thing I feel strong is that, in my opinion, Thanasi was attracted a little to conflict," Healy said.
The truth is that he broke a missile when he lost because he accused cramps in the US, but he's not the first player to break a missile out of frustration with himself and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he wouldn't be proud of it.
But to be serious, he has mastered himself extremely well in rather challenging situations in the US with Harrison and so on and I think he deserves a lot of confidence.
He's got an amazing team, he's got a great family next door, and I think he's been treated unjustly.
He is a very mature 19-year-old young man, works hard and has joined the team, had no conflict with other players, is highly respected in the dressing room, is trained hard, is in an excellent form, is a very balanced and mature young man and I think he deserves to be judged solely on the basis of his qualities and faults.
Healy also supported the decision not to take Kyrgios into account for the important remission match, which starts on Friday, and described the "common decision" as the most suitable for all, but supported the return of the long-term player from Canberra to the team.
“First of all, we want the team to focus entirely on the fight and not think at all about the controversy around [Kyrgios],” Healy said.
And I think Nick went up very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray said, he's growing up under the eyes of the public and he's made some terrible mistakes and he deserves to be criticized, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I think he needs a time when he's not at the centre of attention to be able to reflect, which is good for both the team and for him.
2016 Elections: Hillary Clinton's advantage in front of Bernie Sanders has halved in national polls
The former Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, continues to have a two-digit advantage in the democratic race for national candidacy, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins land.
Clinton is now supported by 47% of democratic voters (down from 58%), while Sanders is second, 27% (up from 17%).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not announced yet that he will run for the presidency, is supported by 15% of democratic voters.
At least five months before the start of the primary elections, most democratic voters say it is too early to say that they have decided on the candidate they will support.
Yet Clinton’s supporters are firmer in their choice than other candidates.
Faced with the CBS news poll last month, Clinton lost ground in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders won a few percent.
Clinton retains the advantage among women and moderators, but the advantage has declined.
Support among men has decreased considerably and Sanders is only 5 points away.
Clinton's advantage among democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated, being now equal to Sanders.
Yet Clinton is still in the vantage point among senior voters.
Last month, Clinton stood in front of Sanders, with a percentage of two figures, among the liberals, but Sanders now has a slight advantage of 5 points in this group.
About half of the democratic voters at the national level say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she was chosen to run on behalf of the party.
A quarter would support it somewhat reserved and another 15% would support it just because it represents the party.
Six percent wouldn't support it.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the likelihood that Clinton's current supporters will be excited about her choice is high.
Opinions are more mixed among those who don't currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would support her with enthusiasm.
While 48% of democratic voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, the number of Republican voters who say the same thing about first class, Donald Trump (35%) is smaller.
When Clinton's supporters are asked an open question about why they would like her to win the race, the majority answer is that she has the right experience (16%), followed by the fact that the time has come for a woman to be president (13%) and that she is the best candidate for this function (10%).
Clinton's supporters also mention her association with Bill Clinton (9%).
The agreement on these issues and eligibility is also mentioned.
In view of the fact that the Vice-President considers a possible candidacy for the presidency, 57% of the democratic voters would like to see him in the race - although a third of them do not think they should run.
On the second option question for the party's representative, democratic voters call Biden majority.
Among Clinton's supporters, more than half claims that Biden would be the second option, long before Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton's advantage in front of Sanders increases from 20 points with Biden running to 30 points if he does not run.
55% of democratic voters consider Clinton the most likely candidate to win the general election; but the figures dropped from 78% last month.
Biden is away from second place, but the percentage according to which he is most eligible has increased.
However, when asked what is most important to a chosen candidate, democratic voters prefer problems instead of eligibility.
Like last month, no democratic candidate or potential candidate is considered by these voters to be unacceptable as party representative in the presidential race.
Democrat candidates or potential candidates do well with regard to some key features vis-à-vis their party's primary voters.
Most voters consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be integrity and trust and strong leadership qualities.
Biden is best seen among all three as regards integrity, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
30% of democratic voters do not believe that H. Clinton is integrity and reliable, twice as many as those who declare this about Sanders (15%), but 27% do not have an opinion about him in this respect.
Democrat voters also generally believe that the three Clinton, Sanders and Biden have the same ideologies as they do.
With regard to all these aspects, about a quarter of democratic voters do not have an opinion on Sanders.
As questions persist regarding the use of a personal email address and a server by Hillary Clinton while he was Secretary of State, most democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation of the subject and say that it did not affect their general opinion against the candidate.
But things are different among the American public.
Half of Americans are now unhappy with her explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
The public opinion was shared in March on this subject shortly after the issue came to light.
Most Americans say that this email controversy has not affected their general opinion about Clinton, although 36% say they have changed their opinion negatively.
In particular, Republicans, more than six out of ten say they have changed their view of Clinton in a negative sense.
Although democratic voters consider Clinton to be integral and reliable, this aspect continues to raise problems among voters at the general level: only 32% consider her to be integrated and trusted, with 8% less than last month and 15% less than in May.
62% of the voters do not consider it to be integrity and reliable.
At the same time, 55% of voters at the national level do not consider Trump to be sound and trustworthy.
Yet both Clinton and Trump have white balls for leadership.
Of the six candidates evaluated, Biden, Carson and Bush are ranked first with regard to integrity.
The number of those who consider Sanders integrity is greater than those who are not of the same view, but as in Carson's case, many do not have an opinion about him.
The error margin for the sample of 351 primary democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Five members of the fraternity charged for the murder of the student in year 1 of Baruch's Faculty
Almost two years after a college student lost his life during a initiation ritual in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, five people were charged with murder.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity of the New York Baruch College brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during an initiation ritual in September 2013 and delayed him to the hospital, which contributed to his death, according to police statements.
Official sources say that the victim was tied to the eye, put a 14 kg bag full of sand in his back and was slammed repeatedly while trying to head towards a target, on a frozen field.
Mr. Deng accused headaches after losing consciousness.
Brother Pi Delta Psi didn't call the emergency number after he passed out and pretended he'd waited an hour before taking him to the hospital, police say.
But they found the time to change Deng's clothes, look for his symptoms on Google and contact Andy Meng, the president of the national fraternity, to seek his advice, police chief Chris Wagner told a press conference.
"At this point, members began to hide personal goods and practically put the good of the brother before the good of Michael Deng," Wagner said.
He couldn't be resurrected and died the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng suffered repeated head trauma, trunks and thighs.
"Many families were devastated by fraternal rituals, since 1970 at least one student lost his life every year because of rituals," Douglas Fierberg, the lawyer of Deng's family, said in a statement.
Their brothers and their members must be held accountable and this measure taken by the authorities is important.
The grand jury of Monroe district recommended that the first five members be charged with murder by grade three.
Another thirty-two members of the fraternity, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged for outrage and complicity in murder.
"We want to take responsibility not only for the people involved, but if there is an organization that has authorized the fraternity, official or unofficial, we will also take responsibility," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
The Baruch faculty prohibited the fraternity and the national fraternity withdrew its affiliation with the local representative.
This is what will happen when the Federal Reserve increases the interest rate
The interest rate will increase and the bull market (growing market) will fall, the profitability of bonds will increase and the economy will enter the recession.
That's what we know.
What we don't know is how long it will happen and how long it will last.
In the economy, history provides little indication of time frame..
After the first increase in interest rates, the recession occurred in only 11 months and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates is often, although not always, a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets respond.
This is why US central bank officials have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on the time when interest rates are starting to rise but on the path of normalisation time.
Indeed, in the game there are multiple variables.
However, in the end, players on the market could find that all the turmoil related to interest rate growth has been exaggerated.
"The first increase in the interest rate decided by the Fed after the global financial crisis will be inevitably interpreted by some voices as a sign of the "cheap banana era," said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a note addressed to customers.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to more normal levels but still small to constitute the seismic shock that all seem to be afraid of.
But it cannot be said that there will be no effects.
We continue to present how some sectors of the economy might react, based on historical trends:
Given the situation that the market has faced in recent months, anticipation of growth in the interest rate can for some time volatile.
But at the time of growth, the impact is not so dramatic.
"There seems to be a tendency for capital profitability to stagnate for 12-24 months after the first growth, which may reflect the deficit in monetary policy again," analysts Deutsche Bank said in a recent study on what will happen after the Fed growths.
More precisely, over the past 35 years, the market has increased sharply - by about 14 percent - towards growth of the interest rate, quite invariable in the period of 250 days after (average climb of 2.6 percent) after which it returns to normal after 500 days, with an average return in the last six cycles of 14.4%, according to a recent analysis published on Barron by the Nuveen Asset Management Chief Strategy.
Deutsche said that the impact on shares tends to become pronounced later in the growth cycle of interest rate and benefits begin to decline.
The recession is a reality of economic life but increasing interest rates often contribute to it.
In the present situation, Fed faces conditions that have not existed before and that could accelerate a recession.
Specifically, gross domestic product will approach its historical minimum point for an increase in Fed interest rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, of the 118 interest rate increases since 1950, only twice the nominal GDP was less than 4.5%.
Although in the second quarter of 2015 the value was 3.6%, few expected the situation to persist, the third quarter reaching only 1.5%, according to Atlanta Fed.
Growing interest rate in such a fragile economy could be risky and could raise the question "if this time is different," Deutsche said.
The players on the market have been prepared all year round for a Fed growth decision, all eyes being targeted for this week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Commission, which ends Thursday.
Although many strategies and economists are of the opinion that the WTO could approve an increase in the interest rate at this meeting, future transactions indicate a probability of only 25%.
"In our study since 1950, all growth cycles of interest rate so far have been in a super cycle of profit growth, GDP eclipsed the peaks before the recession very quickly after the start of recovery," the report said.
On the contrary, this was a strange recovery of slow after the worst recession in the period under review.
The current cycle is by far the longest expected by Fed since the end of the last recession; the record had been 35 months, and it reached 74 months and continues.
Fixed income was also volatile given that the market anticipates an increase in the interest rate and the pattern is somewhat similar to that of dividends.
The main difference is that the impact is faster in the case of obligations than in the case of actions when Fed changes policy.
In the case of bonds, the benefits appear to change direction as soon as the first growth/decrease occurs.
At the end of the growth cycle of the interest rate, the profitability of bonds immediately falls," Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab’s strategies are of the opinion that these growths in the interest rate will lead to the approximation of profitability between short-term and long-term bonds, flattening the curve.
High-efficiency obligations are best handled in such an environment, although "we are still cautious about the strengthening of profitability," said Kathy Jones, income analyst at Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones believes that markets have already adapted to Fed's expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decrease in inflation estimated, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the perspective of a more rigorous monetary policy," Jones wrote.
Short-term interest rates have increased, the return curve is fairer, the spread of the average interest rate has expanded and volatility has increased - all market features when Fed embraces policy.
In large lines, companies carrying out their majority activity in the United States will have to gain from the growth of the interest rate and local products will become more attractive.
Multinationals with large debts will suffer because the increase of the dollar will lead to the purchase of their products in the global market area and their debt will be more expensive.
"History shows that "quality" stocks tend to be more profitable in the next three months following an initial growth in the interest rate," analyst Goldman Sachs said in a customer report.
Strong balance sheets exceeded those with a weak balance sheet after each of the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004, with an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with large capital gains as well as low volatility stocks have also exceeded similar companies with lower quality, with an average of 4 (percentual points) and 3 (percentual points).
Debt will become an important problem.
Companies with a high percentage of floating debt have the most to lose, Goldman says.
Consumers will also have earned from the increase of the dollar.
Those who save could also have won, although experts do not agree on how quickly this will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy after Classic FM, says parliamentary man Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticized the radio station because it "protests"
It claims that it is increasingly similar to the commercial opponent
He also took the BBC Music Awards, claiming they had the Brits prizes.
Damien Collins' colleague attacked The Voice, claiming that neither this show was original
BBC Radio 3 "transformes into" Classic FM, said an important parliamentarian, putting pressure on the post to prove that he does something that commercial posts do not do.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC leaders that the public radio station "protests" and looks more and more like the commercial opponent.
"I feel Radio 3 is "protest" - although I don't like to use the word - but I feel like it's turning into the Classic FM," he said.
He also took a look at BBC Music Awards, launched last year in December.
BBC Music Awards, released last year, seem to be Brits under another name.
So, if you're trying to do something different - these are the two examples that come to mind that do nothing but copy what already exists on the market," said Mr. Bingham.
The BBC Director General denied the charges, claiming that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial opponent in the field of live music and public education.
I'm not gonna find out anywhere about the classical music I'm reading from Radio 3.
And his commitment to live music and production has no rival.
"In addition, I think it is also important that Radio 3 is committed to discover new music and the allocation of new songs," he said.
In the first part of this year, BBC Radio 3, Alan Davey, said that he needs to make more efforts to attract the audience from the previous period because the British have less knowledge about classical music.
But Radio 3 was not the only element under the symbol BBC criticised at the meeting of the Committee on Culture, Media and Sport because it would go after its commercial rivals.
Conservative MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the talent show purchased by BBC from Dutch producer Talpa Media for about £22 million.
Do you understand why there are often discussions about that issue because it is not original and is not distinguished by anything?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - having Paloma Faith and Boy George in the jury - be performed "in a specific way BBC."
He added that he wishes that the Corporation “to find the golden egg chicken in its own way” the next time it launches a entertainment show.
However, he refused to ban future takeover of new sessions in The Voice or spend the money that goes on licenses on other forms of entertainment.
Internet sales recorded the smallest growth in August and guilty could be Black Friday
In the first three months of 2015, online sales increased by 7%.
During the last month, there has been the slowest growth from 2000 to the present.
Online sales advanced three years ago, thanks to the use of the mobile phone to make purchases.
Specialists are of the opinion that Black Friday in November could lead to reluctance to spend.
For over a decade, online shopping has exploded and turned Britain's commercial streets into ghost cities.
Experts say, however, that there are signs that online sales are shrinking, the last figures indicating a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total money spent in August showed the lowest increase from 2000 to now, with only 5% increase in the past year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are shrinking, the last figures indicating a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
"If we analyze the level of growth in previous years and return until 2000, there has always been a tendency to rationalize in time," said Andy Mulcahy, editor at the IMRG sales index for Guardian.
He explained that online sales advanced three years ago, when buyers began using their mobile phone to make purchases.
Thus, it increased the number of people who could shop online and could do it in different circumstances, such as on the couch.
But now that it's stagnant a little, you might notice a decrease (increasing).
The Black Friday phenomenon, imported from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for the decline in sales.
In the opinion of experts, buyers would refrain from making purchases before the event taking place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers leaned in front of computers to put their hands on offers, which led to the collapse of several retailers.
Specialists are of the opinion that Black Friday, when buyers have fought on chilipires, could determine the reluctance of buyers.
A study published by the British Retail Consortium determined that at least £1 out of every £5 is spent online.
In the case of certain products, such as TVs and washing machines, more than a third of the purchases are currently being made through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people prefer to buy clothes and shoes online than to call fashion stores in commercial areas.
After the Bin Laden family was punished, Muslims buried the victims killed following the crash of the macarale in Mecca
The bodies of 29 of those who lost their lives were taken to the streets of Muslims, the first funerals taking place in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia partially blamed the giant in Saudi Binladin Group for the collapse.
The Minister of Health said that a total of 394 people were injured following the crash of the crane
During the street walk ceremony, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims killed because of a macarale collapsed at the Great Mosque in Mecca.
Dressed in white, the mourners joined the road to express their condolences, until the first death reached the end of the final journey at the Al-Moisem cemetery.
The sad reminder preserved by the holy place, where only a few days ago a macara of construction collapsed through the ceiling of the mosque, falling on the believers.
The bodies were released for funerals after the King of Saudi Arabia sanctioned the Bin Laden family's construction group for disaster, which also soldiered with 394 wounded.
At the ceremony on the street, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims killed because of a macarale collapsed at the Great Mosque in Mecca.
Among the victims was the father of four children, Qasim Akram, from Bolton, Great Manchester, in his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Mr Akram was in the Great Mosque with his parents before the start of the annual hajj pilgrimage.
Saudi authorities have already promised that the hajj pilgrimage to Mecca will continue, thousands of pilgrims still arriving in the city.
Today, King Salman said that the Binladin Group should not have left the arm of the crane raised when the crane was not in operation.
An Arabic version of the decree, published by the Saudi Press Agency, said that the Binladin Group bears partial blame for the collapse.
The English news agency service did not present the details, but stated that the company's leaders were banned from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman swore to reveal what caused the crash of the crane in the courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims came before the Hajj pilgrimage that took place later this month.
The Binladin Group has not yet made statements about the collapse of the crane and the representatives of the Group could not be contacted for the declarations.
The Royal Decree blamed the group for not using updated safety measures and did not coordinate its activity with the weather authorities.
Tens of cranes surround the Great Mosque in Mecca, as part of the massive construction effort led by the Binladin Group.
For several decades, the Binladin family has had a close relationship with the royal family of Saudi Arabia and is conducting major construction projects.
The last leader of Al Qaida, Osama bin Laden, was a "renegade" son, disorganized by the family in the 1990s.
The collapse occurred in strong wind and rain conditions, just a few days before the arrival of millions of people in the kingdom to participate in pilgrimage, essential journey at least once in each Muslim's life fit physical.
The authorities state that 158 people remain in the hospital.
The authorities decided that the relatives of the deceased would receive a million Saudi Riali (174,000 pounds) and that the same amount would be paid to those with permanent injuries.
Other wounded will receive half of this amount.
Benefits and disadvantages of converting loans into Swiss francs
In the banking market, there have already been two bids for conversion into lei of loans into Swiss francs, with the main advantages being the exclusion of currency risk and the reduction of rates.
Disadvantages can come in a few years when the interest variable can lead to higher rates.
The Transylvania Bank has just completed the process of converting credits into francs granted by Volksbank, and Bancpost announced a conversion offer for its own customers.
According to the data compiled by analysts of the FinZoom financial portal, Bancpost offers three years of fixed interest to lei, 1.5%, the smallest on the market.
On the other hand, the Transylvania Bank conversion offer was accepted by 83% of customers with credits in francs due to the second successive reductions: the balance with the value of the risk commissions and customer-paid administration was reduced, then an additional reduction of 22.5% was applied to the lei balance.
Both offers reduce the rates of their own customers, compared to the monthly payment equivalent in lei before conversion.
Thus, Banca Transylvania reduces the rate by 42.5%, and Bancpost by 33% in the first three years and theoretically by 18% in the following years.
Benefits
The main advantage of the cover in lei of credits in CHF is that the currency risk is eliminated, the consumer being protected by future franc growth, and the repayment of the credit will be made in the currency in which the wage is charged.
Another major advantage of both conversion offers is that the property is not re-evaluated, additional guarantees are no longer required and another proof of income.
Practically, no new financial and legal analysis of the credit will be made and no additional costs will be incurred as in the case of a refinery.
Both banks also offer a reduction in the monthly rate, compared to what customers paid before conversion, equivalent to lei.
Risks
The problem is that the rate in the first few years is made up more of interest, and the customer repays very little of the main.
The bankpost offer with very small interest in the first three years seems advantageous to customers.
But it is not known how this interest will evolve after three years.
The margin offered to customers can be higher than 3.25%, so overall, and the cost reduction is smaller.
A possible risk for all credit in lei with variable interest is that ROBOR indices will increase significantly in the following years (more than Libor - CHF).
For example ROBOR three months ago is 1.44%, but in 2013 it reached 6% in 2009, over 15%, and in a few days since 2008 it exceeded 40%!
In addition, it is possible to provide other costs, not mentioned in the initial offer.
The time has come for decisions on the interest rate for the US Federal Reserve
The world looks at the meeting scheduled in two days, Wednesday and Thursday, when the US Federal Reserve will make the crucial decision whether to increase or not interest rates for the first time after about a decade.
In a survey carried out by Reuters with the participation of 80 economists, slightly over half that last week believed that the decision would be taken, I now believe that the situation will be maintained for a while and that interest rates will be maintained in the current range of 0-0.25%.
It's a historical event because it's been seven years since the Federal Reserve brought the rates to zero.
For the first time, we face a situation where a major central bank could give up the zero rate and initiate a process of normalisation of interest rates," said Angel Ubide, Chief Analyst at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy has evolved relatively well, recovering by bringing trillions of dollars into the balance sheet and generating a low level of inflation.
However, the Federal Reserve must not ignore the overall situation less pink.
He warned the markets to prepare for growth but there are signs that even they believe such a move is unlikely.
The decision will be announced Tuesday, 20:00 CET.
Sees that have lost their charm
The actor (left), along with his son Redmond (right), has been through stressful situations in recent years.
In 2001 she struggled with leukemia and in 2009 she lost her partner in a life, Farrah Fawcett, in front of cancer.
It is also alleged that the actor would have faced the problem of drug use and was arrested in 2008 for possession of drugs.
All of this is certainly costing.
Player Luke Shaw from Manchester United is on the line for a few months because of double fractures.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture on his right foot in the match played by Manchester United in the Champions League, completed with a defeat in front of PSV Eindhoven.
After the event that brought tears to the player's eye and will keep him on the hook for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains optimistic that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The accident occurred following a reckless intervention by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute, after Shaw, 20 years old, broke the PSV defense.
He received medical care for nine minutes on the ground and needed oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double leg fracture and he's in the hospital."
He'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe tomorrow and then he'll be operated on in Manchester.
It's awful - a boy who came to Manchester United when he was 18, welcomes difficulties, then plays fantastic and now happens something like this.
His oxygen mask was put in the locker room.
She was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but at double fracture the rest is six months and will not play in the group phase.
I hope he can play this season again.
Looks like Moreno got lucky and got rid of the red card and the concession of a punishment shot.
Arbitrary Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian official failed.
You can judge yourself when I say it's fault and red cardboard.
It was a very ugly, two-legged intervention.
A message on Shaw's Twitter account: "Thank you all for messages, I don't have words to express how weak I feel, start my way to recovery, I'll come back stronger."
Similar news: Manchester United hit by Luke Shaw's accident in defeat of PSV
The English team's founder has an additional reason to recover to play at the European Championship in France next year in June.
Phillip Coco, PSV coach, said, "It's a very ugly accident."
Everyone is very sad when a player suffers such an accident.
Our players never seek to accident an opponent.
Moreno broke his leg playing for Mexico's national against the Dutch national led by Van Gaal at the 2014 World Championship.
"It's very hard for him because he didn't intend to hurt his opponent, and when you hear it's a very serious accident, it's not right," Cocu said.
I didn't see the phase.
I couldn't see only the ball, which was heading in another direction, so it seemed that [Moreno] touched it but I couldn't see the intervention on Luke.
In his statement for SBS6, Moreno said: “I know how difficult it is to go through such things.
I feel really bad, I'm so sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado also arrived at the hospital after an intervention by Chris Smalling.
Adam Lyth clearly risked England's omission, but he's still holding fast.
Victoria against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after I have seen the team selected by England for the tournament, I do not consider a 3-0 repetition of defeat in the test games.
I wouldn't eliminate the variant of a victory on the move.
Alastair Cook's team may have less experience than three years ago but has good spin players in the line of beating and collective morality is strong; they will not be marked by the events of 2012 but will have a positive youthful attitude.
Moeen Ali evolves as a spinner and Adil Rashid, although unknown at the test level, is an option for attack.
Similar subjects: Adam Lyth left England's test team and was replaced by Alex Hales
Obviously, as his principal coach in Yorkshire, I find it difficult to analyze the decision not to select Adam Lyth on the team.
He played the seven test games against two good attackers in difficult conditions, and the simple but harsh reality is that cricket players are judged after results.
There were no signs of questions about Joe Root, for example, until the announcements were made because - and I said so before - the players are their own voters.
Some fifty years and perhaps Lyth would have extended his run, but his destiny is in his hands.
I hope that if you run more runs for Yorkshire, you'll have other opportunities.
The senior coach of England's team, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude even when his performance was not to the extent of his capacity and does not surprise me; first of all, he is a teamman.
It's hard to answer the question as long as a batsman is noticed in the test games.
Lyth had seven runs - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton had nine.
Only Compton got lucky home and on the move.
The only dissatisfaction you could have was that England preferred Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean tournament - when Lyth was in full shape - but that missed opportunity is the past.
Alex Hales, a batsman I'm making very good at, is coming on the team.
He's a cricket player who has "factor X" and I noticed early in Yorkshire this season when he scored 236 against us at a Trent Bridge pitch.
It should be given at least the same opportunity as those before it, but this will certainly depend on the composition of the AUE team.
The idea that Moeen would open up next to Cook was launched, which would lead to extra spinner keeping at the same time four quicks, and I have nothing against it.
I don't see why a pitcher couldn't hit there and this left-wing player has already proven he's fucked up.
Maybe Moeen didn't bring success in his district, Worcestershire, but it was number 3 for them, so the difference isn't great.
My old teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 test games as first drop before entering open in 2001.
He immediately erased three centuries and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes on the team back-up spinner and, although I had limited contact with him, struck me that he is a very impressive young man.
People could judge his fragile age - with an average of 31 at the fight and 35 at the ball - and they might think he's a point, but there's not a lot of spinners and the selections opted for the youth.
He'll learn a lot from this tour.
England has made some changes in the coach team.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, a batsman from Sri Lanka, as consultant for the test games could be a master's shot.
He is one of the best players and will bring a lot of experience, as he has played in any situation and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white-ball league of the tournament and will bring both energy and uncivilizing ambition.
I always thought he was born to get involved in international cricket, either as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela, he has intuition.
Sometimes the new voices in the locker, even if they send messages that have been transmitted before, can bring fresh air to the team.
Colly Durham's teammate, Ben Stokes rests for the one-day games, Root has received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with this.
Although they do not all agree, coaches and selections do not make the program.
And you have to retain, players' jobs depend on the results they get.
Such decisions are never taken lightly.
Camp Brexit could have won the cause if the economy remained in accumulative until 2017
Every day, David Cameron's renegotiation strategy to maintain Britain in the EU is getting more and more confused, even without Jeremy's choice "Yes or no?" Corbyn in the leadership of the Labour Party or TUC brings serious criticism Tuesday to Europe.
The foreigners also have characters like Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat explained in the past days that - sunk in crises similar to that in the EU - not all of which are domestically provoked - some Member States are fuelled by the UK's agenda for concessions and treaty amendments, which most of them do not want.
In Brighton, at the annual meeting, TUC decided that they did not want this either if it erodes social protection.
We could even call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
Prime Minister and Chancellor participate in bilateral summits or sessions in foreign capital, take a picture in front of a famous local monument, with or without the local representative, then return home and declare that they have won allies for reform.
It's just about me.
My European friend, who wants Britain with a perspective outside the EU roof - "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - suggests that several ministers and officials obtained from certain capitals have reached the point where they don't care if they stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, the extremely cautious German chancellor, is an ally but she has been in charge for 10 years and wishes to leave the position before her situation goes down, as with Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16), who have been too much.
In 2017, France's President, François Hollande, will be re-elected or replaced.
And his power is in decline.
Poland could soon have a right-wing nationalist government, Spain one left.
It is hard to believe that they will help the English who pose, whose energy would be better used to prevent Scotland from leaving Britain - a thing they do not want either because most have similar separatist tendencies.
Thus, some ministers might even plan to make intentional remarks that do not help, in the SNP style, in the 2017 UK referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, suggests my friend.
‘Renegotiation has been fixed’ and ‘Great Britain has gained nothing of value from the renegotiation’.
Europeans know on their skin how captors Fleet Street can be and how sceptical are barons in the oligarchic press that look at the EU with scepticism, because they did not participate in the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn who ratified our 1973 entry in relation to 2:1.
Perhaps he remembers vaguely by Boris Johnson, the Euro-opportunist, who became famous in the early 1990s when he was a coroner of Brussels.
Ed Miliband knew his enemy.
They included the mixture of tax-depriving bags, foreigners who were phone fraud and pseudo non-domies that own most important newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair sees them somewhat the same, but he realized that when you're locked in a cage next to a nervous gorilla, you have to give him the bananas to distract him from thinking about eating lunch and again at tea.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairite than Blair in opposition to Cameron's idea of referendum, given that Blair made a concession to the abandoned EU constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who offered him an exit card.
The press didn't forgive him for that either.
But Jeremy Corbyn, who touched me friends on the back months at Westminster - I told him not to spend his time with me - seems to be in danger of adopting Neil Kinnock's Murdoch boycott strategy from the '80s, a mistake then and now.
It may last, but it must develop a coherent strategy of cooperation with the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr whose position at the BBC left her on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position with regard to Europe is what I would freely call evolution.
He says he would like us to remain in a reformed EU.
Most of those who disagree with conservative "anglicism" might agree with that.
This said Hilary "A Benn, but not a Bennite" Benn on radio and TV this week, when the researcher in him fought not to acknowledge that the appointment of John McDonnell by Corbyn as Minister "of Shadow" on financial matters was a bad idea.
He reminded me of the 70s, when his father fought on TV to be disloyal to fellow workers, without going too far and without losing his office.
Hilary's fight was more attractive.
But fighting to remain "in any situation" - Benn's expression - does not match what McDonnell said and what JC colleagues and parliamentarians said during the private meeting of Monday night.
Regardless of the image Corbyn wants to convey - hold me back, he also made me aware - the discipline of messages remains important in the era of television and especially in the rotation of social networks, a focus of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right not to give Cameron a ticket of favor in Europe, allowing him to take the support of the workers in the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins definitely believes this.
But McDonnell and Corbien's basic sophistication of EU membership - in line with their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just an esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents for which the narcissism of small differences is a central dogma.
As in the case of his sophistication on NATO - Tom Watson is undisputed that JC will not campaign for resignation - foreign diplomats will be forced to try to understand.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - and there are suspicious voters - for concessions to Britain when everything might be useless?
The US is already quite disappointed about the weak military performance of the English in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a conservative government that cuts costs, as I was reminded of the launch of the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Specialists criticise the decision of the Department of Public Health in England on electronic cigarettes
According to researchers, the claims of a government agency that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting between 12 people, some of them related to tobacco industry.
Specialists from the editorial team of the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the Lancet publication in criticizing the evidence used by the Department of Public Health in England (PHE) in its report on electronic cigarettes.
PHE published the reference report last month and described it as a "complex analysis of the evidence."
However, some researchers doubted the robustness of the data and pointed to links between certain experts and the tobacco industry.
An article published last month in the medical journal Lancet attacked the "extraordinarily fragile base" that PHE founded its main conclusion.
Two other researchers who write in BMJ have raised the question of their claims and their foundation "on solid ground or moving sand".
Martin McKee, European public health professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at Liverpool University, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that policies must be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They said that PHE claims that “current estimates show that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking” are based on a detailed analysis of evidence and models.
In fact, only one meeting involving 12 people led to the development of a multi-criteria decision analysis model (MCDA) to summarise their views on the negative effects associated with various nicotine-containing products; the results of this meeting were briefly presented in a research paper.
McKee and Capewell said that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, about which executive director was said to have received funding from British American Tobacco for conducting an independent study in the past.
It also validated the accreditation of BAT in public health in a report on sustainability, he said.
They added that one of the 12 participants at the meeting said the funding received from an electronic cigarette producer but not the funding that there are reports that they would have received it from the tobacco and tobacco producer Philip Morris International.
No arguments were provided on the basis of which panel members were selected, but these include a number of known "frontiers" in the production of electronic cigarettes, some of which even declare in the industry's financing work.
Other participants in the meeting are not known for expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the head of the tobacco control department in the PHE.
The research work developed by the group "musquemalizes convincingly" that they lack "solid evidence of the harmful effect that most of the products have under most criteria," McKee and Capewell said.
However, the PHE report does not mention any of these links or limitations.
McKee and Capewell stated that PHE claims that "to date there is no evidence that electronic cigarettes are a factor that encourages smoking among children or non-smokers" are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of the PHE health department, said he had responded in the past to the BMJ claims.
He said: “Electronic noises are significantly less harmful than smoking”
One of two people who have been smoking all their lives loses their lives because of this vice.
All the evidence suggests that the risk of electronic cigarettes for health is lower compared, but we need to continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about the information that emerges and those that does not emerge from the evidence, in particular given the high degree of public confusion regarding the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Every year, about 80,000 people lose their lives because of a smoking-related disease and the annual costs of the national health system due to smoking amount to £2 billion.
Making clear the current evidence - i.e., that while the use of electronic cigarettes is not without risks, they only present a fraction of the harmful effect of smoking - we do our national duty.

Ads that shame Britain's arms trade
Follow the film by Amnesty International against the arms trade.
Drone awful killers!
Beast to tear your ankles!
Dispersive bombs!
And electric sticks that cause terrifying pain without leaving traces!
The cheering voice and animated images leave no doubt that this advertisement for the world's largest arms trade is a bright charade, made by Amnesty International to highlight the British authorities' desire to sell arms to repressive regimes through Defense and Security Equipment International at ExCel Centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign has also led to the display of a large number of posters in bus stations and metros that need a second look.
"Important announcement, travel with DLR between 15 and 18 September?" says one of the announcements, using the fonts and branding of the London metro, the DLR line turning into the image of a tank.
In September of this year, a lot of arms dealers will be throwing themselves on the DLR Clients are being asked to contribute to the cessation of the arms trade.
The 300 posters are made by artists who exhibited works at the Cruel Designs Museum in Dismaland, Banksy.
A group called Special Patrol Group has contributed to the distribution in London using "Ad Space Hack Packs", a package of 6 pounds of Allen keys that "facilitates access to about a third of the advertising space in the world's bus stations."
The London transport company is not amused by this vandalism in the form of a steering wheel.
One of the parody announcements produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator Cruel Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are asking more and more questions and seeking to make political works accessible to the public outside the galleries.
Many artists are heading for collaboration with activists in protest movements, realizing that they have to go out into the real world in order for their art to have an impact on society.
Another poster against arms trade that welcomes commuters travelling by subway.
The film made by Amnesty had over 100,000 Facebook views in 24 hours and was created by the VCCP advertising agency that worked pro bono, and the graphic designer and artist who doubled the voice also worked for free.
The creation director of the VCCP, Matt Lever, was shocked by the silence around the ad for the arms trade - with an empty space in the ExCel calendar - and thought "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They played with the creation of a more realistic advertisement, but "enriching it with strong animations and colors, it was more exciting".
"They did a great job helping us increase our interest in the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair," says Tom Davies on behalf of Amnesty.
Now, it would be necessary for the authorities of Britain to take action and ensure that torture equipment is not illegally marketed and delivered to the door.
Perhaps the most creative form of art on the subject of the arms trade comes from inside ExCeL, where exhibitors offer fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab issued an order received from the US Army on "AT4CS RS with shoulder-supported launcher."
It includes "a single-shaped focus that gives amazing effects behind the armor inside the target.
Whatever that means, it won't be nice.
Eight golden rules to live in the home
It's been 11 years since I moved to the house, while I was a 19-year-old who still believed in beers and moral relativity, but I barely remember the loud smiles of those who are annoying - and the many complaints to others.
Most of the things we've learned can be summed up in the form of eight simple rules.
Moving into the home can bring states that vary from nervously falling to horror.
The word is tempting: to tell people where you are from, if and where you spent a year's break from studies, what you think about Corbyn and why "sincerely, you are no matter Marmite because, really, boys, it's nothing but Hahaha drug extract, you find me in my room."
Take a deep breath.
And help others breathe - ask questions and show interest.
These animate the conversation and help you differentiate the people you like from those you wouldn't talk to even if the flood came and they would be the only ones who would have boats.
Don't suffocate people.
Sleepers often abound with drinking parties, movies and social gatherings, but they are also the place where people dress and taste their underwear.

Introverts are part of special treatment at the university.
Your dorm should be a refuge, but in many homes there is a dormitory culture based on friendship, socialization and lifelong friends.
All of this can be terrible for someone trying to load their batteries.
Nothing in this culture allows you to say "I like you and I want you to stay friends but I want you to go away to regain my energy that I've been interacting with you."
Try to sit down when a colleague is exhausted from socialization - and try sending a text instead of knocking on the door.
That's about knocking on the door: do it.
A guy who was sitting in the same house with me had a policy that said if a door wasn't locked, then he was invited in.
He's seen enough things.
Make friends cooking.
Since you start college in Bake-Off fever, if you knock on someone's door to meet someone and take a plate with niggers, it seems less strange, less kind of the situation in the 1950s, "Welcome to the neighborhood, I cooked something, now smiles and I ask personal questions."
Good things prepared in the house are a great way to make you friends.
Your roommates will feel compelled to sit down and may end up associating your figure with a pleasant surprise.
Obviously, you must be a good cook.
Peanuts of flour, sugar and fat will most likely cause others to pretend to sleep when you knock on the door.
Stealing of food is a common offence in student homes.
Obviously, if you blow someone's chicken is stolen, but if you take a drop of milk to put in tea is still stolen?
Ask the owner.
He'll probably tell you to serve even if he's boiling on the inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying and I understand you - still try to address the problem more mature than my roommate, who has colored his milk with liquid detergent to punish those who have stolen.
He's in prison now.
Do not make noise that does not let others sleep or study.
That's not just because it's good sense, it's because you're going on your own.
A girl on the level with me asked her neighbor to give the music slower because it was 3:00 in the morning and she had an exam in the morning.
Their reaction was to give the music stronger.
When they finally stopped the music at 5 a.m., the girl was nice and let her sleep two hours before giving the maximum to the music, locked the door and went to the exam that lasted three hours.
Wouldn't it be romantic if the future husband/visitor wife moved to the same level?
On the contrary, wouldn't it be extremely strange if you'd confuse a level colleague with your future husband, you'd hook up, you'd split up and you should meet each day and maybe even see him catch up with all the common friends?
Of course, you can't resist the heart - but if a sexy peers are certainly not your future husband, at least try to be rational.
The moment you realize that someone left their keys in the locked room, the line between the farce and intimidation is thinner than it seems.
A successful prank is funny, but it can denture in a few moments.
Teach a fun and valuable lesson about safety by hiding something - but never soil someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock the door and put the keys in a glass of water that you put in the freezer - but don't attach the goods to someone's ceiling more than twice.
Violinist David Grimal: There were no world tournaments in Bach's time.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people who worked, artists and not commercial representatives.
French violinist David Grimal is one of the great artists of our times, known not only as a solist but also as the initiator of a less common project, entitled "ciudad", as he himself says, Les Dissonances - an orchestra made up of international soloists and talented musicians, who interprets a symphonic repertoire without having a conductor, and that makes it at least a curiosity in the classical music landscape.
Les Dissonances was this year at the Enescu Festival with two shows: a representation, Sunday, in which the soloist was David Grimal, the founder of the orchestra, and one month, when in the foreground was the violinist Xavier Phillips, the works composed by Enescu were unimpossible.
Both performances, performed on the scene of Athens, showed the audience another way to interpret classical music.
Les Dissonances appeared on the music scene in 2004 being, at that time, the only classical musical ensemble in which there was no conductor.
The conductor is the most important musician for the musicians.
It's true, on the one hand, musicians need an education either to become soloists or to become interpreters in an orchestra - they talk about instrumentalists, and not composers.
They're trained as "specialized workers".
They themselves feel like they need a conductor.
On the other side of the stage, for the public, all the musical fetishing focuses on the conductor.
And so, the business, the music industry, makes its marketing.
So we're not talking about music anymore.
So if we look at this world, we have qualified workers on the one hand, which is stupid, and an audience that can't listen, but you have to look, which is stupid again," considers David Grimal.
The rapist tells us that this change in the way music does came after the "musical disappointments" of his solo career.
I was like a high-level athlete who was supposed to do the same exercise all over the world with different orchestras, to earn a lot of money and bring money and the music industry.
Ten years ago, when I was about 30 years old, I found this very depressing, because I no longer found human creativity and brotherhood in this system.
So I've found no more sense to continue on this road.
So I decided to create Les Dissonances.
This happened in 2004, and at that time no one was doing such a thing without a conductor: "The world of music, extremely conservative, did not want such projects."
"How do I imagine you doing marketing with a collective of musicians in which there is no ego?" asked the artist.
David Grimal acknowledges that Les Dissonaces represents "a luxury", specifying that none of the musicians who are part of the orchestra depends on the success of this project to live.
In 10 years of the existence of the ensemble, the absence of a conductor has not proved to be a stumbling block in the musical act: "In curiously, with the way we sing a more complex repertoire, it seems so simple, because all musicians are obliged to be present in the opera and not just in the role," Grimal maintains, adding that at the Sunday show "we were 74 drivers on the stage".
In Grimal's opinion, the Enescu Festival is a "very brave", just because it invited Les Dissonances: "An extraordinary festival, where are present the world's largest orchestras that sing 3 times a day, and in the middle of these orchestras you invited this strange group."
In a temple of orchestral tradition, such as the Enescu Festival, there is a place and interest for something different, which breaks down barriers.
Speaking of Enescu's work, the violinist acknowledges that he feels the Romanian music of the famous Roman composer, so that he did not need a special approach when he introduced Enescu's works into his repertoire.
Grimal notes that Enescu's music is very instinctive, but this happens when we talk about George Enescu and Romanian music, "because there is also a George Enescu who made French music".
Grimal is fighting for the change in the way classical music education is done, considering that "the work of musician, as it is organized today, has a death row" and that "the future of music represents music itself".
We don't need to tour the world five times a year if it doesn't work.
There were no world tournaments in Bach's time.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were working people, who were artists and not commercial representatives.
For me, the organization of concerts, festivals, tournaments, the release of albums are all great, extraordinary, but as long as they are done in the service of music.
If not, we're in a system where creativity suffers, it's no longer free.
To illustrate this phenomenon, David Grimal gave an example of Roma products before and after accession to the European Union: "Before entering the EU, you had vegetables and good meat."
In order to enter the EU, you had to adopt health laws which are not good for vegetables and meat.
Production and agriculture come to the service of supermarkets, as is also the case in France.
The same thing happens with music, it's the same logic.
Les Dissonances makes the reds may not be very beautiful, but when we cut them they're true reds.
In an ideal world, this music should return to the center and that the institutions and industries that manage this system understand that music does not need to be sold, but needs to be shared, and this can be done by starting with educational policy.
"If we consider - as Koreans do, Chinese, Japanese - that Western music is one of the most beautiful things of humanity, we reintroduce its learning in school, we reintroduce concerts on television and through this education there would be no need to sell music by-products," says Grimal.
Surely, there are things in classical music education that remain very communist, that's everywhere, it's a very militarized thing.
It depends on this discipline if we compare a musician to a soldier, or if we form a musician who will sing to an instrument, being, first of all, a musician.
We're talking about a completely different education, if we want to form a soldier (this education - n.red.) must be in a way, if we want to form a musician, it's completely different.
According to your opinion, what is more dangerous, a soldier or a musician?" asked the French artist smiling.
Grimal shows that for artists, the reward of another kind of music comes just from overcoming this status of "soldier", exceeding what "they think are their limits": "Musicians discover in a certain moment that they are not soldiers, and therefore after the concert they come out smiling".
David Grimal spoke about the project or music and about his vision of music and artist at the "Festival of Ideas", a discussion with the public organized at the International George Enescu Festival at the Aspen Romanian Institute.
David Grimal Profile
After following Conservatoire National Superieur de Musique in Paris under the guidance of Regis Pasquier, the period when he received advice and encouragement from renowned artists such as Schlomo Mintz and Isaac Stern, David Grimal studied for a year at Ecole des Science Politiques in Paris prior to his meeting with Philippe Hirshhorn, who changed his life course.
David Grimal has an international solo violinist career, along which he has held regular concerts over the last 20 years on the main classical music scenes of the world and with prestigious orchestras such as Paris Orchestras, Orchestras Philharmonics of Radio France, Russian National Orchestra, Orchestra National de Lyon, Chamber Orchestra of Europe, Berliner Symphonic, New Japan Philharmonic, Orchestras of the Opera de Lyon, Mozarteum Orchestra Salzburg, Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra and Symphony Warsaw, under the leadership of conductors such as Christof Eschenbach, Michel Plasson, Michael Sch=nwandt, Peter Csaba, Heinrich Schiff, Lawrence Foster, Emmanuel Krivine, Mikhail Pletnev, Rafael Fručhbeck de Burgos and Peter Eotvos, Andris Nelsons, Christian Arming.
He was the recipient of dedicated works by several composers, including Marc-Andre Dalbavie, Brice Pauset, Thierry Escaich, Jean-Francois Zygel, Alexander Gasparov, Victor Kissine, Fuminori Tanada, Richard Dubugnon, Ivan Fedele, Philippe Harrowing, Anders Hillborg, Oscar Bianchi, Guillaume Connesson and Frederic Verrieres.
Along with his solo artist career, David Grimal also wanted to explore more personal projects.
The freedom he offered to collaborate with Les Dissonances allowed him to develop his inner universe through adventure in repertoires that are not accessible to solo artists.
Along with Les Dissonances, he set up "L'Autre Saison", a series of concerts given for the benefit and together with people without shelter at the Saint-Leu Church, located in the heart of Paris.
Beginning in 2008, David Grimal was an artist at the Opera Residence in Dijon.
He teaches violin lessons at the Musikhochschule in Sarrebruck, Germany.
He also held many master's courses and was a member of the International Long-Thibaud Competition jury in Paris in 2010.
He received the distinction of Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres from the French Minister of Culture in 2008.
David Grimal sang on a Stradivarius, "ex Roedier" in 1710, but also on "Don Quixote", a violin designed for him by French fighter Jacques Fustier.
David Grimal was present on Sunday at the George Enescu International Festival this year together with the Les Dissonances Orchestra, in program being Debussy, Enescu and Beethoven.
Les Dissonances also went up on the stage, this time with violinist Xavier Phillips in the foreground, and the program was composed of Schnittke, Enescu and Brahms.
Cinema City is looking for "Small Large Voices"
Cinema City launches the most challenging challenge for children: doubling two characters from the superproduction "Craisa Snow 3D"
Do you have a super-talented and spontaneous child who likes movies?
Offer him the chance to become a star.
In September, under the newest campaigns dedicated to enthusiastic and ambitious children, eager to reach future stars and who are between 8 and 16 years old, Cinema City is looking for "Small Large Voices", giving them the extraordinary opportunity to double two characters from a famous animation film.
If in the classic drawings the focus was placed on approaching the actor's voice of the character-specific animation, in the last period, the creation of the story is taken into account and those who are to interpret the voices, and they are usually very well-known actors.
Cinema City Romania, however, wants to discover new voices and that is why we are launching an unpublished campaign.
We want to find the right voice and challenge parents to register their children for our contest.
They will have a special experience, because the characters are nice and the lines are funny.
"Children will have fun and will have a real chance to be part of a team of actors," said Ioana Ionescu, Marketing Manager of Cinema City Romania.
In the first stage of the competition, between September 11th and September 30th, Cinema City organises a lecture following which 10 children (five girls and five boys) will be chosen to give a test in a recording studio with professionals.
All parents have to do is access small voices platform. kinema-city.ro, where to register the child for the contest and prepare it for the voice test.
Afterwards, you have to choose one of the four films available on the platform, download the texts that the child is about to read and then, the child will register by interpreting his own version of dubbing.
Four films about friendship, fairy tale heroes, magic and hope can choose contestants to support the challenge: "Pene Yellowe 3D", "Mone: Guardian of the 3D Moon", "Blinky Bill: Koala the Phonash 3D" and "Albinuta Maya 3D".
In the end, the two most talented children (a girl and a boy) will see their dream fulfilled and will double a character in the superproduction "The Snow Queen - Craiasa Snow 3D", who will have the premiere in Romania in November of this year.
FedEx winnings are mixed, tax forecasts are low for 2016
FedEx has declared disappointing results for the last quarter, the delivery giant reducing the estimates of profit for the whole year as a result of the low demand for transport services and increased costs for its land transport division.
The company also stated that it intends to hire around 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
In the same period last year, FedEx announced that it will employ 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
The company's shares decreased by approximately 2.5% in the pre-market trading, 45 minutes before the opening bell sound on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said he expected to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending in May next year, with 20 cents less, according to an earlier estimate.
Analysts predicted the figure of $10.84, according to a factset survey.
The decrease is estimated to increase prices by 4.9% on average, with entry into force on 4 January and higher surcharges for the transportation of large or high-weight packages, which will apply from November.
The company said it is still expected to increase gains compared to the previous year as a result of lower costs, higher incomes and the development of online trade.
President and CEO Fred Smith said that "the firm is facing a considerably weaker economic situation than is expected, in particular with regard to global production and trade."
The holiday employment plans were announced one day after the competitor UPS said that he intends to hire 90,000-95,000 additional workers, approximately the same number of commitments he made last year.
In the quarter that ended August 31, FedEx won $692 million, with 6% more than the previous year.
The winnings per share were $2.42, under the average estimate of $2.44 per action made by 12 analysts who responded to the survey carried out by Zacks Investment Research.
The profit grew by 5%, up to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts who participated in the Zacks survey estimated the amount of $12.23 billion.
The FedEx company has been hit in recent years by a decline in international priority transport, leading to the stagnation of revenues recorded by its Express unit.
But the explosion in online shopping has leapt the results of the FedEx Ground division.
In the last quarter, income from the ground division increased by 29%, but operating incomes largely stagnate due to higher costs for large packages and own insurance.
The express unit recorded an increase in revenues due to higher base rates, while revenues recorded by the Freight Division decreased due to rising costs.
At the pre-market trading, about an hour before the opening sound, the FedEx shares had dropped by $3.85 or 2.5% to $150.15.
Tuesday was closed by 11% at year level and by 17% compared to the highest recorded record on 11 June.
At the most anticipated meetings in recent years, policy makers in the Federal Reserve will spend two days this week around a 27-foot Honduran Mahon table to decide whether the time has come to raise a key interest rate for the first time in almost a decade.
Above them, at the end of the central bank meeting room, a mural painting of the United States will appear.
The map is intended to remind you that Janet L. Yellen, President Fed, and his colleagues must put the nation's economic interests above all.
The Central Bank received a double burden from Congress: maximising the employment rate in the US and maintaining price stability.
But since the great economic crisis, the Fed leaders confirmed that there is a third unwritten task: financial stability.
And this third task could be the X factor in a too difficult decision to anticipate, which will be announced Tuesday, and will determine whether the US economy is ready to be relieved of the unprecedented incentive offered by the short-term interest rate almost zero in force since the end of 2008.
Even if most data indicate a strong growth economy, the recent turmoil on global financial markets could scare Fed officials already cautious about adding volatility by increasing the reference rate to federal funds - even with only a quarter of a percentage point.
"Of course, the labour market and inflation will be the first and main aspects to follow," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Nicolaus & Co brokerage firm.
"But I believe that if they are looking for an excuse not to increase the interest rate, growing uncertainty on the world market is sufficient to provide them with arguments to wait further," he said.
There is no consensus as to the decision that Fed will make, in itself causing instability on the financial market.
About half of the recent Bloomberg economists anticipated an increase in the interest rate this week.
However, financial markets expect Fed to delay, a key indicator showing that the growth probability is only 30%.
This would indicate a fall on the stock market if Fed increased the interest rate, unless policy makers would mitigate the blow by promising that it would take a long time to the next increase.
Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial media rose 228.89 points, or 1.4%, up to 16,599.85.
The advance was triggered by expectations that the Fed decision makers will maintain the interest rate stable this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be surprising if Fed increased the interest rate at the moment," Lonski said.
If the Fed decision makers would do so, "they should act in depth in their policies to avoid panic on financial markets".
Other experts said that an increase in interest rate would calm financial markets because it would remove uncertainty related to the time when Fed would act.
Just a month ago, Fed seemed to be about to increase the rate by 0.25% this month, the first small step towards slow deepening monetary conditions that would confirm the force of U.S. recovery.
Yellen said in the spring and early summer that he expected an increase in the interest rate this year despite the high liberal objections that would require further economic progress.
Although job creation slowed down in August, growth in the labour market was strong this year.
The unemployment rate declined to 5.1% last month, the lowest percentage in more than seven years and almost the level considered by Fed as total employment.
Wage gains showed signs of growth.
And although inflation continued to fail to achieve the annual target of the central bank, the decision makers Fed said that one key reason was the temporary effect of declining oil prices.
The economy "may cope with higher rates and need them, given the pressure on the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But global financial markets began to enter the fibrillations at the end of this month, after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell by 16% below the highest record reached in May, as investors feared that slowing down the Chinese economy would lead to global growth.
The market has sort of retreated this month, the Dow index now being about 10% below the maximum in May.
For Fed decision-makers, market unrest is added to the complex calculation of the interest rate growth time.
"Without what has happened in the financial markets and the news of the weakening of the Chinese economy in recent weeks, it would be more firm at the meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, an experienced researcher at the UCLA Zakyn Center for Real Estate and former official Fed.
Now, he expects that they will wait at least a month to better manage the effects.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact will be on the US economy and there are almost no data to rely on later events in China," Oliner said.
The well-being of the global economy is not one of the main interests of the Fed, so it should practically not be taken into account in making decisions.
But, in reality, Fed has become the world's monetary authority.
In recent years, the influence of the central bank has been enormous.
The President's simple allusion since then, Ben S. Bernanke, in 2013, that Fed could " narrow" his monetary expansion triggered an earthquake on global markets.
In a world where markets and economies are becoming increasingly crowded, it is expected that Fed officials not only will monitor progress in other areas but will also consult with other central banks and experts to better interpret the world economy.
Its decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the Global Strategy Department within the Investnet Welfare Management Company Inc.
Jeffrey Laker, Federal President Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., said this month that "Fed has a history of oversized reaction to changes in the financial market that seem unrelated to economic bases."
Lacker, a member with the right to vote of the Federal Open Market Commission, a decision-making body that supported the growth of the interest rate, offered as an example the 1998-99 decisions.
A financial crisis that has affected Asia has led Fed to reduce the reference rate by 0.75% by three meetings, "in spite of the implications with limited identification for US development," Lacker said.
A year later, the Fed officers returned to these casualties.
Fed should put the issue of financial stability first only in the event of a major crisis, as was the 2008 market earthquake, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England interest rate determination committee.
The last troubled period does not rise far at that level, he said.
"We certainly do not want to get into the situation of fear of an increase in the interest rate because the markets have been upset," said President Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still holds the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until something is changed in this respect, I do not think that it should take premature action.

Seven's Sunrise dominates the polls, despite the attempts of the Nine Channel to broadcast in Today Show about changing party leadership
The urgent movement of Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to convey on the subject the consequences of changes from the leadership of the liberal party did not bring a significant increase in the audience for Today.
The Nine Channel's morning show sent from the capital after Tony Abbott's defeat in front of Malcolm Turnbull.
The competition show Sunrise, moderated by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was caught in London as part of a series of broadcasts carried out over several weeks, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This "cross" distance did not seem to matter too much for viewers Aussie TV, Sunrise having an audience of 397,000 viewers in the five capital cities, compared to Today with 339,000.
Today there was a slight increase compared to Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000) but the figures were smaller than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has reduced the difference from Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today had an average audience of 318,000 and Sunrise had 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference varies between 40,000 and 50,000.
As of September, Sunrise has an average audience of 349,000 viewers and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that has happened all morning.
This morning, not only is Parliament affected by the current change!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!

The main news was the startling debut of the 800 Words series with the former star from Packed to the Rafters, Erik Thomson.
The new drama, having as its subject a recently widowed father who decided to move along with his two children on New Zealand's coast, had a very impressive average audience of 1,219 million viewers.
Critics wondered if Thomson was able to face a show alone without the Rafters star, Rebecca Gibney.
The results of the hearing last night responded sharply that "yes".
Show X Factor transmitted by Seven remained in position, with 1,136 million viewers, taking easy the face of The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,6,000).
Seven recorded Swiss and descent on the second night of the broadcast of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17:00 to 17:30) of the new moderate general culture show by Andrew O'Keefe had an average of 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (17:30 to 18:00) went up to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small victory in front of Eddie McGuire's show, Hot Seat (613,000).
Monday night, the first half hour of The Chase Australia had an average audience of 520,000 viewers and the second half recorded a huge figure of 720,000.
Hot Seat had an average audience of 620,000.
The fall in the hearing recorded by Chase Australia on the second night will give silent confidence to Nine that Hot Seat will eventually triumph at 17:30.
The Chase Australia replaces Million Dollar Minute, a show that failed to win McGuire's show.

Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet to discuss the rights of homosexuals
In 2003, Mihail Hodorkovski, the richest man in Russia, was arrested under gun threat at an airport in Siberia.
Because it provoked President Vladimir Putin to open, Hodorkovski was convicted, his oil company, Yukos, was confiscated and his pro-democratic efforts were diminished.
4 people lost their lives after the police fired rubber bullets at protestors in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police fired rubber bullets into the crowd demonstrating against the proposed new constitution of the country, said an official on Wednesday.
Violence occurred Tuesday night in Rupandehi district, about 280 km west of the capital Kathmandu.
According to Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, head of the district police, over 1,000 protesters gathered in front of a police station, and some of them threw stones and molotov cocktails.
Mr. Dhakal said that police forces used tear gas after which they fired fire in the air before using rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured after he said.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which are known to kill but are usually used as a less lethal alternative, caused so many deaths.
The clash was the last event after weeks of violent protests in the southern region of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group claim that the new provinces established on the basis of the new constitution would dilute their political influence.
Protests also existed in western Nepal, where the ethnic Tharus group wants its own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 policemen, were killed in violent clashes launched on 10 August,
when four important political parties signed an agreement for the division of the country into the provinces - a major step towards a new constitution but an extremely controversial problem in Nepal, a country governed at central level for hundreds of years.
The process of drafting a new constitution began in 2008, but the legislators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
This week, in Kathmandu, the legislators voted on the clauses in the draft constitution and officials said that the new card could be adopted on Sunday.
We will not use wire fences, dogs, cops and weapons
The Prime Minister continues his exchange of remarks with the Hungarian authorities.
At the opening of the meeting of the Government of Wednesday, Ponta reiterated Romania's firm position towards the refugee crisis.
We are making every effort to manage the refugee crisis, all institutions have a coordinated opinion.
Romania does not agree and will not apply anti-democratic measures, watchdogs, wire fences or gun policemen.
"It is a shame for 21st century Europe to apply 30s methods," Victor Ponta said.
"The Prime Minister also said that all data and details of the refugee crisis will be discussed and established at the CSAT meeting on Thursday." the Prime Minister concluded.
NHC announces 60% probability of cyclone south of Cape Verde Islands
A broad low-pressure front at about 560 km south of the southernmost point of Cape Verde Islands is likely to become a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, U.S. National Center for Hurricanes said Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure front about half the distance between Cape Verde Islands and Lesser Antilles also presents a 60% probability of formation of a tropical cyclone in the next two days, added the weather forecaster in Miami.
Weight reduction surgery could be useful for mildly obese diabetics
The benefits of weight reduction surgery for people with mild obesity, with type 2 diabetes, may be maintained for at least five years, according to a new study.
It is still premature to tell if diabetics with mild obesity live longer after surgery of weight loss than those who follow non-surgical treatments.
"It takes a lot of time to centralize mortality data," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, a specialist in obesity surgery, who wrote an article about the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss, known as bariatric surgery, uses different methods to reduce the stomach.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has proven to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted on people with morbid obesity, with a body mass index (BMI) 35 or higher.
BMI, a weight measurement unit relative to height, is considered normal in the range 18.5-24.9.
The BMI value of at least 25 indicates that a person is overweight and people with BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI by accessing: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers at General Min-Sheng Hospital in Taiwan used close data after 2007 in a trial comparing two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and manson gastrectomy - in medical treatment of type 2 diabetes in people with mild obesity.
The mean BMI in those who underwent surgery decreased from 31 to 24.5 to the end of the fifth year in the study.
Meanwhile, BMI in people who received non-surgical treatments against diabetes remained almost at the same level, i.e. 29.
Among those who had surgery, diabetes cured completely at 36% and partially at 28%.
In the group treated by medical methods, by comparison, diabetes has completely cured at only 1% and partly at only 2% of subjects.
In addition, blood pressure control, triglycerides and bad LDL cholesterol "were generally better in the surgical group", concluded the authors.
Researchers also monitored the blood level of haemoglobin A1c, which reflects the level of blood glucose in time.
Researchers write that the optimal level of A1c haemoglobin is below 7%.
Following surgery, mean haemoglobin A1c decreased from approximately 9% to approximately 6%.
However, in the group treated by medical methods, it remained at approximately 8%.
But this improved "glycemic control" - reflected by improved haemoglobin levels A1c - did not reduce the mortality rate to five years, according to chief researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results associated with the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, compared with the group with gastrectomy in mansoon, the bypass surgery group lost more weight (18.7 versus 14.2 kg), recorded more significant decreases in BMI (7.4 versus 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% versus 2.1%), and presented a higher probability of complete remission of diabetes (46.9% compared to 16.7%).
Although the new study does not indicate a benefit in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study carried out on high weight people in Sweden that surgery prolongs life, says Blackstone, from Arizona University, Faculty of Medicine - Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obese people who had bariatric surgery presented a probability of approximately 29% lower death after 15 years compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not indicate a benefit in survival in patients undergoing surgery, Blackstone said it was an optimistic aspect for people with BMI below 35 interested in the procedure.
"This is the point where this work is critical because it claims that this surgery is safe in the lower BMI group," she says, without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone added that patients and their doctors should start - to take the weight seriously then the patient's BMI reaches 27-30.
"I think we wait too long until we urge people to take this aspect seriously," she said.
I think once they've accumulated these genetic changes that shorten their bodies by predisposing them to obesity and diabetes, it's extremely hard to get back to normal.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT news
Europe could not receive all refugees, Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
Tibetan Buddhist leader sent an appeal to put an end to violence in refugee mother countries.
Dalai Lama spoke about the current refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Center for Compassion in Oxford, dedicated to ethics studies, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to Britain.
He said that, in the current situation, the interests of humanity should prevail in front of the interests of each nation and even of each continent.
He also pointed out that, although admirable, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is inadequate.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria's efforts to cope with the crisis, he stressed that it is only a temporary solution.
"It is wonderful to care for a few thousand refugees, but we must also think about long-term solutions to bring true peace and development, especially through education, in Muslim countries," he said.
In the end, we need to think about ways to reduce crime in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The force never solved these problems," he added.
Regarding the problem of violence, Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions after the terrorist attacks on 11 September, claiming that the U.S. violent response generated a chain of uncontrollable events.
After the events of 11 September, I expressed my condolences in a letter addressed to President Bush and told him to resolve this problem without resorting to violence.
I know his motives were strong but he used force and generated unexpected consequences," Dalai Lama said.
Four-fold increase in the number of children who have ingested detergent in the last 4 years
According to the Georgia Anti-Poison Centre, U.S. anti-poison centres have reported an increase of approximately 400% since 2010 in the number of children under 12 who have swallowed hand detergents with a high alcohol content.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Anti-Poison Centre, cases of hand-cleaning in children under 12 years of age reported in anti-poisonous centres increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children have more frequent access to these products and unfortunately one percent of them reach the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
Lopez said some children drink detergent intentionally and others do it to impress their friends or to respond to challenges on social networks.
YouTube can watch movies that present adolescents how they drink detergent to create cheap drinks.
Apparently the teens mixed the detergent with drinking water to get a stronger drink.
Smaller children can be attracted by the attractive smell of the detergent.
"A child doesn't think it hurts him," Lopez says.
Many of the most attractive types (hand detergents) are the perfumed ones.
Clean hands with strawberry flavor, grape, orange are the most attractive for children.
The hand cleaner contains approximately 45-95% alcohol.
Especially in small children, only a few swallows can cause alcohol poisoning.
"It's very concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, Medical Director of the Anti-Poison Center at the University Hospital in Kansas, for the Fox 4 channel in Kansas City.
Thus, we avoid leaving a glass of whiskey on the table, but people leave these hand cleaners in accessible places and if the little ones get to them, this is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently ingested at school the equivalent of four sprays with strawberry-flavoured hand cleaner, arrived at the emergency room to receive treatment.
He had alcohol 179, twice the threshold at which an adult is considered by law under the influence of alcohol, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room doctor who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah had the curse and couldn't go when he arrived at the emergency room.
The doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children's hospital to identify the signs of brain injury, because the girl fell and hit her head because of alcohol, Ritchey said.
"It was scary," Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, said for CNN.
It could have been fatal.
Lopez recommended parents and teachers to use wet products or napkins without alcohol and not to leave the detergent at the children's disposal.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some detergents have been associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after they swallowed the detergent from their hands containing an undeclared toxic ingredient.
The sanitary authorities assumed that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, and not ethyl alcohol, specified as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-class New York students planned to poison their “bad” teacher by “putting antibacterial products in class” according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to the detergent of hands and banned him in his classroom.
The police considered the plan to be "insignificant" and referred the disciplinary issue to the school inspectorate.
Rumour Mill: There are no misunderstandings in Celtic
Griffiths dismantles rumors about Celtic's misunderstandings, and Delia admits that Hoops is not the best time, but they'll come back.
Hearts faced with SFA regarding Neilson and Warburton's accusations are cautious about the acquisitions in January that affected the team's unit
Dons grows the difference from Celtic to five points
The criminalization of ADAM Rooney in the first rendezvous brought the Aberdeens a narrow victory in front of the Hamiltons in Pittodria, Dons getting a five-point difference between them and Celtic.
Griffiths dismantles rumors related to misunderstandings
There were rumors of misunderstanding in Celtic, demoted by Griffiths, who insisted that he and his team were not subjected to increased pressure as they were preparing to face the leaders of the Dutch league.
I don't think we feel the pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
Absence of Scots in the race for title bores the Dutch - by Boer
The former midwayer of Rangers and former Dutch international player Ronald de Boer said Dutch football supporters lost interest in Celtic because they don't fight for the title with Rangers.
De Boer, now Ambassador of the Ajax, said: “In the Netherlands I no longer transmit the summary of Celtic matches; why?”
Because they're not Rangers there.
Here, we're not just talking about the return of the Rangers.
It's talking about Old Firm.
We're talking about both teams together and there's the interest going on.
The tension is high in the Old Firm games and not only the Scots want to see these matches.
I'll change the situation, Promises Dela.
RONNY Deila accepted Celtic's struggle with battles, but the Norwegian chief promised to change the situation.
The defeat of Malmo and the subsequent elimination of the Champions League were followed by the defeat in front of Aberdeen that played in 10 people, now in the top of the ranking with a five-point advance.
But Deila said, "Celtic has had periods before and they will return."
We want to get out of this situation as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and many people are extremely angry or sad about what's going on.
We feel the same way - but we have to move on.
We need the support of Celtic because players are getting better as well.
It's extremely important to remain united now.
Warburton's concern with transfers from January
Despite the comments made only a few weeks ago that suggested identifying some targets for transfers in January, the head of the Rangers, Mark Warburton is cautious when it comes to transfers, insisting that he does not wish to affect the team's unit.
The former head of Brentford said: “The transfer period in January is very different from the one in the summer.”
In the case of the players transferred this summer, there is the period before the season in which they can be integrated, which you could observe this season in our group.
The team's doing very well.
Sometimes you get worse if you bring players that aren't necessary.
Celtic targets Michu after withdrawal
The striker from Swansea, Michu, associated with Celtic during the transfer period, suggested that he might withdraw from the expiry of the Swans contract.
The 29-year-old player struggled two years with ankle problems and failed to leave Wales in the summer.
Hearts faced with SFA regarding Neilson's comments
Hearts drove with 2-1 when Paterson was removed and lost with 3-2, but the red card of the foundation was then cancelled - the third red card cancelled in eight months.
Neilson maintains his statements, insisting: “I have not questioned integrity, I have not commented on performance.”
Griffiths swears to avoid Tyncastle
The invincible Hibee was picked up after he admitted to singing a song with offensive lyrics about his former Hearts player, Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in March 2014 in a pub in the Roseburn region of Edinburgh before a derby with Edinburgh at Tynacastle.
"It was derby and it was the enthusiasm of the moment," the striker said, adding: "I don't have to say that I'm not going back to Tynacastle unless I play for Celtic."
Tannadice Council trusts Dundee United management - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly insists that the Dundee United Council still trusts that the management team will change the situation - but agrees that the decline on the ground must end.
I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We'll bring the boys back in shape," Donnelly said.
McInnes is happy for "filthy victory" against Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits that the team in Aberdeen must cling desperately to Hamilton Accies to get the seventh successive victory in the league, which brought them five points in front of Celtic due to the punishment shot from the first shot carried out by Adam Rooney.
McInnes said: "There is no team that won something, in the cup or league, and that didn't win games like this."
Unemployment rate in Scotland remains unchanged as Britain grows
The unemployment rate in Scotland remains unchanged, being 164,000 in May, while the number of unemployed in the United Kingdom totally increased by 10,000, reaching 1.82 million in the same period.
The unemployment rate of 5.9% in Scotland was higher than that in Britain, 5.5%, according to the figures presented by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Meanwhile, the employment rate in Scotland decreased by 12,000 over the period of three months, the number of those currently employed is 2.612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland decreased by 74.0% in that quarter - a figure above the average of 73.5 in Britain.
Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell, commenting on the latest figures, said: “The long-term plan of authorities laid the foundation for a stronger economy.”
It's been almost a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
Over the past 12 months, we have seen improvements in the labour market in Scotland, employment rates in growth and the unemployment rate in decline.
Why am I witnessing an execution in Oklahoma
During today's day, except for a late legal intervention, I'll see how a man is sentenced to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll stay in a room for observers in the execution room of the Penitentiary of Oklahoma and I'll see how Richard Glossip is executed by administering the lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation came first in January, through his best friend, and although I was shocked, I accepted.
As the day approaches rightly, it frightens me.
So why do I do it?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story of capital punishment.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists can be witnesses to executions in America and because requests usually exceed the number of places available, there is a macabre lottery to decide who will be chosen.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of places reserved for press representatives from 12 to five.
The chosen will look impartially at the execution.
I can't do that.
I would stand by Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I also developed my own relationship with him over the months of phone conversations and a visit that lasted two and a half hours.
I like the guy.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to have a notebook and a pen to note what I see.
I'll have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist in Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story as he wishes, get access.
I cried at her.
He admitted that "he could have formulated better," but he still felt that I was wrong.
Richard Glossip disagreed with some of the things I said and wrote them.
Don't tell me what to write and I wouldn't do it if he asked me.
I told him he could get me out of the witness list any time.
However, he wishes to have an international report written on the subject.
He believes that if he dies, advertising will help move against capital punishment.
Kim Bellware, reporter at Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to know more about the case, listen to the series of media files that I did.
I won't come back here on all the details.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after Barry Van Tree's murder make him guilty of complicity.
But I think it's very likely he's not guilty of murder.
I certainly don't think there was enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
And I'll watch him die from this perspective.
I can't claim to be totally objective.
For this, you can read the articles written by other reporters.
From me you'll find out what it's like to watch a man I like dying useless.
Peter Moody claims that the Stewarts tried to spy on him and threatened to withdraw from the race
Peter Moody said that stars racing Victoria or tried to infiltrate a spy at his stables last year and threatened to withdraw immediately from the race.
He launched an attack on the stars and the integrity department of Racing Victoria, claiming that they are carrying out a personal campaign against him, the drop that filled the glass by removing Lady Dad from the race due to a treatment administered on the day of the race.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for the field of courses and that he is put in a difficult situation when it comes to the positive result of Lidari's cobalt test, for which he has no explanation.
For 18 months he swallowed his words concerning statements about spies and did not want to resemble "the fox that does not reach grapes".
"I wasn't going to say anything about that aspect and I've been silent for a long time, but sometimes you get to such a high level of frustration that everything suddenly rages," Moody said.
It's known he went on.
Sometimes you react and have to bear the consequences, and I will have to live with what I said.
Tonight I'll go home and sleep quietly.
I want to head up and I want the owners I work with to see that you're trying to give them everything that's best.
From the moment they start to believe that it doesn't happen that way, I have to give up the coaching job.
Then I'll have to think about what I'll do with my certification.
Previously, Moody dropped the bomb in an interview for racing.com in which he said the integrity department tried to spy on his stables.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room next to a man - whose name I'll tell him if I'm asked - and offered to hire him at my stables to provide information about the activity there," Moody told Racing.com.
Obviously he considers me a cheater.
If so, then you should all resign because you were incompetent in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former president of RVL, David Moodie, current president of RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of RVL, knew at that time and today.
Should I think it's personal?
Is it necessary for RVL to start having a spine and may take responsibility outside the trainers for what is happening in the industry?
Do I have a bad influence on the industry?
So bad is my influence on the industry?
Maybe that's how I see the others.
Maybe I need to take my license and put me aside and I have no doubt that the statements I make now might lead them to think about this variant.
But I got to the point where I don't care anymore, and that makes me sad.
It makes me very sad.
I'll put pressure on and get them to make a decision.
My family supports me and I can go.
The frustration of the trainer increased with the long investigation into cobalt testing involving Lidari and the elimination led him to state that he could "put his license on the table".
Moody, whose name is most often associated with the training of the unconquered Black Caviar champion, has labeled the treatment rule of the day of the race as "ridical" after applying on the tracks a cataplasm with mud or clay, which violates the rules.
It violates the rules of the race.
I have to take full responsibility for this," he says.
One of my employees accidentally put his foot on.
It could have happened last night.
It could have happened yesterday, which happened.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody could be disqualified for three months for the course day treatment consisting of the application of the cataplasm, for which the stewarzies have opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
The people who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all understand that there is a need for rules but it has gone too far," Moody said.
The driver who hit and ran from the scene in Cobram was arrested
Police arrested a man after a collision with a biker produced in Cobram at the end of the week and followed by an escape from the accident site.
The biker was transported by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital, being seriously injured after being hit on Saturday morning by a car on the Murray Valley motorway.
Police officials say the driver of the vehicle did not stop to help the injured biker.
Monday, a 50-year-old man, surrendered to the Shepparton police.
It appears that he will be accused of fleeing from the scene of the accident, the failure to provide first aid and other road offences.
The biker, a 40-year-old man in Cobram, remains hospitalized in stable condition.
Coach Melbourne Storm, Craig Bellamy, is responding to the charges of wrestling.
Coach Melbourne Storm, Craig Bellamy, called the criticisms brought about by his team as "distorted subjects" brought up by the top two NRL favorites.
Coach Sydney Roosters, Trent Robinson, said the referees allowed Storm players to "take the team at the battle won by Storm in the final qualifying played Friday night in Sydney.
The coach at Brisbane Broncos, Wayne Bennett, made an easy reference to Storm after his team's victory at the North Queensland Cowboys qualifying game, played Saturday night, when he called that game a "demonstration" of the rugby league and said that the two teams in Queensland are not very good at wrestling.
Bellamy jumped into the defense of his team's approach to the placarding tactic and said players were simply focusing on "contact" when they liked.
Bellamy says she got her trust after two important coaches criticized her team, which means they were worried Storm would beat them.
"And things don't stop here - I didn't hear Trent Robinson complain about wrestling when they beat us with score 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed anything all year in our defensive systems or techniques, so just that in the last six weeks I've really put the emphasis on contact in plates and so I've changed the situation.
Trent is in this three-year function and obviously has a wonderful team so he's probably not used to losing and was a shock to him.
We're funny how it always happens this time of year.
Bellamy disagreed with Bennett's idea of "soul football", reminding his mentor St George-Illawarra Dragons of Bennett won the championship in 2010 by playing football "plier".
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He argued by comparing his game Saturday night with our game Friday night and talked about how exciting the game was," Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010, St George got a lot of criticism because it was a boring team and Wayne said he didn't care as much as black under the nail.
But now he has a team that can play what we consider to be exciting football, especially because of the fast young ones.
This kind of game you want to do it when you have such players.
He brought this argument in 2010, now wants everyone to adopt his style of play - not any team has two mediums like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to be able to play so.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things because they're kind of worried about the game with us.
Six weeks ago they probably weren't thinking about us when they were thinking about important games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the match between Storm and Roosters was a sharper score match compared to the match between Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos match was probably a good match, I haven't seen him yet, how much was the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, in our game there were two more trials, that's exciting game?
Or is it exciting to pause and not make your mark?
They're plans for me.
If I talk about us, it means that at some point we could meet them.
Storm is free this weekend because they won the right to play home either with North Queensland Cowboys or with Cronulla Sharks, in the end of next Saturday's Preliminarys at AAMI Park, putting tickets on sale from next Tuesday morning.
Stevan Hogg used the girl's phone to lure the pedophiles to send pictures
A pedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to ask for images of abused children.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone when she was sleeping and then authenticated in an online messaging service where another user sent her a series of indecent images with children as a subject.
The girl then woke up and noticed the disappearance of the phone, which she found in Hogg's hand while she slept.
She looked on the phone and found the disturbing messages after which she immediately alerted her mother.
After arrival, the police saw the five photos and then analyzed computers found at that address and found "concerning" searches on the Internet using terms to find indecent images with children.
Hogg claimed he did it to "attract the pedophiles" on the Internet before "he claims he's a cop to scare them."
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson said to the Dundee court: “He said it is an addiction – that it is dependent on scaring people.
He admitted that he did the computer searches but said he did it because he wanted to be a cop to scare the pedophiles.
He was asked about the conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and the fact that he asked the person to send him more photos.
He said he did it to lure.
He said he doesn't think clearly when he drinks and wants to see images of rape and murder.
Mr. Robertson added: “When the girl found the messages on the phone, she shouted and trembled and cried.
The girl saw the indecent images on the phone and the defendant was confronted.
The girl was interviewed and told that the defendant was using the computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Last year, on 14 June, 23-year-old Hogg, residing in Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to accusations that he had made or taken indecent pictures of children, and violated the conditions of parole conditioned on 25 January this year and did not appear before the court at the appearance of 24 March this year.
Defense lawyer Gregor Sim called for Hogg not to be registered in the sex offenders' register because it can be said that this offence "has not involved a significant sexual aspect".
Judge Alistair Carmichael postponed his sentence until October for social reports.
Hogg was released on bail in this file but remained in custody before appearances for other files.
It was passed in the register of sex offenders before the sentence was given.
Robert Mugabe, President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, gave the wrong speech in Parliament
Early in the year, Mr. Mugabe, the oldest African leader, fell on the steps of a podium.
However, the shooting of the fall has not become viral on the social networks.
The opening of the parliamentary session was also disrupted by representatives of the opposition who said they would have received anonymous death threats, threatening that Mr Mugabe would not have been tried during his speech.
Last month they abandoned him during his speech in Parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The head of the parliamentary group Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), Innocent Gonese, said that seven opposition politicians had received text messages on mobile phones, being warned not to disturb Mr. Mugabe's speech.
"The message was sent by a hidden number but it is called "death," he told the journalists after Mr. Mugabe's speech.
It warns Members concerned that immunity applies only in Parliament and once they leave Parliament, parliamentary immunity no longer has value.
The head of the parliamentary group said that the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, is “worried” about threats passed on to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will make 30,000 offers
It is expected that Hewlett-Packard will make between 25,000 and 30,000 available as part of the restructuring and cost reduction company's efforts in the service sector.
This year. HP will split into stock exchanges in two companies, separating the division of computers and printers from corporate hardware operations and services that are growing brightly.
The expected availability will bring costs of approximately $2.7 billion starting in the fourth quarter, HP said.
"These restructurings will bring new Hewlett Packard Enterprise a more competitive and cost-sustainable structure," said Meg Whitman, President and CEO HP, who will lead the unit after the breakdown.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more concentrated than HP currently and will own a large business portfolio that will contribute to the transition of firms to the new business style," Whitman said.
Acting as a separate society, we are better placed than ever to meet the growing requirements of our global customers.
According to a company statement, Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have annual revenues of over $50 billion and “will focus on providing integrated solutions without rivals” to companies.
A company set up in 1930 by Stanford University, Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, with the purpose of the production of electrical equipment and whose garage in Palo Alto was called the Silicon Valley league.
HP went through a massive reorganization to adapt to switching from traditional computers to mobile devices.
The measure taken by HP, the second largest computer producer in the world and one of the largest companies in the US technology field, is the most recent in the field, based on the idea that companies that focus their attention better in a direction have a better performance.
FriendsFest: The comedy series that taught us important lessons about friendship between men
The absence of similar characters in the series is evident, given that the need for men to open is now more desperate than ever, suicide rates among young men reaching the top of the last 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the main cause of death in 20-45-year-old men in Britain, and remains three times more frequent in men than in women.
In an attempt to address the problem, the Campaign against unhappy life (Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM)) designated 2015 as the Year of Man, wanting to ask under the sign of the culture that prevents men from asking for help when they need it.
Friendship lies at the centre of the struggle towards the success of this challenge.
A recent study conducted in more than 2000 high school students with symptoms of depression concluded that if the patient is surrounded by enough friends "with a healthy mood", his chances of recovery are doubled.
To the same extent, for people who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends reduces to half the likelihood of mental disorders appearing.
Of course, for friendship to take effect, it must first be accessible.
In this era of communication dominated by social networks, where emphasis is placed on style rather than substance, the immediate nature of the response often has priority before contact with meaning.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to create the appearance of a strong personality, open to fun and success, even if isolation is actually the dominant one.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the cost of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship - which further affects our mental health.
The billionaire inventor of a video game recently explained that money really doesn't buy happiness.
The beauty of the Friends series was that it focused on this idea.
The characters were not defined by the workplace but by their own personality, which they showed by interacting as friends.
The humor of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, the moments he looks at football in comfortable armchairs and Ross' passion for Rachel came from knowing that men can associate with this situation, even though they often avoid exploring their feelings completely.
As one social worker explained to me: "my role in listening to people who tend to commit suicide and depressed has shown how even the smallest interactions with friends can make a difference."
Often, people who call on us do not feel able to talk to their friends.
The old saying to handle yourself is strong, as is the feeling of being perceived as weak person if you speak openly about problems.
Friends is one of the series that come to mind when I try to offer more mechanisms for long-term psychological adaptation.
The series highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
As much as it helps the objective, external intervention, through the telephone, people arriving at times of despair, long-term support comes from family and close friends.
Thus, if you participate this weekend at FriendsFest organized by Comedy Central, with the complete play of filming platforms to celebrate the event, why not invite your friends to a coffee in Central Perk.
Or, and better, if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends is broadcast by Comedy Central from the beginning to the end - all 236 episodes - on the occasion #FriendsFest
Di Maria marks and helps PSG to give Malmo away
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after he scored against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored on Tuesday in his debut match in the Champions League and helped PSG set up in front of the Swedish Malmo team.
We continue to present the game's chronicle and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani have done their duty, Paris Saint-Germain starting the series of matches in the Champions League groups, with a peaceful 2-0 victory against Malmo in the game played on Tuesday on Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored in less than four minutes from the start of her debut match in the Champions League in the PSG team, bringing the French champions to the advantage although they missed a number of occasions before securing their goal goal goal scored by Cavani in the minute 61.
Reaching the Group A with Real Madrid and Chahtior Donetsk, Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions because the objective of the French team is not only to qualify in optimal terms but also to improve the course towards final quarters in each of the last three tournaments.
However, although they took points, Laurent Blanc's students were far from a perfect painting, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic who wasted the opportunity to empty after being replaced by the team in his hometown and the club where his brilliant career began in 1999.
"It is not easy to win home or move into the Champions League, so the 2-0 victory creates problems for our opponents and establishes a comfortable difference with the next class, even if there are issues we need to improve throughout the season," says Blanc.
It's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we did, although I'm sorry we couldn't give another one or two goals.
Ibrahimovic returned after the accident at one of the three changes to the Paris team, with a 2-2 remission obtained from Bordeaux in Liga 1 on the weekend, but Di Maria took over the lights in the four minutes.
Last month when he was transferred from Manchester United, the Argentine offensive medium was named the man who will lead the PSG to the next level in Europe and proved this when he stood at Marco Verratti's pace behind Malmo's defense before he incredibly swooped over Johan Wiland, in the long corner of the right gate.
But if someone expected PSG to win the victory by punching their fingers, they were disappointed.
Malmo, who defeated Celtic in play-off to reach this stage and entered the field with nine national team owners, with a defense of five and two middle defensive men, was a strong opponent.
But their attack was not impressive, except by making Nikola Djurdjic's kick who passed Kevin Trapp's post in the 34th minute.
Instead, PSG players slowed down the pace several times, giving a few unnecessary and unfinished passes, even Ibrahimovic who missed no less than five attempts only in the first round and was then replaced by Cavani even after the game resumed.
Ibrahimovic, however, proved much more capable of supporting his colleagues, being the one that Di Maria sent in a hijacked kick by Wiland over the gate in the minute 52.
The second goal was finally entered after spending an hour in the game, thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan who signed up for the sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic passed from Maxwell's focus.
This goal eliminated Malmo's hopes that they'll rebalance the score and just a superb stop from Wiland's distance for rejecting David Luiz kept the final score before the new Ezequiel Lavezzi entrance cancels a void in extensions.
Norwegian coach of the Malmo team, Age Hareide, later said that PSG was with a class over and that "the last match I played in the Champions League was last December."
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, which does not rise to the same level.
Qualifications aren't enough.
Put your hat down for PSG.
They made an excellent game.
Glencore collects $2.5 billion from stock sales
The Swiss mining giant Glencore, hit by the decline in stock prices on the commodity exchange, has raised $2.5 billion from the sale of shares as part of a comprehensive debt reduction plan.
Glencore company, quoted on the London Stock Exchange, said it sold new shares worth £1.6 billion to pay off the debt.
After losing 57% of its market value this year, the company is forced into collapse prices on the commodity market because the decline in China's economic activity influences demand and causes market disaster.
The preferential subscription fee increased the price of Glencore shares on the London Stock Exchange in Wednesday morning transactions.
The shares rose by 2.77% to 131.60 shillings in the FTSE 100 indexes, which opened at a value of 0.69% higher.
Glencore unveiled the sale of $2.5 billion shares as part of larger plans to cover almost a third of its $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new shares at a price of 125 shillings per share, 2.4% less than the closing price on Tuesday.
It has taken 1.3 billion shares out of the company, representing 9.99% of the group.
Concern about the rise in the prolonged stagnation of the Chinese economy has led to a substantial increase in iron ore prices by about half and coal, copper and other goods have fallen by 20-40%.
Xi insists on expanding the global economy
Tuesday, President Xi Jinping told a reform group that the economy needs to open wider to the outside world to fuel growth.
"China must commit itself to attracting foreign investment and expertise and improve opening policies," Xi said at the 16th Meeting of the Central Steering Group for the Continuation of General Reforms (Central Leading Group for Deepening Overall Reform).
Promoting the opening and encouraging of reforms will bring new impetus and vitality and make way for economic growth, Xi said.
The steering group adopted a series of guidelines, including a negative market access regulation list, relaxing customs control policies, encouraging state companies to absorb private capital and reorganising the resident registration system.
According to the statement, a negative list will be drawn up that will identify sectors and areas of activity in which investments are not permitted.
The system will be tested gradually and improved by testing programs.
According to the declaration, the measure is important because it will provide the market with a more important role in resource allocation, ensuring a legal-based business environment and providing a wider market opening.
State authorities will also weaken controls on the powers that they delegate to companies, ensuring that these companies decide how to run their business.
China will also allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
In an attempt to open state-controlled sectors, several sectors will be open to private investment.
"The State authorities will not change their foreign investment policy and will protect the legitimate interests of companies established by foreign investment and provide them with better services," he said.
In addition, it will be easier for foreign citizens to apply for permanent residence permits or so-called "green cards", by optimizing the requirements and smoothing the application process.
The meeting also discussed the guarantee of the right to practice of lawyers and the education of judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement made after the meeting.
Education unions, not satisfied with the proposal of the government to increase wages by 10%
The negotiations between Prime Minister Victor Ponta and the union leaders of Education have not achieved any results, the government proposing a 10% increase in salary from 1 December with payment on 1 January 2016, and the unions wanted a 15% increase in November, or 20% increase in December.
The talks took place at Victoria Palace on Tuesday evening, the premier being accompanied by the Minister of Education, Sorin Cimpeanu, Minister of Finance, Eugen Teodorovici and Minister of Labour, Rovana Plumb.
The government's proposal today has not satisfied us, otherwise we would not have been able to summon the leadership of our federations.
The 10 percent that we were promised today represents less for us than we expected.
"In fact, these 10 percent are the money that we have stipulated in our agreement with the Government last year, for 2016," said Anton Hadar, President Alma Mater, at the end of the discussions.
Ponta: Health and education in the future will be the areas in which we will invest all the money we have
According to him, on Thursday, there will be a meeting of the FSLI at which the representatives of the Government will also participate to present to the representatives of the confederates of the country the proposal for wage growth, followed by unionists deciding whether to accept the Executive's offer.
The Prime Minister also told trade unionists that the government was trying to send the wage law to Parliament as quickly as possible, so that it could enter into force on 1 December.

Immigrant Crisis: Tragedy in the Aegean Sea
At least 22 immigrants drowned in Turkish territorial waters on Tuesday after the boat was wrecked.
Among the victims were 11 women and 5 children, AFP informs, according to Yahoo News.
The boat was located in the Aegean Sea and headed to the Greek island Kos.
Turkey's coast guard reported that it managed to save 249 people who were in the wrecked boat, but still do not know their nationality.
Previously, Monday, two other people died while trying to cross the Aegean Sea.
Also, in the weekend, 34 immigrants, including 4 babies and 11 children, drowned off the Greek island of Farmakonisi, 15 kilometres from the Turkish coast.
The situation was similar: the boat transports more people than its capacity, so it sank.
The route has become popular lately for immigrants who want to escape the war and heavy life in countries such as Syria or Iraq.
Over 100 Stewardese, fired because they were too fat
The Air India airline fired about 130 stewarzi and Stewardese because they were overweight, announced the company at the end of last week.
The state company announced that the decision was made for security reasons and recent government regulations, but critics say the measure is "ridiculous" and "sexist shock," says The Washington Post.
Mass firing is the most recent of a ten-year struggle between the company and the busiest stewardesses.
The weight limit for them dates back to the '80s, when Air India started using the ideal weight and height graphics.
In 2006, Air India fired the new Stewardese considered "extraordinary overweights", since this "may have an effect on reflections and may prevent the necessary agility to carry out emergency measures".
The Stewardes sued the company, won and were reemployed, but the company fired them again in 2009.
"All efforts to make them weak have failed," explains one company spokesman.

A Star footballer gives Gigi Becali lessons on promoting young players.
If the champion's financier decided to close the Football Academy in which he had invested a considerable amount, the founder Paul Papp opened a football school.
The "Paul Papp" Academy will work in Dej town, with local children waiting for a first selection action.
I'm extremely happy that I got to this stage, to give the start of the Football Academy that bears my name.
For me, it is extremely important to find talented children, who can play football without worrying about materials in training.
They must have only one care: that of playing football as best.
Technical details should not be taken care of.
They must value their talent.
This is what he wants to do. The 'Paul Papp' Football Academy.
"I'm also waiting for Mayor Costan Morar at the first selection of children, to show them that he's with them," Papp footballer said for dejean.ro.
At the Academy of the Founding of the Star, children are expected to grow up to 11 years old.
The whole party wants governance.
PSD interim president Liviu Dragnea said Tuesday that the whole party wants to remain in government, and, if the Prime Minister wants, the PSD Congress will formalize this decision.
I understand that Mr. Ponta is waiting for this decision from the PSD Congress, everyone wants to rule, all the party.
If we want to formalize through a Congress ruling, we will do so too.
There won't be any emotion about it.
"There have been no elements, voices in the party, party opinions giving someone insecure to the government or giving someone the impression that someone in the party does not want PSD to remain in government, in the current government, with the current prime minister," Dragnea said at the end of the Permanent Office of the PSD.
PSD announced when it will hold a convention - what will be decided then
Prime Minister Victor Ponta said Tuesday that it is important that, at the PSD Congress, beyond the choice of leadership, give a clear message if the continuation of the government is desired or if the party decides to go into opposition.
Dragnea: I'll announce on Monday if I'm going to apply for a function at Congress
On the other hand, Liviu Dragnea will announce next month if you apply for a leadership function at the future Congress.
I will sing, Monday, after the Executive Committee, if the date of the congress is also set.
"I'll announce if I'm running for a party leadership function," Dragnea said at the end of the Tuesday session of the Permanent National Bureau of the PSD.
I'm wondering if the hesitation with respect to the candidate's announcement has anything to do with the file or, Dragnea said she doesn't have this problem.
I don't have the problem you're referring to, but I think it's fair and honest with all my colleagues in the party to announce or not an application when the Congress's date is formally fixed.
"It's the only motivation," said Dragnea.
The vast majority of social-democratic subsidiaries proposed extraordinary PSD Congress on 11 October, and the exact date of Congress will be decided on Monday by the Party's Executive Committee.

Simona Halep is facing a crucial decision for her career, and she has to choose whether or not she will continue to collaborate with Coach Darren Cahill.

It wasn't normal, I wasn't respected
Victor Piturca revealed how he broke up with Romania's national team last fall.
The former selectioner testified that he did not understand with President FRF, Razvan Burleanu, after he took Mircea Sandu's place, and thus made the decision to leave the country.
Eventually, he proposed to the head of the Federation to raise his salary substantially to remain, but he was refused.
Right now, I'm not sorry I left the national.
Then I felt bad, leaving a job behind.
That's how I thought it was good for me then and I think it was good for me.
What happens to me when I was a picker, it wasn't normal, I wasn't respected, I didn't respect my work.
I worked well with those before the Federation, but when Burleanu came to the Federation he came with a preconceived idea, he didn't know me, found out different opinions from the press about me.
It didn't change me because it was very hard at the time, with the results we had, plus the financial situation in the middle.
We continued work, everything went very well and probably changed and he changed his ideas.
But I wanted to go.
If he really wanted me to stay, I offered them a contract bill.
We have around 400 and a thousand euros a year, and I have about 600 thousand euros a year.
I didn't talk to Burleanu, but with his right hand.
"It was agreed, but only if we finish first in the group," Victor Piturca said at Dolce Sport.
Victor Piturca resigned from Romania in autumn last year, although the team had good results in the Euro 2016 preliminarys.

Rare disease a man suffers from
American Nick Hess was suspected by his family of being alcoholic, the wife even filming him when he was dizzy, he could barely keep his feet and his words were hard to understand.
Although the 35-year-old man said he didn't drink alcohol, it was visible that he was drunk.
When he first accused me of being drunk, without drinking, I thought she was crazy.
"But friends and family believed 'maybe they drank by themselves, he's an alcoholic in secret'," he says, according to Mirror.
When he saw his wife's films with him, the man in Columbus, Ohio, he just didn't recognize himself: "I looked in my eyes and I wasn't there."
'It was awful, I didn't remember anything.'
Besides, his wife, who, although she doubted himself for a while, finally went with him to countless doctors, remembers that Nick's breath smelled of alcohol.
The moment Nick thought most of was when, after a minor accident, when he had been hit by another car, he discovered that he had alcohol three times above the legal line, although one night before he had consumed only one beer.
After years and investigations without number, it was discovered that Nick was suffering from an extremely rare disease, "Auto-brewery syndrome".
Practically, the body or it makes all carbohydrates consume to ferment, turning into alcohol.
The one who thought this might be Nick's disease was even the wife.
The disease hasn't had a cure yet, but since he gave up carbohydrates, Nick hasn't had such episodes.
Destroyed a Mercedes with a golf cross
A man in South Korea destroyed his car, a Mercedes S63, in protest against the services he took from his dealer.
The man "attached" his car with a golf cross, causing damage enough for the car to be removed from use, transmits BT.
The whole scene was filmed, and the video arrived on the Internet, towards the fun of those who watched it.
The man claimed that the car has defects that endanger his life and his family.
His anger came up when the dealer from whom he bought the car didn't solve his problem, as agreed.
The government approved, on Wednesday, "The National Immigration Strategy 2015-2018" and "The Action Plan for the current year", documents considered to be "another stage that Romania is pursuing in the process of modernising the immigration management process on national territory", according to a press release.
The above-mentioned source shows that the strategy aims to effectively manage the phenomenon of immigration, including general strategic objectives, specific objectives and action guidelines that reflect policies established at European level, adapted to national realities.
In view of the problems faced by the States of the immediate vicinity of Romania, measures are being taken to manage the unitary and coherent situations caused by the possible emergence of an influx of illegal immigrants into Romania, resulting from situations of political, social, economic or military crisis.
"Roman authorities will contribute to the creation of a flexible admission system, but at the same time, they will pay particular attention to citizens from countries with potential migration or which may prejudice national security," adds the above source.
The strategy identifies a number of factors that can influence immigration and asylum, including maintaining the conflict situation in Syria, reactivating the conflict in Iraq, maintaining an unstable situation in the neighbouring areas of Romania (Ukraine, Transnistria), perpetuating and increasing the intensity of the Israeli-Palestinian armed conflict.
On the other hand, the document sets out a number of general strategic objectives related to immigration, such as: promoting legal migration, more rigorous controls on the legality of the residence of third-country nationals in Romania and the corresponding application of removal measures and restrictive measures, improving the national asylum system.
The national strategy also includes specific objectives relevant to the transposition and implementation of the general strategic objectives.
These include: facilitating access on Romanian territory to third-country citizens who respond to labour force needs, promoting access to third-country citizens to Romanian higher education institutions for the areas and professions identified as deficits.
With regard to the 2015 Action Plan, the Government appreciates that it is "a means by which concrete activities are established leading to the creation of a flexible system to stop the growing migration phenomenon".
Romania, in a European top on the labour market
Latvia, Romania and Bulgaria recorded the major increase in the total labour force cost of the Member States of the European Union in the second quarter of the year compared to the same period in 2014, according to data published on Wednesday by the European Statistical Office (Eurostat).
The index refers to staff costs.
Thus, between April 2015 and June 2015, the total labour force cost rose by 1.9% in the European Union and 1.6% in the euro area.
Romania, third in the EU at increased labour force costs
The largest growths were reported in Latvia (7.9%), Romania (7.7%), Bulgaria (6.8%), Estonia (5.5%) and Lithuania (4.3%).
The only EU states where the hourly labour force cost fell in the second quarter of this year were Greece (minus 2.9%), Cyprus (minus 1.2%) and Italy (minus 0.4%).
Advances in labour-force costs in Romania from April to June 2015 are mainly due to increases in the hourly cost of the labour force in industry and services, with 7.9% and 7.6% respectively.
In the construction sector, Romania recorded an advance of 5.8% of the hourly labour force cost.
The activity report of the TVR driver, rejected in the committees: Stelian Tanase risks dismissal
Parliament's Culture Committees rejected the 2014 work report of the Board of Directors of the Roman Television Society.
In order to reject the report, 17 Members voted against the rejection ( Senator Varujan Vosganian) and one abstained.
The text of the report will be forwarded to the Permanent Bureaus meeting.
They'll decide, probably next week.
The next plenary meeting will be discussed.
"I think considering this situation will be done relatively quickly," said Senate Cultural Commission Chairman Georgica Severin.
He added that "the era of good sense" that the TVR leadership was present at this meeting, under conditions that no representative of the TVR leadership was present at the meeting of the Committees of Culture.
It was a good feeling to be in charge of TVR because no one here has been subjected to personal attacks or something like that.
The invitation has been made to CA members since last night, at an approximate hour that we didn't even know the time, but today, after the meeting of the bureaus, personally sent a fax to the TVR management inviting her.
I think the moment you're summoned, you being a budget employee, paid from public taxes and you're summoned to a meeting of the committees meeting even if you don't like it alive.
"Because it's your duty to serve, you're in an institution under the order of Parliament," Severin said after the meeting of Parliament's Culture Committees.
He added that at the meeting the financial aspects of the institution were discussed on the basis of the negative opinion of the Committees of Budget.
The debts we also saw how they continued came up with the idea that this year would have been up to date, but they were not paid from the historical ones.
"I remind you that it is not my fault or someone else in these committees who has lost that leisure with banks and with the fiscal, there are clear management issues," Severin said.
He added that after the activity report will be rejected by the plenary meeting will follow elections for a new Board of Directors, and he will choose the director general of the institution.
I don't know who will be proposed for this function.
Wonders won't happen.
It is important to make political decisions for this institution to function.
I'm not the man to lie to you, to tell you that a genius will appear who will stand in line here and fight.
I hope that those who decide, Parliament's plenary, by their vote will vote for the people who will lead the TVR with a great deal of reason.
There must be people who know what's going on there, have experience and have a lot of justice and respect for institution and tradition.
I don't know who it will be, if you ask me what qualities you have to have -- good feeling about the attitude of employees because it's a small-scale badger coming from employees, complaints, redundancies.
"When you get this 50, 60, 70, something's rotten and we're talking about the financial situation that's a disaster," the President of the Senate Cultural Commission concluded.
Although it has not been presented to Parliament, the President-General of the TVR, Stelian Tanase, sent a letter to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Valeriu Zgonea, requesting that Parliament consider a number of measures which could lead to the saving and guaranteeing of independent economic and political television, including by counting and indexing TV tax.
In its letter, Stelian Tanase requests, in addition to the indexation of the TV fee, the amendment and supplementation of HG 978/2003 on the public television service fee for updating provisions at the level of current technological changes, as well as for the regulation of the procedure on control over the payment of the TV fee and the finding of contraventions and the application of penalties and penalties.
He also wishes to issue a provision providing for the extension of the obligation for all electricity suppliers to become SRTv's agents for the collection of TV tax, by involving ANRE in the regulation of this activity.
In his view, it is necessary to establish a ceiling of up to 5% of the commission of invoicing.
Stelian Tanase calls for the reduction of VAT for the specific activities of the public television station and the contribution to the CNC from 15% to 3%, and also for the amendment of the Law 41/1994, in order to receive budgetary/funding allocations for the purchase of licenses for major cultural and sporting events - the World Football Championship, the Golden Cervus, Eurovision.
He claims that SRTv will become unable to pay in the following months since labour law obliges the employer to execute judicial decisions, even if they are not definitive, and salary rights are accorded priority to any other obligation.
The TVR administration has made constant efforts to reduce expenditure on staff and TV production.
"As well as reduced travel and other cost-generating activities, a series of commercial contracts were renegotiated, and at the end of July the TVR News post was closed", it appears in the letter of the President of the TVR.
So much to appreciate that the disastrous financial situation cannot be remedied only by its own efforts.
"Without the support of state institutions - Government, Parliament, Presidency - Roman television will be sooner or later, unable to fulfil its public mission," is mentioned in the letter.
The leadership of the Chamber of Deputies decided to send the letter to the Committee on Culture.
The son-in-law of Vasile Blaga, sent to trial
Vasile Blaga's son-in-law, Ionut Andrei Rudeanu, was sent to court on Wednesday by the prosecutors of the Park near the Bucharest Court of Appeal.
It is accused of tax evasion, in a file with prejudice of approximately 600,000 euros, under judicial control.
Andrei Rudeanu was arrested preventively on May 22.
He set up the Axis Corporate Security SRL security firm, with his mother, in April 2009, one year after he married Vasile Blaga's daughter, Agathe.
The investigation showed that, for the purpose of subtracting taxes and taxes from the state budget, representatives of a company specialising in security service provision would have created an infringement circuit consisting of several commercial companies by which fictitious transactions would have been made evident.
"In fact, the company's accounts would have been recorded for the fictitious purchase of services, which, in fact, were not provided, the state budget thus harmed by about 600,000 euros," explained the Roman Police in a press release.

Although the Arab press announces that the separation of Sanmartean from Ittihad is imminent, the entrepreneur of the manager Ladislau Boloni, Arcadie Zaporojanu, says that this will not happen again.
Boloni is very pleased with Sanmartean.
Lucian plays game title games and does it well.
The Seicians have also realized that he is the best and that it would be wrong if they gave up on him.

"There have been more discussions, like the one with Mbark Boussoufa, but nothing has come true," Zaporojanu said for Digi Sport.
Lucian Sanmartean arrived at Al-Ittihad early this year.

In addition, the Liberals criticized Sarbu's appointment to this function and announced that they would challenge her to the JRC, under conditions where she has a DNA file, but does not have the necessary preparation and experience.
Elie Sarbu has at his disposal 30 days, according to the law, to resign from the Senate, because the new function of the Court of Auditors does not allow him to do politics anymore.
The PSD senator will serve as vice-president of the Audit Authority of the Court of Auditors, the free spring after Ioan Anton was revoked, following a decision of the Constitutional Court of September 2014, which found that he was called unconstitutional.
Surprise from one of the sexiest actors: I grew up in the kitchen
How Bradley Cooper is about to play the role of a cook in the movie "Burn", the actor made a disassembly that his fans didn't expect.
In a recent interview, he said he grew more in the kitchen: "I worked most of my life as a cook."
He revealed that he had been working in the kitchen for 15 years, when he worked for a Greek restaurant, because then, in college, he continued on the same path.
The actor explained that his mother had Italian origins, so the entire childhood cooked with the Italian grandmother, relates ContactMusic.
I wondered what future plans he had in that period, Bradley Cooper said it was never the kind of man who made plans for five years, "not even two."
"It's not at all motivating for me to have a map," he said.
"I have dreams, things you would laugh at if I told you," he said, saying but what he wanted from childhood was fulfilled.
At the age of 40, the actor acknowledged that he sees himself in the near future as director, taking the model of Clint Eastwood, who has taken over the leadership at this age.
Ponta, accused of uncontrolled slander and irrational claims
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto condemned hard Wednesday morning the statements of Roman Prime Minister Victor Ponta according to whose political decision makers in Hungary are "with nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which refugees flee".
"Yesterday, Victor Ponta lost his self-control and, through his irrational statements, offended Hungary as a whole," said Hungarian Foreign Minister in a statement.
Civilised European politicians don't say such uncontrollable slander.
"His remarks have only one explanation: he has lost his full support in Romania's domestic policy," added the head of Hungarian diplomacy, according to MTI.
In a Tuesday evening post on Facebook, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said he wants to draw attention and sanction the behaviour of high Hungarian government officials, who, in his opinion, "are a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union".
I do not want to respond to the challenges of Hungarian government representatives.
"This is a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union; and in anti-Semitic attitudes, and in terms of the treatment of minorities of all kinds, and now during the refugee crisis!" said Ponta on Facebook.
The Roman Premier added that he is committed to rational and sustainable solutions in the case of the refugee crisis, appreciating that brutality and aggressive laws will not solve the problem.
Shampata sarma, aggressive laws, prisons and brutality will certainly not solve the problem - they will only show that in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, they are political decision-makers with nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which refugees are fleeing!
"I believe in solidarity, in rational and sustainable solutions and especially above European values - what we see in recent days in Hungary is in complete contradiction with these objectives and values!" stressed the head of the Roman executive.
Previously on Tuesday, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto described as "simple lies" the remarks of Roman Prime Minister Victor Ponta on the management of Hungary's refugee crisis, appreciating that these statements are inappropriate for a 21st century leader, according to MTI.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy also referred to Tuesday as the "extremist and lying remarches" of the Romanian Prime Minister in the internal political crisis in Romania and specified that Budapest is waiting for an apology from the Roman side.
Szijjarto referred to a statement made Monday by Prime Minister Victor Ponta.
What I've always said and said is that I'm against xenophobic speeches the idea of closing the borders, that all who come are terrorists, they're the fools of the Middle Ages and I'm totally opposed to this approach.
If we can receive more, we will receive, the problem is our logistics ability to treat those people like some people, not how our Hungarian neighbors treat them with bat and insert.
"I disagree with that," said the head of the Roman executive, at a press conference in Targu-Jiu.
On Tuesday, Peter Szijjarto announced that the Government of Budapest has decided to begin preparations in the field for the extension to Romania of the fence that it builds on the border with Serbia, to face a possible change in the route used by migrants.
Next, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said that Hungary's decision to lift a border fence would solve nothing of the refugee problem and "Hungary in Europe".
What is the connection between Osama bin Laden and the crash of Mecca?
Saudi authorities announced that Saudi giant Binladin Group, belonging to the family of Osama bin Laden, is "partially responsible" for the collapse of a macarale on Friday in Mecca's Great Mosque, an accident after which 107 people died.
According to a committee of inquiry, the company did not "respect the safety rules," the Saudi press agency (SPA) reported, reports BBC.
The company's directors were banned from leaving the country until the investigation was completed in this case.
Also, the firm will be excluded from new public contracts.
The construction firm is owned by the family of former leader of the Al-Qaida terrorist network, Osama bin Laden.
The company was founded by Osama bin Laden's father 80 years ago and is currently headed by former terrorist leader Bakr's brother.
Binladen Group has been working for 4 years on the expansion of the Great Mosque, to be able to host more pilgrims.
The accident occurred on Friday night, during a storm, when a crane, probably unbalanced by powerful gusts of wind, collapsed on the ethical side of the Mecca's Great Mosque roof.
Following the accident, 107 people died and nearly 400 were injured.
How Hagi shut his mouth to the contestants
Considered by many the world's greatest Roman footballer in history, Gica Hagi was labeled after the withdrawal of the activity, as a weak coach, who cannot be able to perform performance and in the new position.
After unhappy experiences with the national team, Stara or Galataray, Hagi took over, a year ago, the role of coach at the Future Constanta, the team he is sponsoring.
After a year after taking over the team, the King has shown that he is capable of transforming a team that was struggling to save from retrogradation into a top.
Thus, after a year, the Future recorded, with the Coach Hagi, 16 wins, 11 remixes and 11 infringements.
Bilant is one of a top team, beating at European Cups.
Things took a better turn for the Future this season, since the team arrived second in League 1, with 19 points, one less than the Astra Jurgiu leader.
The future also has the best attack in League 1, with 20 goals (equal to Astra), more than double than Stara.
On the other hand, even if it has brought more experienced players to the team, Hagi has continued the policy of promoting young people, and in the last period of the start team names such as Ianis Hagi or Hodorogea have appeared.
The club's policy made the Future a team to track for teams abroad, so Hagi sold 1.5 million euros this summer - Ianis Hagi (Fiorentina - 1 million euros) and Alexandru Mitrita (Bari - 500 thousand euros).
Along with Stara, the Future is the only profitable team in League 1, according to data from the Trade Register.
In the refugee crisis, Romania has played so far as a small country.
It's a legitimate strategy, but then you can't ask to be treated as the seventh country of the EU.
The great countries come with solutions for the EU as a whole, says Cristian Ghinea, member of the Steering College of the Roman Center of European Policy.
In an interview with Diare.com, Cristian Ghinea showed that Europe cannot be transformed into a fortress, and the pure police means will not work in this crisis: "Maybe we have doubts about the quality of the values with which these people come."
But there are masses that have started and we can't go back to history.
Migration is a reality to which we have to adapt as best and adapt them to us.
In Cristian Ghinea's opinion, we are at an extremely emotional moment when politicians feel the need to show their muscles.
After he passes, Europeans will not be willing to give up free movement, but the rules in the Schengen area must be changed: "Schengen is now a creature created in another era and not adapted for the situation now".
Where are we in the refugee crisis after this JHA council that actually solved nothing?
It is clear that the EC president agreed with Donald Tusk did not want to strengthen a vote in the council.
All the predictions said he would have had the necessary votes.
Before the Treaty of Lisbon, the principle of unanimity applies in JHA and any State could block any decision.
That is why things have been very little integrated in the field of justice and home affairs.
After Lisbon, the normal procedure, in which the EC has the initiative, and the Council approves it by the vote of 55% of the states, i.e. 16, representing 65% of the EU population.
The calculations said the votes existed.
But they didn't want to go ahead.
Because it's a sensitive issue, rejection reactions have emerged even in Germany against Chancellor Merkel's opening policy, and they didn't want in many countries to appear as an EU-type reaction sending migrants to our heads.
So they've come up, but the problem remains because obviously this wave creates a huge problem for the Schengen government and we'll probably see big changes there in the next period.
So the mandatory quotas weren't really eliminated, but the subject was just let it cool off?
Yes, on the other hand, we are talking about a greater involvement of the Frontex agency in the management of external borders, which means a change from the individual responsibility of members at the external border of Schengen to the responsibility of Community agents.
The Greek border with Turkey is also the border of Germany with Turkey, in fact, and this wave of migrants has given the limits of the old Schengen system.
Perhaps he will give up the Dublin principle, according to which migrants are the responsibility of the state where he first enters, because he is not sustainable.
If Greece captures, you can't say to infinitely that it's Greece's business.
Problem and common.
Just because the problem is common, is it possible to resolve without a precise, perhaps even mandatory, mechanism of sharing the receiving effort?
No one knows exactly how the mandatory quotas will work, if they get to them.
Because there remains a problem: what do you do with a man who does not want to come to Romania or Portugal, but to Sweden or Germany?
I don't think the European states are going to take over the migrants: you're going to country X or country Y.
It will probably reach some unique filtration centres, in Greece or Turkey, where asylum applications are processed.
They're working on solutions like that.
But the problem doesn't have a simple solution.
There are countries that have decades of experience trying to integrate migrants, they are countries without any experience, such as Romania, where the problem of migrants will increase the xenophobic current.
It is certain that we are talking about millions of people who are in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, who are in precarious camps and who have just begun to leave for Europe.
An estimate says that only 10% have started to leave, winter is hard to get past the Mediterranean, but we're expecting next year at a wave maybe even bigger.
What do we do with these people?
My prediction is that we'll get used to this problem, we won't look at it so badly in the media.
You were talking about the country with less or greater experience.
Does it seem to you that there is any place where it has really succeeded in integrating large groups from an extra-European culture?
I'm looking at Maghrebs in France, Turks in Germany, they're still enclaved.
I wouldn't go to radical statements.
Of course their integration is more difficult than in other waves of migration, but that doesn't mean they don't integrate at all.
There is still an unintegrated part that creates major social problems in France, Germany, Britain.
But purely police means won't work.
Creating Europe's fortress is illusory.
The integration mechanisms in European societies need to be addressed.
Here were some mistakes.
We have to be more pretentious.
Let us ask these people to learn their language, to try to take the values, not to be left with one foot in Europe and one in their country of origin, bringing the rest of the family including through convenient couples.
However, the imminent problem of these people's long-term problems of their integration must be separated.
If others have failed in long-term integration it does not mean that we have to look at them as they drown in the Mediterranean.
Maybe we have doubts about the quality of the values these people come with.
And if there's going to be an intervention in Syria, which I don't think, it doesn't mean it's going to be going back to the country overnight and you can take it back.
Until the solutions appear, we see fortresses in Europe.
Borders are closed, walls are raised, border controls are re-introduced into the Schengen area.
Is the European project in danger?
The European project as such does not, the Schengen area as it was built, yes.
It was built quite minimal and setting the rules so that the pressure was too high on the countries where I set foot for the first time these migrants.
I mean, we're just walking around there, but everyone's in trouble.
In front of such a wave it can't be so, because some countries don't face it.
When there are such waves of emotion, politicians want to show that they do something, but in the long run there is no big change.
After the attacks in France, we do not have much more dramatic anti-terrorist legislation in the EU than we had last year.
It's a wave of public emotion that settles in both ways.
And it's so unstable from one week to another that you can't make decisions on her basis.
We have a lot of talk, a lot of bellicose statements from politicians at home under pressure to be virile.
And then you have the dramatic case of the drowned child in Turkey and public opinion gets excited.
After the public emotion passes, we will return to the reasons why we created this space, this freedom of movement that is not only for humans but also for goods.
This is the only real European market.
And I don't think Europeans will give up this principle of freedom of movement.
There'll be other rules.
Schengen is now like an animal created in another era and which was not adapted for the situation now.
How has Romania played so far in this crisis?
Like a small country, who thinks that if she pulls the bag over her eyes and clogs her ears, the theme disappears.
In front of the reality of the waves of migrants, you can choose to be part of the solution or say it's not your little country problem.
That's what we did, it's a legitimate strategy, but then you can't ask to be treated as the seventh country of the EU.
You're not, you're not playing high country.
Great countries come with solutions for the whole EU, good or bad, we are not now discussing their quality.
Just like Poland did.
On the other hand, the effect of this crisis is that the appetite of the Romans for Schengen will greatly diminish.
President Iohannis says it's probably good that I haven't already entered.
So we're moving from desperate entry to a more pragmatic position, but the goal remains.
There is of course a risk if Romania and Bulgaria enter Schengen as migrants to see us as an alternative route.
Which doesn't mean it's a reason we don't enter Schengen anymore, but let's be more pragmatic.
Romania will be part of Schengen, and Schengen will exist, but transformed into the sense that external borders will become common responsibility, there will be unique rules of acceptance of migrants, single rules of deportation for those who do not receive asylum, single rules for countries considered safe.
The Ukrainian president said that after Russia moved its attention to Syria in Ukraine no one died anymore.
Is there a connection between the two seals, a game of Russia?
Russia has a frustrated power behavior.
She thinks it's great power to mess with Americans and Europeans.
From this point of view, yes, there is a connection.
Without the military and financial effort of the Putin regime, the Assad regime would probably have collapsed long ago.
And it was good to collapse before the main opponent was the Islamic State.
About two years was a struggle between the Assad regime and the moderate secular and Muslim militias, supported by the Gulf and Western countries.
Then the Islamic State rose and now we don't know if we want the Assad regime to fall.
Russia was able to complicate things, but it can't participate in the solution.
It creates focus of instability and chaos that can't close.
But you're great power only if you have solutions.
The off-side game is just a strategy to make time.
Maybe Putin's waiting to make offers, push him on buttons to fix the situation.
The offers don't come because the world isn't convinced that he can sort out some way or other issues created by him all.
But I disagree with the theories that say these people are led by an invisible hand.
Let's not see a little stronger than it is.
What button will appear soon
Millions of Facebook users have gotten used to the "Like" button, and now the representatives of the socialisation network are preparing another opposite, the "Dislike".
Tuesday, Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and executive director of the company, announced on the account or that this button will soon be available, informs the New York Times on the blog.
Zuckerberg specified that the "Dislike" button will rather show a shade of what a user feels than a simple option.
However, the announcement or raised the problem that Facebook might become a less friendly place.
Zuckerberg mentioned that he wants to avoid the moments when someone posts on the account or an important event in life, and someone else will give "Dislike".
Network users, who have reached 1.5 billion active accounts, have long called for the opportunity to express their negative emotions or empathy with something sad.
Mark Zuckerberg has said that it is not very comfortable for people to give "like" current events, such as the refugee crisis, or in the event of a death of a family member.
"You may not feel comfortable giving that post like," said Facebook representative.
The variant of a new button on Facebook was not well received by everyone.
"There is already enough hate on Facebook and social networks," commented Atiq Haneef from Afghanistan, on the New York Times Facebook page, where the article was posted with this subject.
"I'll give 'Dislike' to the 'Dislike' button," said this.
Roger Anderson, a microbiologist from Atlanta, claimed that there is nothing wrong with this button, encouraging people to have different opinions on Facebook.
Debra Aho Williamson, social media analyst at the eMarketer company, mentioned that it is hard to imagine that a single button can transmit a complex range of negative emotions.
Moreover, she supports, the election campaign is approaching in America, and the "Dislike" button would create a total disaster.
Only 70 refugees entered Hungary in 24 hours
Hungary accepted only 70 migrants on Tuesday, one hand of thousands coming to the table at its southern border with Serbia, announced government adviser Gyorgy Bakondi.
Hungary declared its state of emergency during the day in two county along the border with Serbia due to the flow of refugees, closing a major border crossing point and announcing that it will build a fence at its border with Romania, recalls DPA.
The measure attracted a sudden reaction from Serbia.
Just yesterday they said they'd seal the border for those who want to pass, but not for those who want to ask for asylum.
"As you can see, this is totally different," Serbian refugee minister Aleksandar Vulin said.
Prior to the imposition of the new immigration legislation, a record number of 5,809 migrants entered Hungary on Sunday, the police announced on Monday.
More than 170,000 immigrants from the Middle East and Africa also patrolled Hungary in Serbia in 2015.
Many avoid being registered and try to reach the West, especially in Germany.
The "new" seat of the County Council stands to sting.
Two builders, in insolvency
The massive investments made here in recent years, with a view to moving the institution, are being crushed because they have been stopped several times.
Two important builders who worked here went into insolvency during the works.
The County Council headquarters in Vasile Alecsandri Street will end up crashing alone.
At one and a half years after the building's consolidation and rejuvenation work had to be completed, the works had not reached half.
One final stage in the building era was consumed last days when the National Dispute Settlement Council (NCSC) rejected a complaint from the company that wanted to take over the contract for the implementation of the technical project for the further works to be carried out.
The initial project was designed by Impex Romcatel SA.
Following the insolvency of the manufacturer and the interruption of the works, negotiating procedures were initiated without the publication of an announcement of participation with Impex Romcatel, the firm to update the technical project and then to organise a new tender for works.
"The negotiations were not completed by a contract, however, considering that the proposed form would have disadvantageed the institution," summarized Răzvan Timofciuc, representing public relations within the JC.
The CJ decision to interrupt direct negotiations was brought before the courts by Impex Romcatel.
The outlaw court sent the complaint to CNSC, which rejected it as late as possible.
This does not mean, however, that CJ can start looking for another designer.
Impex Romcatel has the possibility to attack the CNSC decision at the Court of Appeal, only after a final sentence of it being able to consider finding another designer.
Thus, building-building work could be resumed as early as next year.
Our intention is to start the work as soon as possible.
In principle, the renovation of the technical project should not take long, but we must reach the conclusion of a contract.
"We wait to see if the CNSC decision will be attacked or not," Timofciuc said.
Work on strengthening the former police headquarters started in 2011.
A first work contract was terminated in April 2012, after works of 4.5 million lei had been carried out.
The tender was resumed, the contract being awarded by Moldoconstruct SA.
However, the firm entered into insolvency, and this contract was terminated after 1.5 million lei had been paid.
The work has been carried out so far in proportion to approximately 50%.
Initially, the consolidation, refunctionalization and atmosphere of the building had been assessed at 7.7 million lei.
"All right, I say everything!" - the statement that could incriminate the former head of the Register
One of the employees involved in the scandalous file at the Register Office signed an agreement to acknowledge the facts, against a delay in prison.
Most likely, his statements will incriminate the other defendants, in front of the former chief, Narciza Nedelcu
A counsellor at the Office for Real Estate Registration and Advertising (OCPI) accused of DNA in a file of corruption recognized itself as a fap tele.
The Agreement on the Recognition of Facts signed by Dumitru Destălu was registered yesterday at the Iași Court, the judges establishing a solution in this case on 29 September.
Daniel Dsălu was accused of lying intellectually in continuous form and agreed to execute two years in prison with delay as well as work for the community.
With regard to Dsălu's alleged acts, prosecutors have stated that he, as advisor to the Register Office, together with other colleagues, "has forged several false acceptance minutes, by selling the prior key supply contracts by O.C.P.I. Iasi with the administrators of the SC Gauss SRL, SC Group Five SRL, SC Topo Euro Cad SRL, SC The Agency as a Destru and Topographies SRL and PFA Lipșa Ştefan, which falsely testified that the contracted services were carried out entirely, under conditions under which they were not carried out and not submitted to O.C.P.I. Iasi".
Last days, the former head of the Office, Narciza Nedelcu, but also other former or current employees of the OCPI were sued in this file, the charges being the settlement of services to the aforementioned companies, although the works were not carried out.
Prejudice exceeds 300,000 lei.
Adventures in Stone Age
In the opinion of President FRH, Alexandru Dedu, Romania can host a major handballistic competition only in 2024, and the preparation of the national women's handball to qualify at the Olympic Games costs a fortune.
President of the Romanian Handbal Federation, Alexandru Dedu, said yesterday, during a press meeting, that it is a great pride that our country has three teams in the Champions League groups.
As regards Romania's national women's handball team, "the main objective is to qualify for the Rio Olympic Games, but for that it must pass from two stages of cadine forks, first of all the World Championship and secondly the prequalification tournament," Dedu said.
We really want to qualify for the Olympics.
These are some fantastic requirements from the technical staff led by Tomas Ryde.
Staff that will be composed of seven or eight people.
He wants a second coach, a doctor, two men, a porter coach, a physical trainer, a head of delegation.
They asked us to get qualified things, more precisely materials for physical training, which I've never heard of.
These are all to get to the Olympics. And I'll do whatever it takes for me to have them.
We're talking about a massive investment, there's a lot, a lot of money.
But this is the way to make performance.
Because right now we're in the Stone Age with the preparation.
"The teams we beat have these materials and have some time," said Dedu, who mentioned that he is trying to get the necessary amounts to purchase these products from MTS and COSR.
President FRH also referred to the infrastructure in Romania and to the possibility of our country hosting a major handball competition.
We don't have a room in Bucharest.
It is a problem of infrastructure and it is shameful to be asked a European Gyms Championship.
Let's not forget that in other corners of the world, entire Olympic neighborhoods have been built in a two-year period.
Before 1992, in the current Olympic area of Barcelona there was a garbage dump, and now there has been a landmark of beauty.
The same was true in London, where the 2012 Olympics was a success and investment perspective.
"In my vision, in 2024 we can host a major competition," said Dedu.
He added that international handball bodies are willing to grant Romania the organisation of a major competition.
For me it is a priority to bring major handball competitions to Romania.
Mr. Gaţu went civilized with a project, people agreed in principle, but they quickly explained that the hall would never be built.
And I had discussions with EHF, I told them we wanted, that we were able to organize and they said they agreed and invited them to the first game in the new room in Bucharest and then we discussed it concretely.
"So we have all the openings, and at EHF and IHF, but we don't have infrastructure," explained FRH official.
The former great handballist avoided evaluating the chances of women's teams CSM Bucharest and HCM Baia Mare to arrive in Final Four: "I have asked all coaches to be booked in predictions, that if they don't come back against them".
Good road to the World Cup
Romanian Rugby starts on September 23, against France
The captain of the national rugby team, Mihai Macovai, said on Tuesday at a press conference that all Romanian Lotteries members are prepared for the World Cup matches in England, where they hope to win two victories: "We are ready".
Both me and my colleagues are with the engines at full speed.
We trained to do our best in the four games.
Everyone will have great expectations, because our goal is to win in two matches, against Canada and Italy.
All the groups are heavy and ours is the same.
Let's take it easy, first time with France and then we'll see.
But surely, if we win with Canada, the match with Italy will be our final.
I can't describe in words the joy of participating in the World Cup, it's the celebration of so many years of work.
I wish I wouldn't disappoint anyone in the rugby family and come with nice results at home.
"We want you to be proud that some players, a small family like rugby in Romania, proudly represent the tricolor," Macova said.
Romanian National Team Selection, Lynn Howells, first experienced as a coach at the World Cup, hopes to make Romanians proud of the rugby selection: "It is a great honor for us to participate in this World Cup."
I'm sure the players are ready to take part in the tournament.
It's an extraordinary experience for me.
For me it is very important that every match make Romanians proud of the national team.
The president of the Romanian Rugby Federation, Haralambie Dumitraș, is confident that Romanian players can confirm the progress made in the last few years in rugby.
We have a very difficult group and we want to confirm the progress made on the national team.
I wish sportsmen success and I have the conviction that we will be at the height of the event.
"These boys started playing in Romanian teams at 18-19, so there's cohesion, there's a band of friends, who set themselves to realize a dream," Dumitras said.
At the World Rugby Cup in England, Romania will move to Group D with the following scheduled matches: with France on 23 September in London; with Ireland on 27 September in London; with Canada on 6 October in Leicester; with Italy on 11 October in Exeter.
The competition starts on Friday at Twickenham Stadium in London, with the English-Fiji match in Group A.

14 million lei give the hospital "Sf. Spiridon" from Iasi to budget rectification
What will be purchased with this important amount of money?
The "Sf. Spiridon" hospital received approximately 14 million lei from the Ministry of Health, following budgetary correction.
The money that the medical unit has received to use until the end of the year will be invested in the modernization and construction of clinics, but also in equipment and medical technique for which the hospital has already begun the public procurement procedure.
Thus, the sanitary unit will be equipped with a new tomograph computer, with a new radiology apparatus, with six kits used for surgery, six beds of ATI equipped with appropriate equipment, ophthalmogenic microscope and other necessary medical devices.
On the other hand, 5 million lei of the hospital's money will be directed to the construction and arrangement of the "Mare del Ars".
From the money from the budget rectification, UPU will receive 500,000 lei to complete the modernization work in the main section.
"In addition, the following days we will be doing the reception of the work from the gateway linking UPU to cardiology, hepatology and gastroenterology clinics to ensure the decent transport of the UPU disease to neighbouring clinics," the manager of the medical unit explained.
The hospital will soon have in the yard and the Dermatology Clinic of Tatarași, which it will organize in the outpatient clinic, in the same form as it currently operates.
The clinic will operate in the area where there is allergy, hematology and endocrinology in the outpatient clinic and will have about 30 beds.
Iash, made to laugh by RATP controllers and a pleat.
The land of a tourist
A family of tourists from Cluj came to Iasi to visit him, but the trip ended with a bitter promise.
After the experience, neither I nor my wife ever want to step back in your city.
Without wanting to, they were hit by the wrong information in the folds, the failure of the RAPT controllers and, bonus, a fine "as the law says."
The wives arrived in Iasi a few days ago, stayed in a hotel in the center and asked for tourist flats.
They also got a fold where the RATP tracks were past.
"Armed" with these maps, the husbands visited the Iash.
But two days ago, when they were in Copou, they wanted to get to Palas Mall.
Because it wasn't a ton of tickets at the station near Copou Park, they relied on the information printed on the fold: that I can take the ticket via SMS.
No one told them that this service was gone.
Trusted in the fold, they got on a bus and tried to text after the instructions on the fold.
Unfortunately for them, a team of RATP controllers came up.
They said there was no service for two years and they announced in the press that they had cancelled.
From where do I know what was written in the local press, I came one night before visiting the city?
I talked to the controllers, explained the situation, said they didn't care, it's none of their business.
The attitude was very challenging.
They said all I can do is give us one fine instead of two (my and my wife).
"I paid, I didn't want to ruin my day visiting stand at the gendarmerie and giving statements there!" tells Ovidiu.
In conclusion, the family was amended due to incorrect information on the fold and controllers who "implemented the law on blood".
It's not fair, and I did a session at RATP Iasi to get my money back.
It's not about money, I'm not too much, but the point is, I felt wrong.
Bad luck for the rapists in Vaslui.
They had an accident and remained in preemptive detention
The trial of the seven rapists from Vasului moved to the Court of Appeal of Iași yesterday.
The judges of the outlaws tried the first term of trial at a non-public meeting where the seven young people accused of mocking an 18-year-old asked to be released.
Before the actual commencement of the trial session, one of the judges of the country whose file was distributed, Viorel Munteanu, made an application for abstention, which was admitted by his colleagues from the court.
The judge activated until the summer of this year at the Vasului Court, where he was the president of the National Section, who, on 9 April, admitted a challenge made by four of the defendants, ordering their detention at home.
Currently, the file is judged by a complete one of which are part of the Maricica Little and Geta Sandu.
Previously, in the file he formulated an abstention and Judge Dan An ton, because his daughter is in a cohabitation relationship with one of the lawyers of the rapists.
The two judges decided that the rapists from Vasului still remain in preemptive detention.
You will be incarcerated for at least 30 days, when you judge the children will be able to release them.
The next trial period will be held at the Court of Appeal of Iasi on 6 October.
Before arriving at the Court of Appeal Iași, the van with which the rapists from Vasului were transported was involved in an accident produced in the neighborhood of Pascurari, the car entering Iași on the belt.
Iveco's self-utility with which the seven rapists were transported struck a Volks Wagen car park that had come out of the street of Canta, and the driver tried to turn left.
The van circulates from the end of Easter.
The car entered Iasi this way because the staff of the Penitentiary Administration preferred the route from Vasului to Iasi around the Gardens, then on the belt road.
They thus shorted the road a few kilometers away.
Immediately after impact, the escort of the detainees called for another transport to take over the detainees.
In a short time, a car was sent to the accident site from Iași Maximum Security Penitentiary, who took the seven detainees and transported them to the Court of Appeal.
After the accident, none of the detainees were injured.
To transfer them to the other van, the guards surrounded the back of the cars, and the arresters stepped out in a speed, two and two.
"The incident has not been reported to the police, as drivers of the U.S. motor vehicles have amicably understood the damage to be paid," said Chief Commissioner Medalin Tăranu, IPJ.
Major migrations
Romania is not and will not be prepared for what follows.
What about Europe?
I say it from the beginning, clear and clear: the 7000 refugees that should and must naturalise Romania represent, in itself, a insignificant number, but huge in comparison to the capacity of the Romanian state to manage such a project.
For Romania, even the voluntary quota proposed by Bucharest, in the amount of about 1500 souls, far exceeds the good intentions of solidarity with the European Union expressed in recent months.
Certainly, if those migrants really agree to settle in our localities, the chances of quickly integrating them into Romanian society are extremely small.
I'm sure they'll be the first to lose their patience.
Parasited by interlopes and paralyzed by a venal political class, the Romanian state proves impotent in all areas.
The inability to integrate the gypsies is just a trivial example.
In addition, governments of any color have not been able to absorb European funds, make roads, kindergartens or modern schools, ensure decent health care, gather dirt on the street, create honorable paid jobs or keep their own young generation home.
Why would refugees be established in another country from which they are fleeing?
But what makes a lot of wonder is, in particular, the hypocrisy with which such a crisis is treated.
We are first struck by the belligerent foetus of the strong states of the EU, which show maximum generosity when it comes to sharing problems with smaller countries.
Then comes the fearless hypocrisy of Romanians who, although they have millions of relatives scattered all over the world, do not yet accept the other - of another language, of another religion, of another blood.
He's probably afraid he won't steal from anyone's national being.
Finally, there is also a hypocrisy of many migrants, who, although only invoke the horrors of war as a reason for departure, accept no destination of exodus other than Germany or the Nordic countries.
Now, not all refugees are Syrians, and in Pakistan there is no war.
Also, the simplistic way in which the crisis is analyzed can only be taken down.
The causes need to be eliminated, some support and, by placing strictly on the book of political justice, demand peace and investment for migrants' countries of origin.
But in Romania there is peace and even more, from time to time, some foreign capital in the national economy - but that does not prevent tens of thousands of Romanians from leaving their country each year.
Why is he leaving?
In this crisis, the European Union has revealed itself to us as an ankylodged, disbanded and out of the way.
I deplored the fact that Romania is not able to invent a country project, but that neither the EU has any plans for the future.
And improvisations and threats don't help anything.
Then, what use is the EU, if the only advantage enjoyed by Romanians - the right to free movement - could be questioned because of the waves of refugees crossing the borders like cheese?
At some point, the war in Syria will be over.
Not the migrant crisis, however.
Over the next decades, overcrowding, poverty, climate change, resource depletion, etc. will push millions of desperate migrants, especially from Africa, into a better life.
With such politicians, Romania is not and will never be prepared for what it will follow.
7,000 euros a year to rent the Club Pogor.
The destination, practically, imposed
The concession tender shall cover a period of 10 years.
After 7 years of being closed, the club in the Romanian Literature Museum court is offered by the Judicial Council for concession for a period of 10 years.
Construction has a useful surface of 134 sqm, on two levels of hrubs.
CJ accepts as destinations given to the building only those of literary coffee, bookstore or other activities with cultural profile.
The building was evaluated at 68,300 euros, the auction start value being 6,830 euros per year, with a tendering step of 25 euros.
The concessionaire will have to continuously and continuously operate the building and fully cover the costs of rehabilitation of the building in accordance with the technical project to be drawn up.
"The Club Pogor building is in an advanced condition of degradation due to the fact that during the period during which the public food unit operated and subsequently the evacuation of the plant, there has been no current repair and maintenance work as required during the operation of a building," is mentioned in the documentation relating to the tender procedure.
The club's concession offers are expected by 18 September.
Two brothers in Tomesti swallowed sleeping pills.
They were taken to the hospital.
Two 9-year-olds, 11 years old from Tomești, brothers, swallowed several Diazepam pills.
They found the pills in the house and took them out of curiosity.
Their mother was treated, and the drugs weren't hidden.
The children were taken urgently to the "Holy Mary" hospital in Iasi.
They're stable, as doctors say.
A meeting that breaks your heart.
At 20 years of age he received a brave gift: biological parents
Lost in the hospital under unclear conditions, in the dark of the '90s, when she had only two months of life, little, sick and helpless, and then adopted by a foster family in Italy, in the same years when adoption was vaguely regulated, a young outcast, now a beautiful and blonde girl, met in Iasi with biological parents from a village of the county, after almost two decades when no one knew anything about the others.
Crina will fulfill 20 years ago, and her adoptive parents in Palermo thought of offering their beloved daughter an amazing and courageous gift: a visit to Romania, to Iași, to get to know her unclear past.
"The newspaper of Iași", who attended the search for the family of origin after some extremely vague clues, witnessed these meetings that basically break your heart.
Reporting of reporters, the emotions of the moments, the statements of those involved, their reactions are moving and overwhelming.
The story of Crina begins 20 years ago in the island town of Ruginoasa, when she was only two months old.
Then, because of a health problem, the girl had to be hospitalized in the city.
Home there began to be misunderstandings between parents, and my mother was forced to leave the house.
He decided to keep the girl and send me home.
She stopped the girl, and since then I've known nothing.
"When I found out she was in the hospital, it was too late," recalls Alina, the girl's biological mother.
Crina was hospitalized with her grandmother at the municipal hospital in Paccani, and still the girl's father, Costica Balkan, went to work in Alexandria, Teleorman County.
Their lives were to be separated permanently.
They never found Crina in the hospital.
After admission, Crina's father went to work in another town, and returned after six months.
Meanwhile, the girl was transferred to the hospital in Iasi, and the father, when he came back, never found her again.
I think it's been almost nine months since the girl was in the hospital.
"I thought she was abandoned," tells a niece of the family.
Because of financial problems, Grandma couldn't come with Crina to Iași, and the girl stayed in medical care.
Because no one has been interested in the fate of the child all this time, it was taken over by the Directorate-General for Social Assistance and Child Protection Iași, who then gave it to care for the Placement Centre in Bucium.
There were years when abandonment and adoption were lighter regulated than today in Romania.
At the Bucium Center was found by the Italian Salvadore and his wife, a couple in Palermo who wanted to have their child but did not succeed.
They fell in love instead of the blonde Crina, and after some time this would definitely move with them to Italy.
The little girl had already been for almost two years, as long as the adoption formalities lasted.
When I saw Crina, I felt like she was our girl.
"As if my wife had given him life," says Salvador, the adoptive father, as he catches up with the girl's wild hand.
In the country, the parents of Crina, Alina and Costica continued their search separately, each where they could.
The father asked the authorities of Ruginoasa, but he didn't get any answers where his child might be.
The police then told her that she might be dead, but the parents found out what really happened to their daughter.
When I looked for her here, they told the court that she was going to Italy to Palermo.
And the conditions to look for her I've never had before.
We prayed to God to be okay.
I've been thinking about her all those years, but there were no possibilities to walk, to find her.
"It's hard," she tells us tears in the eyes of the biological mother of Crina.
But even if the years have passed, the parents of Ruginoasa have not been forgotten.
In Italy, Salvadore and her wife explained to the girl where she came from and that her past links her to Romania.
I was small when I found out.
I think I was five or six.
I reacted like a child, I was curious.
"I wanted to meet my parents in Romania," said Crina, delighted.
And her dream was about to come true.
In March of this year, Chief Romanian Commissioner Ichim, Director of the Regional Centre for Prevention, Evaluation and Anti-Drug Counseling Iași, was contacted by an Italian knowledge that explained Salvadore's desire to find the biological family of Crina.
And the search only started from a name.
After the request we had from our partners in Italy, we started our first steps.
I just got a name, Cosic Balkans, then the town, Ruginoasa.
Soon I had an activity with the city hall there, and I was able to ask if there is a local name.
Then they gave me some clues, just that the person found wasn't the one they were looking for.
"It took about a month to find the girl's biological father," explains Chief Romance Ichim.
In total, more than three months have taken the authorities to find Costica and Alina, especially that each had his home in another town.
We started the march somewhere in March, and in June-July we completed the identification of biological parents and discussions.
"Then we decided that a first meeting would take place in September," Ichim added.
In the weekend that passed, Alina and Costica first saw their lost girl in the hospital halls in Iasi 20 years ago.
Father, moved, could hardly control his tears, and his hands trembled relentlessly.
He's barely changing a few words with the people around.
A week before he met, he couldn't even sleep.
She was all excited, trembling.
"To see your child after all these years, it's something," one niece tells us, coming with Costica from Ruginoasa.
The encounter of Crina with her biological mother and brother
In discussions with his daughter, who is going to study at a well-quoted university in Italy, Costica Balkan told him, among other things, that if he ever wants to return to him, in the village, to come quietly: he can give him something sheep, goats, to find a boy in the village and hang a household.
Mom's also excited, crying, and she hardly thinks that something like that could happen to her.
I'm very excited.
I didn't think anything like this could happen.
I've seen such cases on television, I've been thinking about these years, I've hoped, but I didn't think I could be like that.
They're very big emotions.
If he could forgive me.
I hope we visit in the future.
"I hope we can keep a connection," she says with great tears on Alina's cheeks, the mother of Crina, while holding a napkin tight in her hand.
In it she hides her tears, happily, because soon she will see herself with her face after so bitter for so long.
On the other side, Crina, who will only be a few days old, this month, 20 years old, tries to calm down like an emotional child.
She doesn't know what to expect, but she sketched a vague idea about her biological parents.
He thinks they're young, but now before the meeting he's trying to gather his thoughts, because he has a lot to say, but nothing to blame.
My parents are two mothers and two fathers.
But my parents are finally the ones who raised me.
It'll be a beautiful meeting, a wonderful experience.
"I hope I have a beautiful memory with them, because now there are so many things to say," Crina confesses.
First family meeting in Iași
In the Union Market, under the autumn sky, the family in Ruginoasa once again unites their destiny with their daughter in Palermo.
Crina is 20 years old, finishing high school, after the Italian school model, but can start a new chapter with Alina and Costica, her biological parents.
They don't separate borders or countries, but only one barrier: the language barrier.
Over which, with the help of a translator, an Italian local owner in downtown Iash, passed easily.
Those who have managed to make this meeting possible say it is the first such event done, and that, in the future, if the opportunity comes up, they will do it again.
It's the first event of this sort organized, of such emotional loading, and I'm glad to be successful.
We, in the Centre, have different activities, and we are often associated as an institution that deals only with consumers, drug addicts.
But we're trying to get companies back something good.
"If I'm asked for such an event again, I'll do it with great love," says Romanian Ichim, director of the Regional Prevention, Evaluation and Anti-Drug Counseling Centre Iași.
Behind him, the Balkan family, with Crina in the middle, are walking away telling.
I understand: they have a lot to tell each other.
Armoured with guns to the foot yesterday at the PSD.
Everybody's pulling their soul.
The camps in the exit branch of the PSD have closed a gun-to-leg truce.
After successive rounds of discussions, held from Friday to Sunday, the first and most tense, PSD leaders agreed to temporarily suspend hostilities.
Pressed by the party's executive president, Liviu Dragnea, to present a united position, the outgoing social-democracy will send him a full list of potential candidates to the party's functions.
Far from being over, the party's internal war seems to have only taken a break to allow the fighters to take their soul.
Love didn't give an ultimatum.
He has launched a very simple and very current message under the conditions now: try to find a solution not to endanger the party.
On October 3rd, we have a party election.
All functions will be made available to those who want them.
"Until then, we remain in the existing structure," said interim mayor Mihai Chirica.
The two days of discussion on the weekend only led to the conclusion that nothing certain has been established.
At the October elections, a fierce competition is expected for the president of the county branch of the PSD.
On the short list of potential candidates at the main function of the exit branch of the party are State Secretary Maricel Popa, Senator Florin Constantinescu, Senator Sorin Lazar, county councillor Vasile Quantea and interim president of the Judicial Council, Victorel Lupu.
The mayor of the municipality Schitu Duca, Mihai Mihalache, could also be added to these.
A variant taken into account is also the candidacy of the leader of the PSD county councillors, Cristian Stanciu, if Lupu will no longer be in the race, sources of the party claiming that he is not interested in the function.
The only name that has not been mentioned by any of the participants in the negotiations of the last days is that of the former head of the subsidiary, Mayor Gheorghe Nicita.
The list of candidates is open.
Under the statute, even on election day, candidates can be filed, and no one would be surprised if it happened.
"It's important that we stay together, and we'll stay together after 3 October, when we have a new Executive Office, a new Permanent Judicial Office and all new management structures," said Quanta.
Until the internal elections are organised, the head of the county branch of the PSD will be assured by Victorel Lupu, a close to Nicita and Stanciu.
However, Lupu is on leave until September 29, preparing the elections to be practically assured by the branch's executive secretary, county adviser Mihail Popescu, in cold relations with Nichita camp.
Contacted by telephone, Cristian Stanciu appreciated the discussions of the last few days as leading to "a partial consensus".
There is a wide availability to maintain balance and unity in the party.
A partial consensus was reached in support of a unit team to deal with the county.
"But on the other hand, there are several variants of the intentions related to the candidacy of PSD Iași, the list remaining open," Stanciu commented.
An outlaw judge refused the file of the rapists in Vasului on the grounds of concubinage
The seven young men in Vasului County convicted of rape arrive today at the Court of Appeal Iași.
Vasluiens sentenced to punishment between five and eight months and eight years and four months today will submit their arguments on their release, after the substantive court, Vasului Court, has established their imprisonment immediately after the sentence has been handed down.
The file was registered at the Court of Appeal at the end of last week, Judge Dan Anton making a request for abstention, accepted by his colleagues.
Anton invoked that one of the defendants' lawyers, lawyer Bogdan Luca, is the concubine of his daughter, lawyer Dana Anton.
Luca defends Silviu Ovidiu Burada, the one who received the greatest punishment in this case.
How the judges motivated the sentence
At the end of last week, the judge of Vasi County who condemned the seven young people motivated the sentence.
In motivation the judge talks about the infidel reaction of the defendants, but also those who supported them, pointing out that such attitudes create a strong sense of indignation among the public.
"The Court finds that, after placing local relatives and supporters of the defendants, a strong sense of indignation at the local and national community was felt at the time of the pre-emptive measure of judicial control, restrictive but non-custodial measure of freedom, under the impact of the defendants' attitude, of their families and local supporters, that the accused are being judged to a lesser extent," the Court of Vasului said.
The magistrates also removed the main defense of the seven defendants who during the trial invoked that the girl they raped would not be the "door of the church".
"The court stresses that the moral quality of the injured person is irrelevant, which the defendants wanted to highlight by the defences they have formulated, since a person's physical and sexual freedom cannot be violated under any pretext," further stated in motivation.
Corbyn, Brexit and the future of Europe
Because of economic and demographic causes, the prosperity enjoyed in the last decades cannot continue the same in the following years.
Until Saturday, few people knew who Jeremy Corbyn is in Romania.
Even today, after he became the new leader of the British Labour Party, many wonder how much can affect our choice of a politician who, after all, is not in a decision-making position.
Jeremy Corbyn is the most radical leftist leader of post-war workers.
Marxist declared, anti-monarchist (he asked Tony Blair, then prime minister, to remove the royal family from Buckingam Palace), a fierce anti-American and a sympathizer of Vladimir Putin (he was also regularly invited to comment on political events by the Russian Today television channel), and terrorist movements Hizbollah and Hamas, he wants Britain to renounce nuclear weapons and leave NATO and the EU.
For Corbyn, who considered the killing of Osama bin Laden as a real tragedy at that time, ISIS is almost preferred by the United States.
Following the pattern of all populist demagogues, Corbyn has, of course, miraculous anti-austerity solutions.
Things like what he said and promised Tsipras in Greece until he gave birth to the real world and economic laws.
The new Labour Leader's economic programme provides, inter alia, massive renationalisation and the printing of money as a solution for financing development projects and covering very generous social benefits.
Sure, some might wonder why the money printing solution is not unanimously adopted on the world, then we would have a global prosperity! but who else should prevent such details.
Of course, we can charge bankers with blood, become some kind of left-wing enemies, but from what has been seen so many times in the past, not only in the former communist states or in Ecuador or Venezuela, but also in France, at the beginning of Mitterand and Hollande's mandates.
The additional amounts are quickly swallowed by generous promises, without cover, made by populist demagogues.
As Margaret Thatcher pointed out, "the problem of socialism is that at some point the money of others ends."
A few give Jeremy Corbyn a real chance to ever become prime minister.
In the early 1980s another radical left leader, Michael Foot, who was not as strong in conviction as the party's fresh leader, failed sadly in the elections.
And then there is still a working class in Britain, in the classical sense of the word, relatively consistent and structured.
And the unions were more sensitive than they are now.
Under the new industrial landscape, in which services are dominant throughout the workforce, and extensive automation has made it necessary for the industry to have a massive skilled workforce, Corbyn's rhetoric has a limited appeal.
But even from the opposition, he can influence important developments that can directly affect us.
In its last issue of the Financial Times, Corbyn's election increases the chances of Brexit, respectively, coming out of the EU.
The new Labour leader was a consistent opponent of the country's membership of the Union.
In the eyes of the radical left Brussels is the agent of international capitalism and a promoter of globalization that imposed austerity on the poor.
When you combine this kind of ideas with those expressed by the radical right, with the rhetorical anti-immigration and look at the refugee crisis that shakes from the EU ground you reach an explosive mix.
And not just for Britain.
But if the British decide after the referendum, which would take place by 2017, to leave the Union the loss of symbolic capital for the whole European project and the deep flaws created within it in the Euro crisis and now that refugees, between the North and the South, between the East and the West, leave room for the most worrying scenarios.
More and more for a whole series of Member States, London was a contradiction to the Franco-German axis (in which Berlin is becoming more and more the dominant actor anyway).
It is true, the British business environment, the City, are strong lawyers for staying in the EU.
But today's Europe is no longer the one in the past.
There are many resentments, which are growing in intensity even these weeks.
The problem is that Brussels, I have just recently had a sample in Jean-Clude Junker's speech, tends to make major decisions over the head of the large majority of Member States by consulting only a few European powers, mainly with Germany.
And this is happening under conditions where electoral support for anti-system formations, anti-immigration that are both at the same time and Eurosceptic is growing spectacular across the continent.
In other words, the emotional climate with negative loads has reached higher odds than ever before.
From where and the conclusion that Financial Times draws when assessing Brexit's chances.
The pro-EU option is based on a cool calculation that departs from the national interest.
If voters make the decision, then Britain will remain in the EU.
But Corbyn's victory reminds us of the power of emotion in current politics.
However, Eastern Europe can be significantly affected by such major developments.
Especially if, as expected, we will see a more pronounced integration of the euro area, which will push most of the countries in the region and the periphery of interest and that of the decision-making process in Europe.
Corbyn, Tsipras and Syriza in Greece, Podemos in Spain, even Bernie Sanders in the United States is fueling its populist rhetoric from the frustrations accumulated in Western societies.
From economic and demographic causes, the prosperity enjoyed in the last decades, the generous social benefits, cannot continue the same in the following years.
Under the explosive pressure of the dual crisis, the Euro-immigration area, both caused by early decisions that took only the integrative political ambitions, the capacity and availability of peoples and governments in Europe to respond to such challenges, the turbulence on the continent, the internal tensions in the EU will increase in intensity and may affect the situation of Romania.
And it's hard to exclude something from the possible scenarios.
The question is whether our main political leaders are able to cope with such complicated situations.
Constantin Brancuși, the peasant god.
Rockefeller: "How can I help you?"
Whites: "Take and sew the workshop!"
The great sculptor had a great dream: to be someone, to be famous, to hear about him all over the world.
Behind his fame, however, is something almost forgotten today, when millions of successful stories are delivered, prescriptions for success in life.
That thing has a name.
It's called a trout.
What do you write about Constantin Brancuși?
What else is there to say, actually?
His figure appeared on the bills.
And recently, a well-known bank in Romania hired an actor to play it in an ad.
Bunches produce and deliver money almost 60 years from the time he's gone among us.
In Romania, there are hundreds of streets and boulevards that bear its name.
In addition, even the author of this text lives on one of these streets.
And when he comes out with odrasla, he hears the following instructions: "We go to the park, to the Brâncuși".
The country is stocked with its statues.
There are few Romanian personalities whose works are known by so many people, from children, to the elderly.
Brâncuși's infiltration capacity is a huge one.
Neither did the Communists succeed in removing it from Romania's memory and culture.
His quotes are now spreading the Internet, receiving hundreds of thousands of likes and shares.
And then, again, what else would it be to say, to write about this man?
Looking at a bunch of books and articles trying to reconstruct his destiny, Brâncuși's life seems almost fantastic, totally improbable.
You know, there are those people who tell you that if you weren't lucky enough to be born in some big city and in a family how strong your chances of success in life are almost zero.
The life of Brâncuși is the perfect example.
And maybe here would be a key.
Maybe this should start the next text.
With a sentence, however detestable these are.
Look at the success stories of idiots, which are delivered to you daily in newspapers and on television.
Look closely at this man's figure.
You want to know how he made it in life, how, today, did he hear a whole world map?
It's simple.
He worked his whole life to be someone.
That's what he did.
Constantin Brâncuși was born on February 19, 1876, in Hobita, a small village in the Municipality of Pestișani, Gorj County, on the banks of Carpathians.
He is the fifth child of Mary and Radu Nicolae Brâncuși.
Although it came from a raised family of peasants, Brâncuși leads a modest life, but one of which will collect its landmarks that will guide his late artistic vision.
Remembering his childhood and the places where he grew up, the artist had to confess, in a meeting with Petre Tutăa, Paris, in 1933: "Life was then beautiful and harmonious".
For millenniums, people were leading, happy, a patriarchal life.
Everything went from one season to the next.
And you know why things have changed?
The civilization of the great city has reached us.
But Brâncuși's childhood was far from an idyllic.
One of the moments spent in these early years of life is extremely suggestive of the combination of purity and violence that characterized the future sculptor of the years spent in the hometown.
The moment is reproduced in the work "Brâncuși. A biography", written by Alexandru Buican.
In 1879, Constantine Brancuși was 3 years old.
In the fall of that year, when the "cazan" was being made, following those who taste the liquid to see if the process goes right, Brâncuși caught a moment of general non-attendance.
He fills his palms with gnawing and drinks unsuckingly.
It falls into sleep almost instantly.
The first people barely notice after a few minutes.
My mother panicked, then hysteria, thinking her son died.
At night, when the father, Radu, returns from the living accompanied by the wrestlers, he sees from far away the desperate signs of those who await him with their soul to their mouth.
The party immediately turns into a wailing.
The father is already thinking of burial.
However, someone finds it good to call Baba Brandsha, doftoroia and maids of the Brancas.
The cheese checks the child's breath, then puts them under the horse's broom nose, gathered around.
The child sneezes strong.
The world applauds.
While the boy is allowed to sleep further his drinking, joy, the fight party continues with even more force.
The next day, the father and son meet through the livade.
Radu Brâncuși makes Constantine gather some nuts and bring them to him.
The father puts his baby under his head and, with the nuisances brought by the boy, beats him to remember.
And while feeling the sting of the blows, the little Brancuși has the revelation that the world can be looked at from a different perspective and that the things around can appear overturned.
Especially the position of the sun, different from the one well known, makes him wonder, as he would admit to old age, unless the astro participates in his disorder himself.
Had the sun also been as troubled as his father of what had happened to him?.
At the current time, the city does not work
A parliamentarian appeals to politicians to remind them of those who voted for them.
Independent deputy Viorel Blojuţ appealed to PSD and PNL to end internal struggles and to redirect its agenda to the electorate.
What we see now on our political scene is a great dissociation and so on.
I didn't see anything of the USL projects in 2012 that would continue.
Neither highway nor Regional Emergency Hospital, see only how politicians dispute their possible locations according to real estate interests.
Let's just put aside a little bit of politics, get together and talk.
At the current time, the city doesn't work.
"If you're busy with the internal war, you don't have time for those who chose you," Blojut said.
He appreciated that the current political class had disappointed the outcast, the consequence of which being a very small presence in future local elections, around 30%, representing practically the faithful electorate of the parties.
The Member also believes that voters will always turn to traditional parties, expressing their reservations to new political initiatives, such as the "For Iaș" party that will be launched today.
Local parties have very small chances and will only break from the right electorate, not from the PSD.
Such parties are based on active civic people, who are usually on the right.
"It crushes even more right, which is not good for anyone, nor for PSD," said the Blizzard.
He stated that he is not interested in an application for future local elections, dissuasing rumors of his intention to join the City Hall race.
I also said I don't want to run for any local office.
I still wonder if you will continue as a Member and in the future term.
I tried to appeal to the Iasi unit and in discussions on the halls, with the other MPs, and I was accused of wanting to picture myself.
