White pedone to f3, black pedone to e6, white pedone to g4, black woman to h4 - crazy chess! This is jokingly indicated in chess circles as "foolish matt".
White: Tower in a1, pedon in b6, king in c8. Black: pedestrians in a7 and b7, king in a8, affiere in b8. White puts the opponent in the zugzwang playing the tower in a6, after which Black has only two options: take the tower in a6 or move its affire in any other chess on the diagonal b8-h2. In the first case, the White makes its pedestrian advance from b6 to b7 and gives mad chess. In the second situation, the white tower takes the black pedonal in a7 with the same result.
