We waited for him yesterday.
Tom said Mary was low.
Where's the exit?

I have to try.

They talk very fast.
Tom was lucky at first.
It's urgent to go to the bathroom.
Mary really looks like her mother.
He didn't have the money to buy the farm.
How often do you go to the movies?
Are you religious?
Did he talk to you?
Are there many sharks around here?
Tomorrow, if God wills, we'll be with your parents.
It's coming from Sweden.
He didn't have the money to buy the farm.
Did you really believe that?
Tom decided to sell his car.
I don't like fish with lisches.
I feel protected.
You're the tallest.
Isn't this funny, Tom?
Tom was born on 20 October.
It's a nice picture.
I'll leave her alone.
Tom won't even look at me.
We humiliated them.
He's already here.
I know who my enemy is.
Tom needs to sleep now.
Tom's not honest.
Tom's father is a cop.
Tom works here?
That's what Tom was looking for.
What did you do to her?
Tom wanted to send a message.
I wasn't happy to see them.
Don't break my heart.
I don't have plans for tonight.
Stop being sarcastic all the time!
She was crying.
I wish I could be rich like you.
We had fun.
It's dishonest.
I often read books.
Tom and I want to talk to you about something.
I can meet you at 2:30.
Tom's pissed off.
I'm old already.
I've got the dirty feline.
Good night, my friends.
I bought a book in English in a bookstore.
I'll go to the bookstore tomorrow and buy some books.
What would the world be without women?
They tell us funny stories.
Can you hear what Tom's saying?
What is your favorite historical movie?
We can't see her.
Tom and I still love each other.
Tom needs to eat.
Everybody go.
Giant pandas only live in China.
I'm coming along.
Don't say such things.
It's getting worse!
Jim is Canadian.
You did good here.
Where did all the others go?
I'm relaxed.

He entered his private life.
Can I borrow your knife?
I'm late for an appointment.
Tom's still missing.
I ate all the apple.
Drag the bhakri while the pot is heated.
Is the park open today?
We only prepare uighur food.
We're leaving for Boston tomorrow morning.
We can't leave you there.
Tom was playing football.
Stop whining.
I know her.
The real heroes are us.
We're waiting for Tom.
Unfortunately my birthday is only once a year.
Put your bike away.
I meant it as a compliment.
They called President Roosevelt pirate.
I could go to the movies.
It's not an appointment.
It makes me nervous.
Who do you think told them?
Why did Tom give it to Mary?
Listen to her!
He's good at this game, isn't he?
Take care of them.
I dress in the Fiji Islands.
You want to eat with us?
Doesn't sound too surprised.
I'm not going to school on Saturday.
It's my job to protect you.
Tom's an infidel, isn't he?
Is this cage intended to protect from sharks?
Tom wants to get to know Mary better.
I'm very disappointed.
Tom wants more coffee.
Who do you think is the author of this novel?
I wish you'd called me.
You don't want a job?
I played the trombone when I was younger.
I'm faithful.
Can you write in Braille?
I don't know what happened to him.
I'm free today.
Why do you want to kill us?
He ate an apple.
I caught him.
He adopted the orphan.
I guess they speak French.
Take a step forward.
You need to get more active.
Are Tom and Mary kidding?
She broke her smoke.
I don't have any alternatives.
I think Tom knows who lives in that house.
He's smarter than him.
What will you do this summer?
He got pissed off.
Can you speak Shanghainese?
He narrowed down because I washed him.
Tom was wearing an old pair of shoes.
Tom wondered what happened to Mary.
Something bad happened to them.
How much was paid?
They didn't touch anything.
Do you like horror movies?
I know a lot about animals.
Don't hold your breath.
Am I in London?
She's still there with her, right?
This will make a big difference.
Tom didn't have much money with himself.
Tom doesn't have a big appetite.
Were you with them that night?
I was running.
The village was dead after sunset.
What's your favorite rapper?
Say hello to Tom for me.
It's nice to see you so happy.
I usually swim in summer.
Why is he leaving soon?
I'm pretty proud of it.
I smell gas.
I'll tell them it's not true.
Here's your picture.
I can depend on my friends.
The experiment confirmed his theory.
Tom's lucky.
Give me the ketchup, please.
It happened that I sat next to you at a conference.
There's no furniture left in the room.
Tom showed up early for class.
He's a little overweight, isn't he?
Who's the man playing the plan?
I decided not to do it again.
No, I haven't written it yet.
You have to listen to Tom.
He slept in the car.
Tom and I are going to Boston with Mary.
He spends all his drinks.
Search harder on Google!
It's not the only problem with your idea.
You talk like you're the boss.
You want me to go with you?
I came to see her.
Does it look familiar?
I'll check your game tomorrow.
So, what am I supposed to tell him?
It's starting to rain.
Do you play any instruments?
Are they going to die?
I really like it.
Are you guys coming in?
Tom stabbed her.
I have no feelings.
She's incredibly stupid.
We're landed on a lonely island.
It takes patience.
She convinced the teacher.
When's your new novel coming out?
I would never betray her.
Are you aware of any problems?
The mystery remains unresolved.
I will never forget Germany.
Why didn't you call a doctor?
You're good.
How would you like to change it?
It's snowing today.
You promised to write me every week.
I wasn't born deaf.
We should leave you alone.
I can't raise our son alone.
Go get some milk.
Tom seemed surprised.
I love being right.
Tom married a rich Boston girl.
I forgot whether he drinks wine or not.
Who warned them?
Have faith in God.
"I will give 50,000 for this statue. "Who will offer more?"
Why would anyone want to kiss her?
He should have bought a used car.
I'm going to stay at the hotel.
I didn't grow up like that.
You can park here.
Please tell him to hurry.
Tom hated them.
I get used to it almost every day.
I won't apologize.
We really like picnics.
I haven't talked to him yet.
It was a hot summer evening.
I always walk.
It's decisive.
You're not much fun at parties, are you?
He searched his bag for the keys to the car.
I don't really want to talk.
So it must be Argentine.
I really like my job.
I'd suggest you be more prudent.
She's shaken.
He should have done it yesterday.
I'm a big fan of American cuisine.
Tom's dancing with Mary.
Your destiny is in my hands.
No, you don't have to go now.
Nobody wants to help you.
It'll clear in the afternoon.
He's blind.
We subscribe to a newspaper.
I thought it was a combination.
What do you imagine when you look at that picture?
How many continents of the world are there?
He's good at singing, isn't he?
Tom's mad at Mary, isn't he?
His idea is superior to his.
Tom never forgave me.
I'm the expert.
Tom has a secret.
We're losing blood.
Chaucer and Boccaccio are two writers. The first is English, the second is Italian.
Tom's getting emotional.
I was just scared.
Tomorrow's a party.
I had too much beer yesterday.
I would like to teach you Chinese in exchange for another language.
I'm still busy.
I appreciate your insights.
I went to the park this morning.
Tom loves fly fishing.
We have no choice but to risk it.
I don't want to play chess.
Mary is jealous.
I should have changed the oil.
Do you have a calculator?
I asked him to stay.
If you really want to know, all you have to do is ask.
We need to inform Tom.
Tom's still asleep.
Tom's a little impulsive, isn't he?
You agree with Tom, right?
Tom didn't take much money.
Tom calculated his expenses.
It's not my idea of fun, but as you wish.
Could you ask Tom to stop after work?
He plays the drum.
Must be hot.
Which online dictionary do you use more?
Turn on the candles.
We lived in Osaka for ten years before coming to Tokyo.
No one can solve this problem.
German machines are among the best.
Call them.
That's cool.

She'll get the camp.
He came to listen to jazz.
Do you really think Tom's beautiful?
I can't give Mary anything she wants.
When does school end?
Tom and I are pretty busy.
He hired me.
I said I'd take it.
I knew they were watching me.
I have plans with them tonight.
I could meet someone who can help you.
Do you know how to ride a bike?
These shoes are too small for me to wear.
I see a model.
She brought me a cup of tea without sugar.
It was published in 1969.
We just need to relax.
He speaks Chinese.
Tom told me he wanted to go to Boston.
London is smaller than Tokyo.
I'm three years older than you.
Look, I'll show you.
I said he was innocent.
Fear of failure is one of the most widespread fears in the world.
Why are you so jealous?
You think Tom killed Mary?
Why don't you have anything to say?
Scandalosis!
Come on, Tom, aren't you curious?
Keep your tongue shut.
I drank the wine.
He's more popular than me.
When can I get out of here?
You're back in advance.
We left this.
All I want is to go fishing.
You want to take this?
Tom didn't want to go back to the orphanage.
Gold is heavier than iron.
I'll find one later.
At least I'm older than you.
Tom didn't want to spend any more time with Mary.
Tom says he kissed Mary.
You can choose what you want.
I was hit by lightning.
Did you call them?
Shut down the radio.
Why did you decide to become a teacher?
It was a really scary story.
He's in the van.
I don't introduce them.
Do you like golf?
Forgive me for interrupting the other day.
Can you believe it? We're in Europe!
I was waiting for a bus to arrive.
He found the bug.
You'll never guess where I am.
I wasn't well.
You students have to be diligent.
I won't be able to help you.
It's a scandalous idea!
The sun disappeared behind a cloud.
You're interested in politics.
Many people go to church on Christmas Eve.
Thank you, my daughter.
I can't drive very well.
I heard Tom's learning how to drive.
She knows I love her deeply.
He's trying to commit suicide.
I don't need your help anymore.
The problem is that we don't know where Tom is.
It's under the bed, isn't it?
I knocked down the branch with an axe.
The minigons are back in fashion.
There are some books on the table.
Come at least six.
I've got a lot of work to finish by the weekend.
He forgot his name.
Are you Mary?
After dinner walk on the beach.
Why didn't you go with him?
It's two years bigger than him.
French is difficult.
I'm sure she's very busy.
My name is Ahmad.
You got the wrong number.

I've known him for over ten years.
We're grateful for the music he left us.
It's not that the idea of putting in a home an ammonia appliance attracts me a lot.
Judy is a very smart student.
We knew the dog would run after the cat.
I'm a cop.
You kissed her, didn't you?
Why don't I just buy you a hat?
I thought Tom would be alive.
She's beaten up with bad news.
This car doesn't belong to me.
Are you listening, Tom?
He often shows his anger.
Tom's my dad.
We don't have to leave yet.
Do you like the mountain?
My daughter likes to play with dolls.
Come on board.
She's charming.

I'm here to help him.
It's not easy to speak English properly.
I don't believe a word of what you're saying.
Get out of the way!
Only Naoko drinks coffee.
Sami needed to use the bathroom.
He changed his name.
You guys are vulgar.
Tom's getting better.
We can help them.
They called us.

The country is rich in natural resources.
It was a difficult beginning for Mary.
Tom won't be back today.
You again!
Why do these things always happen to me?
Birds are catching the ground.
The park is closed Monday.
Didn't you even update the firmware?
I have a job for her.
This is just a game.
Can we do it now?
They like all my friends.
I like my tongue.
Why won't you answer me?
We're Tom's classmates.
There's nothing better to do.
Tom started writing.
That's what I'm looking for.
He's practicing.
Are you coming in?
Which way should I start?
Did you study Darwin's evolution theory?
His horse had a heart attack.
It's worth visiting the ruins.
He should be ready for the worst.
Tom took his bags out of the trunk.
That reminds me of someone.
I'm so hungry.
Tom lost his new watch.
Tom sang with Mary.
Is that what you told Tom?
Do you remember his license plate number?
He told us a lie.
She has seven children.
We listen to music.
I think it's dangerous for children to play in the pond.
She bought me a nice coat.
The bell rang.
Take him to the men in room 318.
I'm falling in love with her.
We must postpone our departure.
Tom doesn't even care.
We were separated.
It's very soon.
You saved Tom's life twice.
I don't like big cities.
This happened to me.
He doesn't have a few friends in America.
I wasn't living in Boston last year.
Read this book tonight?
Tom has a car?
I'll be fine, don't worry.
Tom rarely laughs.
I can't forget his smile.
I disobeyed him.
Do you know any Canadians who live in Australia?
Tom's cute, isn't he?
I'm perfectly happy here.
Do you like it?
What exactly do you want Tom to do?
Listen, we need to talk.
Tom didn't like it very much.
Could you wash the dishes, please?
The lunch was great.
She turned off the computer.
Torture is against the law.
I remembered that.
It's not impossible.
What do you want me to do?
She had to share a bedroom with her sister.
I heard the door close.
He made him drunk.
How do you feel today?
Would you be interested in working for me?
It reminds me of my childhood.
Mary and Alice were like sisters.
Tom arrived in Boston last night.
You're stubborn.
I don't feel nervous.
She's got a good dog.
What do you really want to do?
Tom didn't even read Mary's letter.
They were perfect.
What are you guys planning on doing this summer?
You're going to my house.
But the fox with his swing has reached the quiet Fido.
Tom's engaged to my older sister.
My father always hangs in my private life.
Everyone wants something different.

I know you don't like them.
I didn't know about his plan.
Why don't you go back to Boston?
I don't want to be away from home.
What about going out for a walk after dinner?
Fight like a man!
Tom and Mary sing it?
Are Tom and Mary okay?
Contracting is common in markets.
They shot him.
Sorry about the inconvenience.
Tom was looking for his pen.
I don't want you to see this.
How many kidneys does a human being have?
A saved balance is a earned balance.
We're not cold.
We need to talk to him.
I know his name.
It's gone red.
Don't bother them.
We were good.
She started acting strangely.
You should ask Tom to help.
Who sent the flowers?
Do I owe you money?
Would you like me to go?
You left this, didn't you?
Tell us something.
You're random.
Please lower your music.
I train Tom for work.
He was watching him swim.
Who broke the vase?
You'd better go with him.

Tom didn't go, neither did I.
Would you like to leave a message?
The children played together.
Say it again, please.
You're disturbing her.
Sami's not here to ruin your day.
Take off my shoes.
I'm learning Esperanto now.
He hired mercenaries to kill Sami.
Are those yours?
The woman drinks water now.
Tom was a lawyer.
People here are demanding about what they eat, so even if a restaurant is inexpensive, it will soon close down if the food does not taste good.
The man they're talking to Tom and Mary is a lawyer.
He changed his diet.
He's a man of speech.
I'm free tonight.
Do you think I'm too tall?
What should we do now?
Tom proved a new technique.
Were you blindfolded?
Are you interested?
Tom cut his wrists.
You look relieved.
You should have kissed Tom.
I know I'm wrong.
I'm looking for my keys.
Will you join our club?
Don't fire Tom.
He's not listening.
I bought it in a used store.
Why don't you do it on your own?
He's finally here!
Tom thinks they'll all be here by noon.
Why don't you work with me anymore?
It doesn't mean anything.
You're lying.
She helped him.
Everyone was talking about it.
Are you telling me you're not busy?
He hates apples.
Go home.
Tom told me Mary was engaged.
Where's my money?
No one saw them do it.
Tom didn't read any of these books.
You're still inexperienced.
I have to go to work now.
You came too soon.
He can speak ten languages.
Come home before dark.
I got off the train to the wrong station.
I hated French to seniors.
Aren't you supposed to be home with your mother?
He has blue eyes and blonde hair.
I can't understand.
Tell him who you are.
My name seems weird.
I'll never forget that night.
Be happy! Add an exclamation point to all your phrases!
Can you see anything in there?
You're ready.
Why should I talk to them?
I won't forget.
I don't want to forget it.
I can't open it!
Tell Tom I'm innocent.
I bought myself a pair of shoes.
I started working here in 2013.
They're traitors.
I'll stay.
I'm not always busy.
I'll assist you.
I got up before dawn.
I'll be right behind you.
How long did you live in Kobe?
We're getting closer.
Tom always says the same thing.
Did you talk to Tom?
Try to get some rest.
Do you have a Facebook account?
He asked how to cook fish.
No one will believe his story.
Tom's a gold boy.
You seem to be warned against ideas coming from foreign countries.
I bought that book for him.
I wasn't going to hit Tom that hard.
She makes me sick.
I want a doctor.
What does the cat want?
You'll meet her tomorrow.
You're three years younger than Tom.
Complete the sentence.
The clock's broken.
I won't wait forever.
Just give the order.
Do you know Canadians who live in Australia?
This book is much more interesting than that.
We were obliged to obey the rule.
I hope Tom's not angry.
The rock was moved with dynamite.
Mary prepared breakfast.
Where did you meet my father?
Who was Mona Lisa?
He said he had to go.
You can keep them.
This smell is unbearable.
He became famous.
What are you pointing at?
I became friends with him while I was in Taiwan.
He was intimidated by his intelligence.
She's done the ball.
We have to go.
Staying home is not fun.
I'm sure Tom will be awake.
She can't find her hat.
Mr. Young would like your son to study more.
I opened an account in a bank nearby.
I didn't like that one.
Can you be sure?
It was nice to see you.
You don't have to worry.
We'll be close.
I'm really worried about them.
He clearly wants to go.
I knew Tom would do something romantic.
How much paper do you need?
Can you confirm that?
It was a waste of money.
Tom's talking to Mary on the phone.
Bring wine.
I was very proud.
You're very fast.
How about a beer?
I had no idea you guys were so stupid.
They're not alive.
I'm hiding in Japan.
You're a brave man.
Aren't you surprised?
It costs only one coin.
I hope Tom and Mary break up.
My spoon is too big!
Give them a moment.
Let's eat together tonight.
I don't expect you to remember.
Put the picture on.
You're my three best friends.
Have you tried talking to him?
Where'd you have lunch?
He's the last person who can tell a lie.
June too is not so far away.
Why does Tom hate so much?
You know who said that?
I'm going to bed early tonight.
He kicked me out of the house.
My shoes got wet.
The key was left in the room.
Are you leaving me?
You've always liked Tom.
Why do you care?
Give him a hand, OK?
You wanted to ask me some questions?
Don't play Tom.
You'll land on your feet.
I took risks.
Two people were killed in a road accident.
You know Tom, don't you?
It wasn't my idea to take them.
My grandmother missed her last night without suffering.
I know why you're angry with them.
You know Tom likes machines.
You passed the exam.
Tom imitated Mary.
I can easily read Spanish.
Should I use ink?
Don't fall out of the chair.
Tom sent us Christmas gifts.
Tom can't swim?
Children usually get up early at Christmas.
I'll be your guide.
How long do you study English every day?
Why does he look like he's weird?
I can't do anything for her.
Dad's good.
I think they're ready.
Tom will try it again.
What a wonderful woman!
They played a board game.
They all believed him.
It means a huge increase in the use of air conditioning, which uses energy, costs money and creates pollution.
I'm a drug addict.
Those are crocodile tears.
He might have said something earlier.
The job leaves traces on Tatoeba...
Do you like carrots?
I have pains every thirty minutes.
Tom's a lot older now.
Tom's better.
I think Tom's pessimistic.
You need to help them.
I write to my mother sometimes.
Don't trust anyone.
I regret never being nice to him.
Make Tom call me.
It hasn't changed anything.
She's not wearing her hat.
Tom actually apologized to Mary.
Why doesn't he sit with me anymore?
I want you to look for them.
I left the party too soon.
I should have eaten more.
Of twenty students, only one has read the book.
To love someone means to see it as God meant it.
Don't lie to them.
They live with her?
I don't know how he did this.
I'm not sure if George will like this idea.
They're afraid to say it publicly.
Please, identify yourself.
Leave us.
It would be nice to spend the summer in the mountains.
I lost it.
I almost dropped the plates.
There's a phone in my room.
Is it serious?
Tom made 911.
We're brothers and sisters.
Are you interested in Buddhism?
It was nice this week.
You want a tray with that?
She doesn't know me.
Nobody wants to work.
Please drive slower.
How do we do that?
This is last month's magazine.
They're not back yet.
He's about your age, isn't he?
It's backwards.
We can't let them die.
It's a bundle of nerves.
Tom was late.
Tom stayed back.
This will be discussed tomorrow.
How did you spend your holidays?
When he left the Army, Roger Miller moved to the country music house in Nashville, Tennessee.
Mary made it right.
Have you ever talked to him?
I think Tom won't be able to do it.
When did you get back from London?
Tom's always in a good mood.
Can I get you some coffee?
He left the village so he could study.
I've never seen you dance.
Tom leaned over for a closer look.
Can you save them?
So you and Hanna are thinking about getting married?
You can drive, right?
They need us to finish the job.
I've been here twice now.
It looks so fake.
They're all dead.
I don't want you in my car.
A cobra Morse Tom.
I don't care about you.
Don't say anything!
I think you're right.
He likes football.
Tom lives next to Mary.
I have to go to Boston next week.
Show them how to do it.
What is your favorite fruit?
Do you like golf?
What is your favorite type of pizza?
He's not very good at his job.
Bob's got a lot of books in his room.
Tom followed.
The ship disappeared on the horizon.
Of course you said a lie.
Something was going on.
Send it by mail.
It's interesting, isn't it?
Mary accidentally hit Tom.
I'm nobody's enemy.
I forgot his number.
The two teams fought very hard.
I think there's a mistake in my account.
Tom didn't convince me.
Sami had some painful secrets.
You want me to be honest?
What are you gonna do?
Tom seems tired, take him home, please.
May all your desires come true!
He's done it already.
He's experienced with a word processor.
He was at the death gate.
You're hurt, aren't you?
Your table is ready.
Will it be hot again tomorrow?
Tom and Mary have a car, right?
Now let's talk.
I can't solve this problem.
He hit him in the head.
It'll be very funny.
Tom told Mary what not to do.
Do your business!
She was extremely scary.
I'm telling a story.
You're homesick, aren't you?
What are you going to eat tomorrow?
I saw the movie first.
Sophie, who was hungry, ate everything she could get.
Are they Tom and Mary?
There is no future in his employment.
Tom and I often study together.
Tom and Mary are very happy here.
Do you like traveling?
I want to go back to Tom's.
He has strong principles.
He was buried in this cemetery.
Again, bye.
Lucky to meet you here.
Are you waiting for someone?
You're an overly optimistic girl.
Is this your umbrella?
I don't know three languages.
Tom said he was bankrupt.
We need to sleep.
We're in Calgary!
I'm strong.
The way you're doing it is wrong.
Tom says he didn't do anything wrong.
I speak English.
Tom and Mary are young and attractive.
I'm done watering the flowers.
Here's what to do.
Tom asked Mary out several times.
I tried to save her.
I'm not interested in your opinion.
This is my favorite album song.
I need to talk to him.
Tom will be so happy to see you.
I woke up thirty minutes ago.
Tom and Mary said they weren't Canadian.
I like poets like Takuboku.
Is that what happened with him?
She was too weak.

You look perfect.
I'm actually a bastard.
I don't want to sit next to her.
Look at that!

It is disease to be obsessed with victory, it is disease to be obsessed with the use of martial arts, and it is disease to be obsessed with presenting everything you have learned. It is disease to be obsessed with attack, and it is disease to be obsessed with defense. It is disease to be also obsessed with getting rid of the disease. To fix your mind obsessively on anything is considered disease.
