The Majelis (AM) Welsh is worried if they look like a muppets doll.
There is concern among some AM about a suggestion that their term should be changed to MWPs.
This arose because of the plans to rename the Majelis as Welsh Parliament.
The AMs all over the political spectrum worry if it can invite excitement.
An AM worker party said that his group was concerned, "That's unique to Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, Twp means crazy and Pwp means shit.
One member of the group says that his group is one unit, feeling "unpleasant" and has proposed some alternatives.
A conservative Welsh said that his group was "open-minded" about a change of name, but judging that this was a setback from the MWP mark to Muppet.
In this context you in Welsh are spoken as a letter u in English Yorkshire.
"The last decision on any explanation of what is meant for the AMs is of course a matter for the members themselves."
Wales ’ 2017 ruling power enabled the mayor to change his name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public consultation on the known proposals for broad support for calling the Assembly the Welsh Parliament.
On the issue of the so-called AMs, the Commission prefers the WMPs, but the MWP option gets the most support in public consultation.
The AM seem to propose alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus could disqualify the president, Elin Jones, who was expected to hand over the bill's plans to change in a few weeks.
These reforms will include other changes on how to work together, including discursive rules for the AMs and committee system plans.
The AMs will get the final voice about the question of what they should be called when they discuss the calls.
The Macedonian people went to give a voice to the referendum on the change of country names
The voters will decide whether their country names will be changed to "Northern Republic of Macedonia."
The most respected vote was held in an effort to settle disputes for a decade with the Greek neighboring country, which also had a province called Macedonia.
Athena has long insisted that the name of the neighboring country to the north shows a confession to her territory and has repeatedly rejected the offer of membership of the European Union and NATO.
President Macedonia Gjorge Ibanov, an opposition to vote for a change of name, has said that he will ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, felt that the change in the name was a price to be paid to join the European Union and NATO.
St. Martin's bells don't ring when the churches in Harlem are in trouble
"Historically, the parents I spoke to said there was a bar and church in every corner," said Mr. Adam.
"Today, there's none."
He said that the disappearance of all the bars could be understood.
"People are socializing in another way" right now, he said.
"But it's no longer a community guest room around where people visit it regularly."
As well as with the church, he fears that the proceeds of the sale of assets will not last long as the leaders expected, "and sooner or later they will return again from the beginning."
The churches, he added, could have been replaced by an apartment building with a condominium filled with people who wouldn't help keep the sacred places around it.
"Most people who will buy condominiums in these buildings are white people," he said, "and therefore it will speed up the day when these churches close together because it is impossible for those who move to these condominiums to become members of these churches."
The two churches were built by the white congregation before Harlem became the city of black metropolis - Metropolitan Communities in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original White Methodist Congregation moved in the 1930s.
The black congregations that have served in the surrounding area have taken over the building.
St. Martin was taken over by the black congregation under the leadership of Reverend John Howard, who led a boycott of the retailer on 125th Street, the main road to shopping in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote black people.
The fire in 1939 had caused the building to be severely damaged, but when Reverend Johnson's parish plans to rebuild, they built a tower bell.
Reverend David Johnson, Reverend Johnson's son and his replacement in St. Martin proudly calls the tower bell "Lonceng poor people"
An expert who rang the tower bell in July gave him another name: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable instrument of history."
An expert, Tiffany Ng from Michigan University also noted that this is the first tower bell in the world played by black musicians Dionysius A. Lind, who played the largest tower bell in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin didn't replace him.
What has happened in Santo Martin in the past few months is an architectural story and a complex contractor, some brought by a public church leader, and the others brought by the Episcopal diocese.
The western government, which was formed by the leaders of the public, wrote a letter to the diocese in July with concern that the diocese "will try to charge" on the westry, although the vestry is not involved in the recruitment of architects and contractors sent by the bishop.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency from the bishops.
Shark wounded teenagers 13 years of age in lobster rescue in California
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday when he dived to catch lobsters in California at the opening of the lobster season, trained an officer.
The attack took place before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with his friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy asking for help and then rowing in groups to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was just an escape of joy after catching the lobster, but then he "discovered" that the boy screamed, 'I was bitten!
I'm bitten!'
The whole cell bones are torn," Hammel said that he realized it when he reached the child.
"I cried out to everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!' Hammel added.
The boy was flown to Rady's Children's Hospital in San Diego where he was handled in critical condition.
The shark species responsible for the attack are unknown.
Captain Larry Giles Beach Rescuer said in the media conference that a shark had been seen in that area a week earlier, but it was categorized as a harmless shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered severe injuries to the upper part of his body.
Officials closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security purposes.
Giles realized that there are more than 135 shark species in this area, but most of them were considered harmless.
Sciencebury's plan broke the British beauty market
Sciencebury takes over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with a beautiful toserba-style kiosk run by specialist assistants.
As part of the substantial push towards the British beauty market worth £2.8 billion, which continues to grow while selling fashion products and household equipment decreases, the larger beauty kiosks will be tested at 11 stores across the country and will be developed into more stores next year if it proves successful.
Investment in beauty becomes a single hunt for supermarkets to use shelves that used to be used as a TV home, microwave, and household equipment.
Sciencebury said that it would double the size of the beauty offer to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The current brand line starts from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with a branded area like found in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also relaunched the makeup of its shop so that most of its products will be friendly to vegans - something that is increasingly appreciated by young merchants.
In addition, Fragrance Shop perfumer will test the concession at two sciencebury stores, the first opened in Croydon, south London last week, while the second will be opened in Sell Oak, Birmingham, at the end of this year.
Shopping online and switching it to buying daily food needs in small numbers at local grocery stores means that supermarkets have to do something more to persuade people to visit.
Mike Coupe, executive head of Sciencebury, has said that the marches will increasingly look like Mall when the supermarket chain tries to fight back the presses like Aldi and Lidl by providing more and more foodless services.
Sciencebury has put Argos' shows on hundreds of stores and has also introduced several Habitats since they bought both of those newspapers two years ago, which he said has supported the sale of daily food supplies and made more profitable acquisitions.
The previous supermarket effort to renovate the beauty and pharmacy department ends with failure.
Sciencebury tested the sculpture effort with Boots in early 2000, but cooperation ended after there was a conflict on how to share the profits of the chemical store in the supermarket.
New strategy emerged after Sciencebury sold 281 pharmaceutical stores to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy, worth £125 million, three years ago.
It was announced that Lloyds would play a role in the plan, adding a variety of fancy skin care brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sciencebury, said: "We have changed our views and nuances at the beauty kios-kios to improve the atmosphere for our visitors.
We also invest in trained colleagues who will be ready to offer advice.
Our brand line is designed to suit all the needs, the environment and the comfortable location that we are currently making a binding destination that challenges the long-term shopping."
Peter Jones 'carried' after Holly Willoughby pulled himself out of a £11 million worth deal
Star Dragons Den, Peter Jones went 'with excitement' after TV host Holly Willoughby pulled himself from a $11 million-dollar business-style deal to focus on his new contract with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time to manage the trademarks of household equipment and their accessories, Truly.
This couple business is similar to Gwyneth Paltew's Goop brand.
This morning's 37-year-old host uses his Instagram account to announce that he's out.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragons' star Den, Petes Jones is angry to pull himself in the last few moments, from their profitable business life style--to focus on his larger contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The source stated that Jones was so "movable" when the golden girl admitted during the exciting meeting on Tuesday at her business center office in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new deal - worth up to £1.5 million - means she doesn't have enough time to devote herself to the trademark of their household equipment and accessories, Truly.
Their business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltew's Goop brand and is expected to double Willoughby's wealth to £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37 years old, used Instagram to announce that he left Truly, Jones flew out of Britannia to one of his holiday homes,
One source says: "Truly so far is Holly's top priority.
It was going to be the long-term future, which would make it survive for decades to come.
His decision to stand down made everyone in the crowd feel terrible.
No one can believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch time.
There's a warehouse full of goods in Marlow's main office ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of this Morning, one of the most expensive British stars, can cost the company up to millions of dollars due to a large investment in product form, ranging from pillows and candles to home clothing and equipment, as well as the potential for further launch delays.
And this can mean the end of long-standing friendships.
The mother of three children, Willoughby and her husband and Baldwin have been very close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, aged 52, joined the lead in March.
This couple vacationed together and Jones had 40 percent shares on Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will be the ambassador branded for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of I'm A Celebrity's TV show.
A storyteller close to Jones said last night "We won't comment on this business relationship."
Speak seriously 'and then we fall in love'
He's joking about the criticism he's going to get from the news media because he's making comments that some people consider "non-presidential" and has been very positive to North Korean leaders.
Why does President Trump give up so much?
Trump said with a derision of his news reader.
"I don't give up anything."
He knew that Kim was interested in meeting the second time after the previous meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump praised as a step forward for North Korea's deuklirisation.
But negotiation negotiations have been halted.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, the highest diplomat in North Korea Ri Yong Ho spoke to the world's leaders on Saturday that North Korea did not see a "appropriate response" from the United States against the early movement of the North Korea weapons.
On the contrary, he noted, the United States continued its sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump looked more optimistic in the course of his speech.
"We do our best with North Korea," he said.
"If we fight North Korea.
Millions of people will be killed.
Now we have this extraordinary relationship,"
He said that his success in repairing relations with Kim has led to positive results - stopping rocket experiments, helping to free the hostages and returning the remaining American soldiers to their homes.
And he defended his unusual approach to talking about relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to be president, but compared to having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this terrible arena, we'd better have about 200 people standing there," said Trump, pointing towards the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami Indonesia and Earthquake Destroyed an Island, Killing Hundreds of People
As a result of the Lombok earthquake, for example, non-governmental organizations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the Lombok population lost their homes, there was no declaration of national disaster, as a pre-arrangement for international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they've made it clear that they don't ask for international help, so it's a bit challenging," said Mrs. Subut.
While Save The Children is setting up a team to go to the Palu, it is still unclear whether foreign staff can work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, the spokesperson for the national disaster relief agency, said that the Indonesian officials were reviewing the situation in the Palu to see if foreign agencies were allowed to contribute to the relief.
In view of the continuing shock of Indonesia, this country is still very unprepared to deal with natural anger.
While the tsunami shelter was built in Aceh, it was not a public sight on the other shoreline.
There were no tsunami sirens in the Palu, despite warnings of danger, most likely contributed to the loss of life.
At the best of times, the journey between many islands of Indonesia was very challenging.
Natural disaster makes logistics even more complicated.
The acuous hospital that has been located in Lombok to care for the victims of an earthquake on their way to the tree, but it will take at least three days to reach the location of a new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made repairs to Indonesia's infrastructure as the core of the election campaign, and he has spent money on building highways and rails.
But lack of funds has disturbed Mr. Joko's government while he is re-election next year.
Mr. Joko also faced pressure from the ongoing sectarian tension in Indonesia, where Muslim majority members have embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were displaced from their homes when Muslim and Christian mobs fought on the streets, using umbrellas, bows and arrows, and other sharp weapons.
Witness: Liverpool Player Daniel Sturridge inserts balancing goals against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat against Chelsea on the Premier League with a score in 89 minutes on Saturday at Stamford Bridge London.
Sturridge received bait from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 meters from outside Chelsea when his team left 1-0.
He put the ball on his left side before kicking him toward a distant pole.
The ball hangs high on top of the gallows when the ball points to the right corner of the net.
The ball finally fell through the Arrizabalagah's father who jumped and fell into the net.
"It's just trying to get into that position, to control the ball, and the players like Shaq always play it forward as much as possible, so I'm just trying to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and take one chance and don't think too much about it, and just kick it."
Chelsea led with a 1-0 score in the first half after Belgian-based player Eden Hazard scored goal in the 25th minute.
Attacker The Blue gave the bait back to Mateo Kovacic at the game, before spinning near the middle line and running fast into the middle of Liverpool.
Kovacic quickly give bait and run in the middle line.
He then made a perfect kick, leading Hazard towards the gallows.
Hazard managed to get past the opponent and kick the ball to the gallows with the left foot kick, past the Liverpool Alisson Becker's kiper.

The statue of the Cromwell Parliament became the last memorial to be followed by ‘rewriting history’
His expulsion will be poetic justice for the destruction of the veils against the many British cultural and religious artifacts made by fanatic Puritans.
But Cromwell's people described Mr. Crick's advice as "foolishness" and "trying to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, head of the Cromwell Society, says: "This cannot be avoided in the current debate about the destruction of statues, that figure Oliver Cromwell outside Westminster Palace will be targeted.
The British brother's war iconoclasm was not ordered or done by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell descendants would have been sacrificed for his ancestors' actions in the past century.
The extraordinary representation of Cromwell of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is evidence of the 19th century and part of the historiography of a figure still believed by many to be worthy of celebration.
Mr. Goldsmith told Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was considered by many people, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a parliamentary defender against external pressure, in case of course the kingdom.
Whether it's a completely accurate representation, it's still the subject of ongoing historical debate.
Surely that conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the development of the next nation, and Cromwell is a figure that can be recognized by individuals representing one side of the difference.
He is worthy of a celebration and a reminder."
Killer Pigs Hunting Chinese Farmers to Death
A farmer attacked and killed by a pig in a southeast Chinese market, according to the local media report.
The man, identified only by the name "Yuan", was found dead with a broken artery, covered with blood near a pig cage in the Liupanshui market province Guizhou, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines to pigs on a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in the Xining province of Qinghai, China.
He was reported to have gone with his cousin from nearby Yunnan province on Thursday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next day, his cousin found him dead, and saw the door of the pig cage near him has been opened.
He said that in the pig cage there was a big male pig with blood in his mouth.
Forensic research confirms that the male pig with a weight of 550 pounds has persecuted the farmer to death, according to the report.
"Betis my cousin was bleeding and destroyed," said the cousin who was known with the "Wu", as quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
Security footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The beast that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig was already locked up to prevent them from attacking others, while the police collected evidence at the scene.
The Yuan family and market authorities were reported to negotiate compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pig attack on humans have occurred before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing the man to be seriously injured.
10 years earlier, a pig weighing 650 pounds sticks a Welsh farmer to his tractor until the wife frightens and drives the animal out.
After a farmer Oregon was eaten by his pig in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive but can smell blood as a "enemy".
"They're just messing around.
They're biters, very curious to know... they're not going out to hurt you.
You just need to give him enough respect," he said.
The rest of Rosa's storms bring the rains to the southwest of the United States.
As an estimate, the Rosa storm weakened as it moved over the cooler waters on the north coast of Mexico.
In any case, Rosa would have rained all over Mexico’s northern and southwest parts of the United States a few days to come.
Rosa had a wind at 85 mph, Category 1 Storm, beginning at 5:00 a.m., on Sunday East Region time, and located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa may have moved north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, Palung began to form on the Pacific Ocean and moved east, towards the U.S. West Coast, as Rosa approached the Baja California on Monday as a tropical storm and began pushing the tropical rain northward to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring rain up to 10 inches in part of the Mexican region on Monday.
Then, the tropical moisture that interacts with the approaching eagle will create heavy rains in the West of São Paulo for several days to come.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous flooding, debris flows and possible landslides in the desert.
Low tropical humidity will cause the rainfall to be about two to three inches per hour at some points, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
Two to four inches of rain is estimated to fall in some parts of the West Power, especially in most Arizona.
A banrang flood could happen with a rapidly deteriorating condition because of the widespread tropical rain.
It is not recommended to explore the desert by walking on foot because of the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains can result in a violent river and a hurricane.
The approaching umbrella will cause local heavy rain to part of the coast of Southern California.
Total rain red that exceeds half an inch is quite possible, which can cause small debris to flow and the highway to smooth.
It's going to be the first rain in that area in their rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin approaching Arizona at the end of Sunday and Monday morning, before the rains become wider on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains would swell to four corners on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
In October, there will be some major changes in temperature throughout the U.S. as the Arctic gets colder, but the tropical area remains quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature within a short distance.
There is an exact example of a dramatic temperature difference throughout the U.S. central area on Sunday.
There was a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
For the next few days, the remaining summer heat will be formed and spread again.
Most of the U.S. central and eastern regions are expected to start warming up in October at an 80s-speed spread from the South to the eastern parts of the Sea.
New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is estimated to be about 10 degrees above average.
The long-term climate forecast showed a high chance for above average temperatures for the eastern U.S. until mid-October.
More than 20 million people have witnessed Brett Kavanaugh's trial.
More than 20 million people saw an interesting statement on Thursday by the upcoming Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused her of committing the alleged sexual violence in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
In the meantime, political failures continued, with publishers interrupting regular programs to report the unexpected events in the last few minutes of Friday: A deal designed by Senator Arizona Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a one - week investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Justice Committee that she was 100 percent convinced that Kavanaugh was drunk and tried to take her clothes off at the High School party.
Kavanaugh, in his fiery testimony, said that he was 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
Probably more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday have seen it.
The company counts the average viewers at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Calculations for other networks that broadcast this are not readily available, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually experiences difficulties in counting the number of people who watch him at the office.
To put this in perspective, it's the number of viewers almost the same as the football playoffs or Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose audience opinion strongly supports the presentation of Kavanaugh, is superior to all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers throughout the whole day, says Nielsen.
ABC holds second position with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has 3.1 million, NBC has 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million viewers and CNN with 2.52 million, says Nielsen.
The interest remains high after the trial.
Flake was a key figure in the play on Friday.
After the Office of the Modern Republic Party issued a statement that he would choose to support Kavanaugh, he was arrested by the CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning by the taste pointer when he tried to climb the elevator to the Justice Committee congregation.
He's standing down a few minutes when he's being insulted by maki, sent directly to CNN.
"I stand right in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think that he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told, "You have power when there are many helpless women."'
Flake said that his office had made a statement and said, before the elevator was closed, that there were many other things he needed to say in the committee congregation.
Cable TV and broadcast networks were all directly involved a few hours later, when the Justice Committee would choose to advance Kavanaugh's opinion across the Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do that with the understanding that the FBI would examine charges against the candidate for a week ahead, as requested by the minority Democrats.
Flake has been persuaded by some conversation with her friend, Senator Democrat Chris Coons.
Post a conversation with Coons and a few senators after that, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice has power, as it's clear that the Republican party won't have a voice to approve Kavanaugh without any investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accuses critic of playing politics on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accuses criticism of "playing politics" with the future of Britain and ruining national interests, on his plan to leave the European Union, in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, England, September 29, 2018.
In another interview, after one of the interviews showing him on the front page of the newspaper, former foreign minister Boris Johnson stressed the attack on what he called the Chequers plan for Brexit, said that the proposal about England and the EU that should collect each other's tariffs was "very unreasonable."
The Wayde Sims shooting: The police caught the suspect Dyteon Simpson in the death of the LSU player.
The police have caught a suspect in a fatal shooting that resulted in the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and in prison on a second level murder charge, says Baton Rouge Police Department.
The officer released the video confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said Sims lost his eyeglasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses at the scene and said that they found Simpson's DNA on the stuff, WAFB CBS affiliate reported.
After interrogating Simpson, the police said that he confessed he had made a fatal shooting at Wayde.
The contract has been set at $350,000, the lawyer reports.
Coroner's East Baton Rouge parish office released an advance report on Friday, saying that the cause of death was a head injury to the neck.
The department thanked the fugitives of the Louisiana State Police Force, the state police lab, Southern University police and citizens for assisting the investigation into arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the law enforcement of the area for "recognition and pursuit of justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
With a 6,6 foot high in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
The average point is 5.6 and up to 2.6 in last season's game.
On Friday morning, basketball coach LSU Will Wade said his team felt "damaged" and "surprised" with Wayde's death.
'This is what you worry all the time,' said Wade.
The volcano bursts ash in Mexico City
Abu is out of the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern part of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned the Mexicans on Saturday to get away from the volcano after activity increased in the grid and registered 183 emissions of gas and ash in more than 24 hours.
The center monitors the vibrations and vibrations several times.
The images on social media show a thin layer of ash sticking to the front glass of a car around Mexico City.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in the activity of volcanoes at 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital since the 7.1 earthquake rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
This volcano is known as "Don Goyo" that has been active since 1994.
Police clashed with Catalan separatist towards the election of independence.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the pro-freedom demonstration clashed with the anti-huru-hara police, and when thousands joined the rival demonstration to mark the first Catalonian polling ceremony on self-separation.
A group of pro-separatist masks held by the anti-huru hara police threw them with eggs and threw powder paints, creating dark clouds of dust on roads that would usually be filled by tourists.
Disputes also took place after that day with the police who used their rods to control the dispute.
For several hours groups of pro-freedom groups shouted "Don't forget, there's no forgiveness" against the workers' union pointers screaming, "Long live Spain."
Twelve people were treated for minor injuries in the protest, the local press reported.
Tension remained high in this free - oriented region, one year after the referendum of October 1, which Madrid considered illegal but celebrated by the Catalan separatist.
The voters chose to be free, despite the low number of electors with those who opposed self - separation and most of them boycotted the election.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the vote at the GST throughout the region in a sharp clash.
Pro-freedom groups have camped all night on Friday to prevent demonstrations in order to support the national police.
Demonstration continued but forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended a separatist protest with his wife said he no longer hoped for Catalonia's prospects for independence.
"Then we went through one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry in desperation because they could choose, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite having won a vital victory despite a little in the December regional election last, Catalan pro-freedom parties have fought to maintain this year's momentum despite many of their well-known leaders, who are in exile or in detention awaiting trial, on their role in organizing referendums and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42 - year - old mechanic who recorded a protest with his phone to support the police, said that the conflict had been triggered by politicians on both sides.
"Now it's getting more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who had been imprisoned for pre-trials since the end of last year, announced that he would run for election in the European Parliament next year.
"Standing up as a candidate for the European election is the best way to protest the decline in the values of democracy and oppression that we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.

The goal printed by Menga has given Livingston victory over Rangers with 1-0 score
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston is to ensure victory
Livingston's victory led the Rangers to fire Steven Gerrard from his position as the manager of the Iberian club, on both defeat in 18 matches.
Dolly attack has been evidence of a difference when Gary Holt's side movement is equal to Hibernian in the second order.
The Gerrard side remains without victory in this season's Premiership and faces the leader of Hearts who is eight points ahead of them, next Sunday.
Earlier, Rangers met Rapid Vienna at the European League on Thursday.
Livingston, in the meantime, extended their unbeatable record in division to six matches, while Coach Holt's head has still scored defeat since he replaced Kenny Mile last month.
Livingston lost his chance against a sloppy guest team
Holt's team was supposed to be superior long before they scored goals, with their accuracy giving Rangers various difficulties.
Scott Robinson managed to break through but failed to cross the gallows, then Alan Lithgow could only widen his efforts after launching in and against Craig Halkett's call from across the gallows.
The host feels satisfied to let Rangers play superior in the beginning, knowing that they can make it difficult for the incoming team to get the ball killed.
And that's how to achieve a very important goal.
Rangers broke free kicks and Livingston got a chance, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined to help Menga, who got a turn and scored from the middle of the field.
At that stage, Rangers have dominated dominance but realize that the host's defense cannot be breached and Liam Kelly's kiper is completely unharmed,
The pattern continued until the second round, although Alfredo Morelos managed to fish for Kelly's rescue.
Scott Pittman was cut off by the Rangers' foot Allan McGregor and Lithgow were removed far from the other Livingston game tactics.
The attack continued to come to Livingston's stable and continually allowed, while two criminal claims--after the Halkett challenge on Glenn Middleton's replacement players, and one for handball--refused.
‘Phenomenal’ from Livingston - analyses
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont by Tony Macaroni Arena
Performance and phenomenal results for Livingston.
For a man, they're amazing, they keep going beyond the hope of this ever - increasing journey.
Their playing and personal style has hardly changed since they went back to the top board, but big credit must be given to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He has so many champions.
Captain Halkett is very large, leading well organized defense, while Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall remain vigilant during the game.
Still, Rangers lack inspiration.
As good as they were at the time under Gerrard, they failed to meet that standard.
Their last ball was not good - only once they could break the formation of the host - and it was a warning to Rangers, who realized their existence in the middle of the field.
Erdogan received a varied reception in Cologne.
There was a smile and a blue skyscraper on Saturday (September 29th) when the Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan to Germany - which aims to improve the relationship between NATO allies.
They disagree about the issues of human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a new great mosque.
This city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police indicated security reasons to prevent the 25,000 gathered in front of the mosque, but many supporters moved around to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protests - many of them Kurds - also sounding, criticizing both, Erdogan policy and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The protest of resistance describes the confrontation of the existence of a visitor welcomed as a hero by some German Turks and reproached as a dictator by others.

Long Lartin Prison: Six wounded officers
Six wardens were injured in a riot in a man's prison with strict guard, the lap office declared.
The chaos occurred in HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire around 09:30 BST (GMT+0100) on Sunday and still continues.
Officer "Tornado" has been directed to handle the riot, which involves eight prisoners and takes place on one side of the building.
The officers were taken care of at the scene because of slight injuries to the face.
A prison spokesperson said: "Specially trained rest officer has been directed to deal with an incident that is taking place in HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six officers have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in this prison, and it is clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and may spend a longer time behind iron bars."
HMP Long Lartin prison housing more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous inmates.
In June it was reported that the head of the prison was treated in the hospital after an inmate attacked.
And in October of last year the anti-huru-hara officer was called into prison to deal with serious riots where a fireman was attacked with a bile ball.
Rosa Storm Threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with Bandang Flood
Tropic depression that hit Arizona rarely occurs, but that's likely to happen in the early weeks because of the energy footprints of the Rosa Storm left through the southwest desert, leading to the risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning that the floods were raging on Monday and Tuesday for West Arizona until southern Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa was thought to be heading straight through Phoenix on Tuesday, hitting on Monday night with rain.
National weather service in Phoenix mentions in twitter that there are only "ten tropical storms capable of causing tropical storms or state of depression in 200 miles Phoenix region since 1950!
Katrina (1967) is a storm within 40 miles of the AZ border area."
The latest storm center equipment is capable of predicting 2 to 4 inches of rainfall with an isolated amount of up to 6 inches in Mogollon Rim Arizona.
Other southwest desert areas include Rockies and Great Basin power stations are likely to be hit by 1 to 2 inches, with the likelihood of isolation reaching 4 inches.
For those in the unrestrained flood zone, Rosa’s rain may have been a blessing because the region was affected by drought.
Although flooding is a serious problem, some of this rainfall is likely to benefit from the current drought in the southwest.
According to the U.S. United States, only about 40 percent of Arizona's region has experienced some extreme drought, the second highest category,"weather.com reported.
First, the route through the Rosa Storm leads to the land across Baja California as the Mexico border
Rosa, still at storm power on Sunday morning at wind speeds 85 miles per hour, 385 miles north of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north at speeds of 12 miles per hour.
The storm met with the cooler waters in the Pacific, and that's why its power was weakened.
Thus, it is estimated that it will land in Mexico with the power of tropical storms on Monday afternoon or night.
Rain white may be high in parts of Mexico, causing a high flood risk
"Total red rain 3 to 6 inches is estimated to extend Baja California to southwest Sonora, probably up to 10 inches," reportedweather.com.
Then Rosa would cross the northern part of Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border on Tuesday early as a tropical depression, which would cross through Arizona and south Utah on Tuesday midnight.
"The main risk that Rosa storms might be facing or the rest of the storms is the very high rainfall in Baja California, the western region of Sonora, and the U.S. southwest desert region of the U.S.." National Storm Center (NHC) states.
The rain is expected to cause the flood and debris of buildings flowing into the desert, and the landslides of the mountains.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Arrest four suspects attempted murder
Three teenage men and a 20-year-old man were arrested for attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with a stab wound in Somerset.
The young man was found injured in Excelsior Terrace Midsomer Norton, about 4:00 BST on Saturday.
He's taken to the hospital where he's in stable condition.
One 17 - year - old, two 18 - year - olds and a 20 - year - old man were arrested last night in Radstock, Avon, and Somerset, says the police.
The officer has already summoned anyone who might have video footage of the incident on his phone to report.
Trump says that Kavanaugh ‘receives hatred and anger’ from the Democratic Party
"One voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to reject the cruel and shameful democratic party," said Trump on a campaign in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump says that Kavanaugh "receives hatred and anger" from the Democratic Party during the process of advocacy
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, forced and emotionally denied a charge by Christine Blasey Ford that she had committed sexual violence to him a few decades ago while they were still a teenager.
Ford also testified at the trial about his statement.
The president said on Saturday that "Americans saw the intelligence and quality and courage of Kavanaugh that day.
"One voice of support for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to reinforce someone who has the most perfect legal thought in our time, a jury with a record of true public servants," he said to the West Virginia group of supporters.
The President implicitly refers to Kavanaugh's appointment as he talks about the importance of the participation of the Republicans in the middle of the election.
"Five weeks before one of the most important elections took place in our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm really running," he said.
"That's why I went there to come, fighting for a great candidate.
Trump argued that Democrat was on a mission to "compress and block."
The first voter procedure at the Senate level in Kavanaugh's appointment is expected to take place at the latest on Friday, an assistant senior GOP leader told CNN.
Hundreds of people died from an Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, with an increasing number of victims
Some 384 people were killed, many of whom died when the giant waves hit the shore, when earthquakes and tsunamis hit the island of Sulawesi Indonesia, said the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday when the six - foot (18 foot) wave destroyed the beach in the evening, causing a lot of death and destroying whatever it passed.
Tsunami was followed by an earthquake with a force of 7.5.
"When the tsunami threat increased yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and didn't run so fast that they became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesperson for the Disaster Relief Agency (BNPB) at the moment of tacitity in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, he dragged the cars, the wood, the house, pulled everything off the ground," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had passed through the open sea at 800 kph (497 mph) before setting up the coastline.
Some people climbed trees to save themselves from the tsunami and survived, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers of service in the tree.
Aerial photos taken by the BNPB show many buildings and shops that were destroyed, a crooked and amber bridge, and a mosque surrounded by water.
An earthquake continues to shake the city all over the beach on Saturday.
The earthquake is felt in 2.4 million people.
The Research and Technology Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that energy emitted at the massive earthquake on Friday was about 200 times stronger than the atomic bomb power dropped in Hiroshima in World War II.
The geographic location of the city, which is at the tip of the narrow bay, can increase the size of the tsunami, can be said to be.
Nugroho describes the damage that has occurred as "extensive" and states that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels have been destroyed.
Some victims were found trapped under the ruins of a destroyed building, he said, adding that there were 540 victims injured and 29 lost.
Nugroho says that the victims and damage could be greater along the coast line 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, a region called Donggala, which is closer to the earthquake center.
"Communication is completely paralyzed with no information from Donggala, says Nugroho.
There are over 300,000 people living there," said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that their members and volunteers are heading for the region affected by the disaster.
"It's a tragedy, but it could get worse," he said.
The forum related on Saturday received many criticisms because it did not inform that there was a tsunami circling the tree, although the authorities said that the waves had been circling at the time of the warning.
An amateur tape shared in social media showed a man on the floor on a building sounding warning with panic about the approaching tsunami, towards the people on the streets below.
In minutes the water rolls across the beach, disassemblying buildings and cars.
Reuters can't immediately prove the original record.
Earthquakes and tsunamis are the biggest cause of the electric ignition that breaks the communication around the Palu so that it makes it difficult for the authorities to coordinate their rescue efforts.
The military has already begun sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, said the authorities, but refugees still need food and other basic needs.
The Air City has been reopened only to channel aid efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has been scheduled to visit the evacuation center in Palu on Sunday.
The victim of Tsunami Indonesia increased over 800.
That's so terrible.
When World Vision officials from Donggala made it to safety in the city of Palu, where they protected them in the tent of the finest cloth that was built in their offices, on their way they had passed through various horrid areas, said Father Dosebah.
"They tell me they've seen a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
It's so terrible.
Even when relief groups began to move slowly to start disaster relief activities, some of the groups complained that there were attacks on foreign volunteers who had skills, who were about to leave for the Palu.
According to Indonesian rules, funding, overseas supplies and energy can only begin to be channelled if the affected areas have been officially declared a national disaster region.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a provincial disaster," said Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"At the time the government says, OK, this is a national disaster," we can receive international help, but there is no such status."
On the second night of the earthquake and tsunami in Palu, friends and families of the missing victims still hope that those whom they love will be part of the miracle that will correct the course of the tragic natural disaster.
On Saturday, a boy was expelled from the goth.
On Sunday, the rescuer took out a woman who was trapped under the debris for two days with the mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, an Indonesian national parallavian team coach, has been a coach for two missing parallavian athletes, who were able to follow the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Those still trapped at the Roa-Roa Hotel, with Father Mandagi, are his disciples.
"As a senior in parachute, I have my personal emotional burdens," he said.
Mr. Gendon told me how after the news of the destroyed Roa-Roa Hotel went around the parallady community, desperately he sent a message WhatsApp to the Palu competitors, who participated in the celebrations on the beach.
Even so, all the messages, only got one sign of the gray check, instead of two blues.
"I think it means no message sent," he said.
The robber took $26,750 during the ATM loading at Newport in Levee

The driver has emptied an ATM machine in the entertainment complex and prepared to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While he was working, another man ran from behind Brink's workers and stole one bag of money that was to be sent.

Anyone who has information about their identity can contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
That rapper changed his name to Ye.
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Announced the change of name via Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "First formally known as Kanye West."
West, aged 41, had already had Ye's name for some time and used it as his eighth album title, released in June.
The change was made before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, when he was expected to release his new album, Yandhi.
He replaced the singer Ariana Grande to perform at the show, which was cancelled because of "emotional reason," said the creator of the show.
As a abbreviation for his current professional name, West had previously said that to him the word had religious significance.
"I believe 'ye' is a common word used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'You," said West earlier this year, discussing the title of the album with radio publishers Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, that name is us.
The name is taken from Kanye, which means only the only one, to be Ye-- as a mirror of our goodness, our evil, our confusion, all of them.
It is more of our true self."
He was one of a number of rappers who changed their names.
Sean Combs in various ways has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announces his preference for the name Love and Brother Love.
Former West collaborator, JAY-Z also made it with or without a sign of the linkage and the big letters.
President of Mexico, AMLO, swear not to use the military in the face of civil society
President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has sworn that he will never use military power against the civilian community before the 50th anniversary of the bloody action against students.
Lopez Obrador pledges the day on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to "never use military force to pressure the Mexicans."
The army launched a shot at the peaceful demonstration activity held in the square on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people at that time, when left wing students moved their roots across the Latin American region.
Lopez Obrador has already guaranteed support for young Mexicans by providing monthly subsidies for those who are studying and opening up more free universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities encourage young people to form criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double the A.I. funding.
Because China is more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount of funding that will be used for research in that field, investor words and practice A2 Kai-Fu Lee, who has been working for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comment came after various parts of the U.S. government made announcements about AI, even when the U.S. overall lack of formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China outlined the plan last year: to be number one in the AI innovation of 2030.
"Reducing AI research funds is a good start, considering all other countries tend to stay away from the U.S., and we're looking for the next breakthrough in AI," said Lee.
Multiplying funds can double opportunities so that the next major AI achievement will be made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lea, owner of the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order" has been published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Innovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the leading AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he designed the AI system that defeated the best American Othello player, and then he became an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee admitted to the competition of U.S. government technology earlier like the Robotics Challenge for the Modern Defense Research Project and asked when the next activity would be carried out, to help identify the next visionary.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win the government's prize, said Lee.
"It's not China who's taking the lead in academics; it's a company," said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been employing academic figures for AI research for the past few years.
Lee says that changing immigration policies can also help the U.S. to support AI-related efforts.
"I think the green card can be offered automatically for the PHD holder in the AI field," he said.
The Chinese National Council issued the next Generation Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The Chinese Natural Science Foundation provides funding for people in academic institutions like the way the Natural Science Foundation and other government organizations share money with U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, says Lee.
Early this year in the U.S. Department of Defense developed the Joint Building Intelligence Center, which aims to involve industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the formation of the Committee for Building Intelligence.
And in this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called the Next AI.
As for NSF, recently DARPA invested more than $100 million a year for AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that called for the establishment of the National Security Commission for Building Intelligence has not seen any further action for months.
Macedonians make a vote in order to change the country's name
The Macedonians made a vote on Sunday to decide to change the country's name to "the North Macedonian Republic," an action that would settle disputes for a decade with Greece that had already denied its membership to be part of the European Union and NATO.
Greek, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains the view that the name of the neighbouring country on the north represents the recognition of ownership of its territory and has prohibited it from joining the country with NATO and the European Union.
Both governments reached an agreement in June on the basis of a new name, but nationalist opposition argued that change would damage the identity of most of the ethnic population of Slavia Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he wouldn't give his voice to the general election and a boycott campaign had raised doubts whether the election results could reach a minimum of 50 percent of the vote required for the election results to be declared legitimate.
The question on the soundtrack reads: "Do you agree to NATO and EU membership by accepting an agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argued that it was a price worth paying to get permission to enter the body like the European Union and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries born of Yugoslavia's destruction.
"I came today to give my voice for the future of the country, for the younger generation of Macedonia so that they could live free under the umbrella of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough members of parliament say they will obey the results of the vote to make decisions.
Change of name requires a two-by-three vote in parliament.
The National Election Commission says there's no reports of violations until 1 o'clock.
However, the results of the vote reached only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in the last election of Parliament in 2016 when 66 percent of voters were registered.
"I came to give my voice for my children, where we are in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62 years old, an elector at the capital of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko gave their voice for the election in Macedonia in order to change the country's name that would open the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavarkov, 54 years old, has prepared a small stage and pulls chairs in front of the tents made by those who will boycott the vote.
"We agreed to join NATO and the European Union, but we wanted to join with honor, not through the servant's door," said Cavavarkov.
"We are poor countries, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can switch to China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO will bring more investment needed for Macedonia, which has a level of unemployment over 20 percent.
"I believe most people will approve it because more than 80 percent of our society supports the European Union and NATO," said Zaev after giving his voice.
He said the results "yes" would be "confirming our future."
An opinion poll published by the Macedonian Policy Research Institution on Monday stated that between 30 and 43 percent of the voters would participate in the vote - less than the required number.
Another opinion, held by the Telma Macedonian TV station, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to come and give their voice on Sundays.
Of them, 70 percent said to vote yes.
In order for the vote to succeed, it takes 50 percent plus 1 vote.
A failure in the vote will represent a rejection of the first policy against the pro-barat government since taking over in May last year.
Witness: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City explores all Brighton’s defenses to score goals.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling were directed as Brighton's defense on Manchester City 2-0 victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium, Manchester, England.
Aguero made that win look very easy on his score in the minutes to 65.
Argentina's attacker received an operand in the middle of the field at the beginning of the match.
He ran among three people defending Brighton, before he stepped into the open field.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four green-tailed men.
He turned over one person to defend before running ahead of some other opponents at the end of Brighton's gallows.
Then he ran to his left, to Sterling.
The British fronts used their first kick from the gawang to operate the ball back to Aguero, which used its right foot to beat Brighton's kiper, Mathew Ryan with a kick to the right side of the gawang.
"Aguero struggles with some problems on his feet," said Pep Guardiola City's manager to the reporter.
"We're talking about him playing for 55, 60 minutes.
Sure enough, the young Bethelites have befriended Jacob.
We're glad he scored a goal at the time."
But Sterling gave Sky Blues first advantage in the First League fight.
That goal happened in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball, far within Brighton's territory at the game.
He's operating the ball with a deep kick through the left wing of Leroy Sane.
Sane did a little kicking the ball before taking Sterling to the farthest post.

Scherzer wants to turn spoiler versus Rockies
With the elimination of Nationals from the playoffs, there is no reason to force another game.
But Scherzer's too competitive hopes to be able to recruit Colorado Rockies at the match on Sunday, but only if there's still playoff involvement for Rockies, who excels in one match over the Los Angeles Dodgers at NL West.
Rockies at least haven't got a place after winning in the wild-card match against Nationals with a score of 5-2 on Friday night, but still trying to win their first division title.
"Although we play without winning, at least we can't figure out the atmosphere in Denver with a crowd of spectators and other teams that will compete at the highest level of any point I might have faced this year.
How could I not want to compete in such a match?"
Nationals haven't announced the opening game for Sunday, but reported that in such circumstances, they tend to let Scherzer join the match.
Scherzer, who will start a workshop for 34 times, holds a training session on Thursday and starts a Sunday game that is usually used to rest.

Trump campaigned in West Virginia.
The President referred to a situation that involved the future High Court's choice, Brett Kavanaugh, when discussing the importance of the results of the Republicans' vote in the middle of the election.
"All our efforts are at stake in November.
Five weeks before it was carried out the most important election in our lives.
This is one of the big, big -- I don't really run that's why I fight everywhere for an amazing candidate," he said.
Trump goes on, "You see there's a very awful radical Democrat group, you can see it happening right now.
And they decided to take back power in any way, you see the crimes, their abuses.
They don't care who they hurt, who they should be beautiful in order to gain power and control. That's what they want.
Democrat, he said, was on a mission to "reject and block."
"And you've seen it for the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "murk and evil and vile and unbelievable and unbelievable."
He referred to the Senate of Dianne Feinstein, who served on the Senate Court Committee by pronouncing his name, which was widely received by his listeners.
"Look what's the answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh no, I'm waiting for it -- it's a very bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Working Power Party is no longer a public service place.
Now be intolerant to anyone who puts his mind on it.
When Momentum activist at the local party gave me a voice to criticize myself, it wasn't surprising.
After all, I was in the last order of Members of Parliament, who were told that our presence was not expected - all because we expressed our views.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan got similar treatment because he defended antisemitism firmly.
In my case, the violence criticized me for not having an agreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policy, in national security, in Europe, the issue that is ironically the same as that faced by Jeremy Corbyn with previous leaders.
Notice for the meeting of the East Nottingham workers on Friday states that "we want the meeting to be exclusive and productive."
For nearly eight years I became a member of the local Labour Parliament, a meeting of the General Committee on Friday evening was exactly like that.
Unfortunately today, the nature of many meetings and promises about politics that are "better, more friendly" has not long been forgotten, if, indeed, it has begun.
Opinions in the workers ’ party are becoming more and more unacceptable and every opinion is judged by party authority.
It began soon after Jeremy became the leader, as a colleague I thought would share the same political view, began to expect me to turn around and take a position that I would never have received - both in national security and the single European Union market.
Whenever I speak openly - and no matter what I say - then there will be a trial in social media that asks for a cancellation of the show, blaming central politics, telling me I should not be serving in the Labour party.
And it wasn't just me who experienced it.
Of course, I know that I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues because of the comments addressed to me that I tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and limitations of my colleagues who face sexual harassment or racism every day but never avoid it.
One of the most disappointing aspects of the current political era is how much abuse has been considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour party should help develop a culture of tolerance.
The truth is that we're no longer in a broader church and with every "unbelief" motion or turn the selection of party rules into more limited.
I got a lot of advice over the past two years that motivated me to keep my head down, not make a lot of sense, and then I'll say, "All right."
But I didn't get into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Working Party 32 years ago when I was still a school student, provoked by the preaching of the Thatcher government that led to my school of understanding literally collapsed, I have been trying to fight for better public service for those who desperately need it - both as local counselors and ministers in the government.
I have never hidden my political actions, including my last election.
No one in Eastern Nottingham will question my policy position and things that I disagree about in leadership right now.
For those who encourage the motion on Friday, what I can say is when the country moves fast towards the division of sovereignty (Brexit), it's going to endanger the affairs of the country and our public service, I don't want to waste time and energy for loyalty to the leaders of the Labour Party.
But really, one of my messages is not for Nottingham Momentum, it's for my constitution, as a member of the Labour Party or not.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Invincible Ayr ascends to the top
The last two experiments may have been a little cheating on the end results, but no doubt Ayr deserves to win the Tennent's Premiership match that's been very entertaining today.
Now they're in the top order, the only unbeatable part of ten.
In the end, their superior defenses, and their ability to get the best chance, which made Peter Murchie’s team of hosts and trainers the right to feel happy.
"So far we've tested our game, and we're still not defeated so we're happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose says: "Appreciation for Ayr, they're better at taking chances than we do."
Grant Anderson's trial in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in front, but the yellow card for Captain Scotland Rory Hughes, given to the game by Warriors, gives Melrose an opportunity to print numbers and Jason Baggot hacked unconverted experiments.
Climo extended Ayr's leadership with a penalty, before, right in the middle of time, he scored goals and then did a single experiment to make Ayr score 17-5 at rest.
But Melrose began the second half well and Patrick Anderson’s trial that was changed by Baggot, reduced chances to five points.
Then there was a long pause because Ruaridh Knott had a serious wound, being held out, and since the beginning of the match, Ayr moved faster than Stafford McDowall's experiment effort, modified by Climo.
Captain Ayr Blair Macpherson then hit the yellow card and again, Melrose made a backup player pay with an unaltered Bruce Colvine experiment, at the end of hard pressure.
The host has returned to play, however, at the time Struan Hutchinson got the yellow card for circling the climo without the ball, from the penal line, MacPherson arrived behind the injured Ayr who moved forward.
Climate was replaced, as was the case again, almost from the beginning of the game, after Kyle Rowe made a wink kick and broke the fifth effort of the actor Gregor Henry.
Still Game Star looks ready to run his new career in the restaurant industry
The Still Game Kieran star appears to be ready to move to the service industry after being known that he was appointed as a director of a licensed restaurant.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis performer at the BBC's popular event, who was broadcasted and also stared with the old comedian, Greg Hemphil.
The couple had announced that the nine-series to come were the last episode, and Kiernan apparently planned to drive straight after Craiglang.
According to the official record list, he's Director Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, even though a Scottish Sun source suggested that Kiernan was trying to get involved in the "growing restaurant business in Glasgow.
‘The sea is ours: Bolivia surrounded by land hopes that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific.
Sailors made patrols at the main police station in La Paz.
Public buildings raise a blue sea flag.
The Navy's camp from Titicaca to Amazon is being set up with a motorcycle: "The sea is our legitimate right.
To rise again is a duty."
Through the land - encircled Bolivia, memories of the loss of a coastline to Chile in a 19th - century bloody conflict are still clear as a desire for once again to sail the Pacific Ocean.
That hope is likely to reach its peak in a few decades, for Bolivia is waiting for a ruling from the court on October 1, after a five - year convention.
"Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and peace, and of course a positive hope for the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the ICJ trial on wide screens across the country, hoping that the court in Den Haag will support Bolivia’s demands that - after a few decades - Chile is obliged to negotiate Bolivia’s guarantee of sovereignty over the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivian native president who faced a controversial war for next year's election - also had a lot of support on Monday's trial.
"We are very close to the return of the Pacific Sea," he swore at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court can't decide what Bolivia wants-- and it'll only change a little if it's possible.
The Netherlands based on the UN's body has no power to surrender Chile's territory, and it has already established that it will not decide the outcome of the likely dispute.
That the ICJ's decision came only six months after the final argument was heard, which indicated the case "incomplex," said Paz Zárate, an international law expert in Chile.
And still far from continuing Bolivia's demands, in the last four years, it may have been a loss.
"The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the Bolivian government now," he said.
The aggressive rhetoric of Morales has weakened the good character of the remaining Chileans, he said.
Bolivia and Chile at a certain point will remain afloat, but it will be very difficult to keep up discussions after this.
Since 1962, both countries have not exchanged ambassadors or embassies.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivian government deputy in Den Haag quickly rejected the idea of decision making.
Monday will give Bolivia "a great opportunity to open an era of relationship with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales-still one of the most famous Latin American presidents-used maritime issues as a political supporter.
Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Sea," he added.
"The trial is an opportunity to see what we need to finish the past."
North Korea says nuclear weapons leaks won't happen unless they can trust the U.S.
Minister of Foreign Affairs North Korea Ri Yong Ho said his first country would never disarm nuclear weapons if Korea couldn't trust Washington.
Ri made a statement on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He mentioned that the United States was making a deal that was made at a meeting in Singapore between rival leaders.
His comment came up when Secretary of State of the United States of America Mike Pompeo saw almost starting nuclear diplomacy that had been dead for more than three months after meeting with Kim Jong One from North Korea.
Ri says only one "your dream" that by continuing U.S. sanctions and rejection of the declaration of the Korean War settlement will make North Korea surrender.
Washington was watching to approve the declaration without Pyongyang making an effort to stop the armed forces first.
Both Kim and President of the U.S. Donald Trump want to hold a second meeting.
But there is a widespread doubt that Pyongyang is serious about the acknowledgement of the weapons warehouse that the country has been the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeii plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump
Paris fashion show shows show show a lot of recent collections closing heads up to the main road near you
If you want to multiply the hat collection or really want to be protected from sunlight don't look for anything else.
Designer Valentino and Thom Browne released a series of large head coverings for their SS19 collection on stage fashion shows with the dazzling style held in Paris Fashion Week.
The hat that really isn't practical has swept the Instagram this summer and these designers have watched creations that are eye-catching on stage.
The highlight of Valentino is the cream - colored hat that is above it is adorned with a wide fur lining that covers the model’s head.
Large accessories include a pair of jewels decorated with diamonds, witches' hats, and even a pineapple, but not made to warm the head.
Thom Browne also showed a bunch of weird-and-right masks near Halloween.
Many masks of different colors his lips have been stitched and look like Hannibal Lecter compared to high couture.
A similar creation of scuba diving equipment is equipped with snorkels and glasses, while the others look like melted ice cream.
And if you keep going through those news fashion collections-- then you're lucky.
Mode observers estimate that the large hat collection will be placed on the main road near you.
Big hats become a very smooth train in the ‘La Bomba’, straw hat with a two-legged edge is used by everyone including Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The veneration of labels behind hats that are very impractical increasing from social media makes a great creation on the coastline of the huge straw almost the same as swimwear - used with a slim model.
The sack of a burnt raft, cut with a stripe on the edge with a white strap, is an outstanding feature of the collection Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 in Paris Fashion Week.
The celebrity hairdresser Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I hope to see the big hat and beach bag arrive on the main road for next summer--because the designer has made a big impact, it will be hard to ignore the request for the big accessory'
John Edward: Language skills are very important to global citizens
Scotland’s private school kept track of academic excellence, and this was continued in 2018 with an extraordinary test, which was reinforced by every student and collective success in sports, art, music and hard work.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Private School Council (SCIS) strive hard to provide the best service for students and parents.
The independent school aims to prepare its students for further and higher education, their chosen careers, and their role as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement the school curriculum as expected, we see that modern language continues to be the eye of popular choice and desired in many schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to someone in the language he understands, your words will come into his head.
If you speak to him in his language then your words will go into his heart."
It's a powerful reminder that we can't only rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the latest test results this year, we can see that language is the top position of the league table with the highest graduation value in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students learning foreign language get A Plus.
The data, gathered from 74 SCIS schools showing that 72 percent of students gain A Plus in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who learn German, 69 percent of those who learn French and 63 percent who learn Spanish also gain A.
This indicates that independent school in Scotland supports foreign language as an important skill that will certainly be needed by children and adolescents in the future.
Today, as a choice of language, the language is held in the same standard as the STEM study (scientific, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the modern school curriculum and elsewhere.
A survey carried out by the British Service of Entrepreneurship and Skills in 2014 found that for some reason the workers had to continue to struggle to fill the halls, 17 percent why language skills were lacking.
Thus, language skills are increasingly encouraged to prepare young people for their careers in the near future.
As the opportunities for more work become available, that skill will be absolutely essential in a global world.
Regardless of one’s career choices, if they have learned a second language, in the future they will feel the real benefit of having such skills in life.
Being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically make a multilanguage superior in competition.
According to YouGov’s opinion of more than 4,000 English adults in 2013, 75 percent of them did not speak foreign languages well enough to do French and talk as the only language spoken in two digits, 15 percent.
This is why investing in language teaching for children today is important for the moment.
Having multi-language skills, especially in the languages of developing countries, will multiply children with a better opportunity to find meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, every school will teach different languages.
Some schools will focus on a more classical modern language, while others will teach the language that is considered the most important in England for the next few years, namely 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interest, there will always be a number of languages that can be selected in independent schools, with an expert teacher’s staff in this field.
Scotland's independent school is designed to provide a learning environment that will prepare the children and multiply them with the skills necessary to succeed, whatever happens in the future.
It cannot be ruled out that at present, in the global business environment, language will always be an important aspect of determining the future of the country, so this should be a major part of education.
In fact, modern language must really be regarded as "international communication skills."
Selfish school will continue to offer choice, diversity, and this excellence for Scottish teenagers.
We've got to do it right.

LeBron will be debuting for Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
Waiting for fans to see LeBron James set off his debut for Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Coach Laker Luke Walton has announced that James will be playing in opening pre-season Sunday against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it has not been determined how many minutes he will play.
"It'll be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the official Lakers website.
Reporter Lakers Mike Trudell wrote tweets that James might be playing just a few minutes.
After the initial exercise this week, James was asked about his plan for six Lakers pre-games.
"At the stage of my career right now, I don't need to do a pre-season match to prepare," he said.
General Trump Team schedule in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump started a general campaign meeting tonight at Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first general meeting of the five general meetings scheduled next week, including a stop in some fun places that include Tennessee and Mississippi.
After asserting that the vote was postponed so that he could choose the fill of the Supreme Court, Trump intended to build support for him for the upcoming part-time elections because the Republican Party would lose control of Congress if the vote was held in November.
What time was Trump's general meeting in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch online?
Trump General Meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia scheduled at 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's public meeting in West Virginia online via direct broadcast on YouTube.
Trump's possibility of discussing this week's trial for the upcoming Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, which is becoming more tense after the accusation of dishonest sexual activity and the estimates of Senate election votes will be postponed until a week while the FBI investigates it.
But the main purpose of this public meeting agenda is to help the Republican party to get a few moments in the face of the November general election.
Therefore, in President Trump's campaign it is mentioned that five general meetings next week are aimed at "encouraging volunteers and supporters because the Republican party is trying to protect and expand the majority they hold in the Senate and the DPR," says Reuters.
"Congress control is so important to his agenda that the president will be as likely to travel to the states as long as we face the busy campaign season," said Trump campaign spokesman who refused to mention his name to Reuters.
Scheduled for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, a general meeting tonight is expected to provide support from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and pull the media from Pittsburgh," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second Trump visit to West Virginia in the last month, the state he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump tried to help Patrick Morrisey, West Virginia Senate candidate for the Republican Party who remained in the poll.
"Not a good sign for Morrisey so the president should come as an effort to improve his winnings in the opinion," said Simon Haeder, a politician at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: United States team shows courage to maintain their hope in the face of a single game on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, the foursome session Saturday afternoon is probably needed in this Ryder Cup.
The momentum band swing is the concept of sport that is the result of the complete trust of the players, and nothing is more than this competition.
Where do they think the moment is right now?
"In the past, they're six points and now four points, so I think we consider it a little bit of a moment," Jordan Spieth said while passing that day.
Certainly Europe has a profit because it excels four points with twelve more games.
But the American team, like Spieth said, felt they had a little momentum and they had a lot of things that could be exciting, except for the Spieth and Justin Thomas formations that played together all day and each boasted three of four points.
Spieth has been playing deadlyly from the tee area to the green area and leading with caution.
The clamoring of the parachute is getting harder as the turn comes, making the Putting blow important to make a series match when he and Thomas lose two against two.
His puttling beat won them at number 15 that was greeted with a similar shout, a shout that told you that he was sure America didn't lose.
"You really should try harder and worry about your own game," said Spieth.
All these players are gone now.
18 holes need to be marked.
The only player with more points than Spieth and Thomas for two days yesterday was Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, an unbeatable story from Ryder Cup.
The unique but interesting couple from Europe are four for four and can do without mistake.
"Moliwood" is the only couple who didn't do a bugey punch on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
That run, and how their energies seem to flow both to and from this crowded crowd that convinces them that they are players to be defeated on Sundays, and no players are more famous than Fleetwood or Molinari who will seal the potential of European victory at sunset over Le Golf National.
It's better if at the same time both are placed in a different hole.
Still, it's too early to talk about Europe's victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson cut off Sergio Garcia's work, fourball hero in the morning, when he was installed with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles on the front nine like digging holes that will never be climbn by this Spanish and Swedish golfer.
Although, on Sunday no one can help you get out of the hole.
Fourball and foursome is a good show to see closer because of the interaction between the couple, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and how strategies can change immediately.
So far, Europe is playing better as a team and leading quite far towards the final day, but the foursome session also shows that the US team has the guts to compete despite some doubts, especially in the United States.
Europe's top 10-6 on the last day Ryder Cup
Europe will take advantage of the final day Ryder Cup after a rise in fourball and foursome games on Saturday by leading 10-6 over the United States.
The duo inspired Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two victories over Tiger Woods who had to fight to write down their points so far in Le Golf National with four points.
The European team Thomas Bjorn, who wanted to defend the trophies that didn't seem to have been obtained in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American team with the wrong target in the morning ovenball, turned this series into 3-1.
The United States gave more fighting in foursomes, won two matches, but they couldn't reduce deficits.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points of 12 single matches on Sunday to maintain the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first European debut to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who were called "Molliwood" after the sensational weekend, were only the second pair to win four points of their four openings in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in their fourballs they became very strong to defeat Woods who pummeled and debuted America Bryson Dechambeau with more force 5&4.
Woods, who forced himself through two matches on Saturday, once a brilliant performance, but he's already lost 19 of 29 matches in fourball and foursomes and sevens in a row.
Justin Rose, resting at fourball in the morning, then returning to mate with Henrik Stenson in foursome and lost 2&1 from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranks one and three worlds.
Europe didn't reach it itself even though the day was fun and winding in the southwest of Paris.
The main winner three times Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a two-point U.S. measure for America on Saturday.
They won 2&1 win that pulls over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter from Spain in fourball then back to defeat Poulter and Rory McIllroy 4&3 in foursome after losing two first holes.
It just happened twice in Ryder Cup history where a team returned from the four-point deficit into the single game, although as a Furyk team champion just needed a serial point to maintain the trophy.
After becoming the second best for two days, however, a return attack on Sunday seems to exceed them.
North Korea says 'can't' will disarm weapons side by side without any trust
On Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea announced to the United Nations that the sanctions that continued to deepen their distrust of the United States and that country could not have disarmed its nuclear weapons separately in such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho told the General Council of the world's annual body that North Korea has taken "significant steps that show good intentions" last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile testing, releasing the nuclear test site, and promising not to develop nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"Namun, we didn't see any appropriate responses from the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security and in such a situation we can't just cut our own weapons apart."
While Ri repeated the same complaint from North Korea about Washington's resistance to the "progress" approach to de-enactment in which North Korea would be punished for taking step by step, it was significant that they did not completely reject what Pyongyang did in the past.
It refers to the joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the summit meeting between the President of the United States and the new North Korean leader this time held in Singapore on June 12, at that time Kim promised to pursue "the Korean border filling" while Trump promised North Korea security assurance.
North Korea has wanted the end of the Korean War 1950-53 officially, but the United States says Pyongyang should stop his nuclear weapons first.
Washington also refused the call to release international heavy sanctions in North Korea.
"The United States insists on "pre-enactment" and increases pressure by giving semi-sanctions to achieve their goal by force, and even rejects "the statement of the end of the war," Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can make us bend our knees is the illusion of people who don't know about us.
But the problem is that the constant punishment will deepen our distrust."
Ri did not mention the plan for the second summit meeting between Kim and Trump, which was hosted by the United States leaders at the United Nations earlier this week.
In the past five months, the minister has pointed out three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in and added: "If the problem party in this denuklirisation is South Korea and not the United States, the South Korean border deuklirisation will not reach such a dead end."
Nevertheless, Ri's tone of speech was dramatically different from last year, when he spoke to the U.N. General Congregation that targeted North Korean rockets on U.S. soil was an inevitable thing after "Mr. Devil President" Trump called Kim a "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
This year at the UN meeting, Trump last year threatened to "destruct" North Korea altogether, praised Kim for her courage to take the step to disarm, but the great work still had to be done and the sanctions had to be done until North Korea did a denuclision.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no time limit for this, "If it takes two years, three years or five months--no problem," he said.
Tiongkok and Russia believe that the UN Security Council must punish Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, the Foreign Minister of the United States, Mike Pompeo, spoke to the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "Resisting Security Council sanctions must be continued firmly and must not fail until we know that complete, final and verified de-enactment."
The Security Council with a round voice has increased sanctions for North Korea since 2006 as an attempt to stop the delivery of nuclear programs and Pyongyang ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met Ri at the General Council of the United Nations and said after that that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that there's actually been progress, just North Korea's clock count calls that he makes "a charge like a gangster."
North Korea promises at a meeting with Moon this month to unload the missile location and also nuclear complexes if the United States takes "the right action."
He stated that Kim told him to do "appropriate action" with his wish was the security assurance Trump promised in Singapore and moved towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students took a course on enough rest.
A new course at Harvard University this year made all S1 students sleep more, in an effort to fight macho culture in learning that is developing through 'man of the ghost bird' with caffeine.
An academy found that students at university number one in the world often don't know anything when discussing the very basic thing about how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep specialist medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed courses, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start a course after giving a lecture on the impact of sleeplessness on the study.
'At last a girl came to me and said, 'Why have I just been told now, in my final year?'
The girl said no one ever told me about the importance of sleeping -- which shocked me,' she told The Telegraph.
The course first launched this year, explained to the students how the essence of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic outcomes and improve their public well - being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health services, said that the university decided to introduce this course after finding students who were extremely sleepless all week.
This one - hour course involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one session there is a picture of the dorm room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sports pants, and books for explanations of the effects of caffeine and light, as well as how athletic results are influenced by sleep shortages, and the importance of sleep routines.
On the other hand, participants have found an explanation as to how long sleep shortages can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A campus map, with interactive icons, then prompts participants to think about their daily routine.
'We know this won't change student behavior instantly.
But we're convinced that they have the right to know-- like you have the right to know the effect of choosing to smoke cigarettes on health,' Professor Czeisler's womb.
Culture prided on the "breaths" still exists, it's learned, plus that modern technology and constant pressure on students that means lack of sleep is an ongoing problem.
Make sure you sleep enough, with good quality, have to be a 'secret weapon' to fight stress, fatigue, and anxiety, it takes -- even to avoid weight gain, because lack of sleep makes the brain trigger hunger, causing continued hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student of chemistry and physical biology who helped Professor Czeisler design the course, has taken one of his classes last year in Harvard.
He said that this course has opened his eyes and inspired him to organize courses for the entire college.
Next step, he hoped that the entire graduate student would be instructed to complete a similar study program before joining a competitive institution.
Prof. Czeisler recommended that students should consider setting up sleep alarms, also wake-up alarms, and realize the effect of the ‘blue light’ emitted by the electronics screen and LED lights, which can move your bypass rhythm out of its path to cause trouble sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Gol Menga mentally lowers Gerrard's army
Again, Rangers felt the sadness of the day of the crash when Dolly's attack drove Steven Gerrard's team to the 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The Ibrax team was trying to record their first victory on their way, since the 4-1 win in February in St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team just gave Gerard a second victory in 18 games as manager, leaving his team eight points behind from the leader of the Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts class.
Attack seven minutes before the first round is over and the no-thinking Rangers don't seem to balance.
While Rangers are now down to sixth position, Livingston goes up to third position, leaving only one different goal of Hibernian.
And maybe there'll be a further problem in the Rangers' fortress after the Spence Calum has to be taken care of by a head injury after an object is thrown from a distance.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that copied Ayr to Betfred Cup semifinals.
On the contrary, Holt went with Livi 11 who took one point from Hearts last week and he'd be happy with the costumes that beat their opponents at every opportunity.
Rangers may dominate the possession of the ball, but Livingston makes better use of the ball they have.
They should have recorded the score in just two minutes when the first short bait was thrown by Scott Pittman through the Allan McGregor gauntlet, but the bulwark pulled that big chance too wide.
The Jacobs' free kick was deep and met Captain Craig Halkett but his companion Alan Lithgow could only stab him in the back.
Rangers took control but there seemed to be more hope than belief in their third game.
Alfredo Morelos must have felt that he was supposed to get penalized when he and Steven Lawless crashed at a quarter-hour mark but Steven Thomson refused this Colombian citizen.
Rangers only managed to do two shots in the first round but previously Iberox goalkeeper Liam Kelly, hardly ever had any trouble with Lassana Coulibaly's head count and easy-to-minimize Ovie Ejaria's attack.
Though Livi's opening goal in the 34th minute may be contrary to the path of the match, no one can deny that they deserve it because of their own hard work.
Once again Rangers failed to deal with Jacobs' death-ball tactics.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher put the ball on Scott Robinson, who remained calm chose Menga for the simple end.
Gerrard acted during the break by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and that change almost directly influenced when the wing player put the ball on Morelos but Kelly played impressively quickly out of line to prevent.
But Livingston kept forcing the team to play exactly what they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett sweeping all the long balls.
The Holt team was supposed to widen their excellence at the final stage but McGregor stood up well to get Jacobs out before Lithgow leaned wide from the corner.
Rangers' replacement player, Glenn Middleton, claimed another penalty when he disagreed with Jacobs, but again Thomson turned his face away.
Almanac: Geiger Counter
And now from our Sunday Morning page: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today, and more will continue... the day when future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed the method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, which was a discovery that eventually made the device called the Geiger Count.
As a scientific tool since then, the Geiger Breaker has also been a popular pop culture, such as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," starred by seemingly unconvincing cowboy scientists: Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
What kind of thing is that?"
Rogers: "This is a Geiger Count, used to find a radioactive mineral location, like uranium.
When you use this earphone, you can actually hear the atomic effects released by radioactive activity in minerals."
Evans: "Let's say, it's gonna come up now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery kept his name alive.
New cancer vaccine teaches immune system to ‘know’ bad cells
The new cancer vaccine taught the immune system to 'know' evil cells and kill them.
Vaccines teach immune systems to identify bad cells as part of treatment
The method involves the process of extracting immune cells from patients, changing them in the laboratory.
They can then 'know' a common protein on many cancers and then inject again
An experimental vaccine shows promising results to patients with various types of cancer.
A woman was treated with the vaccine, which taught the immune system to recognize the bad cell, her ovarian cancer was lost for more than 18 months.
This method involves the process of extracting patients' immune cells, changing them in the lab so they can "generate" proteins that are generally present in many cancers called HER2, and then reinjecting those cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the United States National Cancer Agency in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "The outcome shows that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promoting growth of some kind of cancer," including breast cancer, ovary, lungs, and cholorectal, Professor Berzofsky explains.
The same approach as taking patients' immune cells and "teaching" them how targeting cancer cells has succeeded in treating one type of leukemia.
Kanye West started the Pro-Trump Diatribe, wore the MAGA Hat, after the SNL look.
It's not going well.
Kanye West was slammed at the studio during Saturday Night Live after a fucked-up performance where he praised United States President Donald Trump and said he'd be recommending himself in 2020.
After bringing the third song that night, called Ghost Town where he wore Make America Great hats, he challenged the Democratic party and repeated his support for Trump.
"I often talk to white people and they say, "How do you like Trump, he's racist?"
Yeah, if I'm worried about racism, I've been out of America for a long time," he said.
SNL started a show with a password stared at Matt Damon where the Hollywood star laughed at Brett Kavanaugh's witness in front of the Senate's judicial committee on Christine Blasey Ford's sexual violence claim.
Although not broadcast, the West's peacock records were uploaded to social media by Chris Rock's comedian.
It's not clear if Rock is trying to make fun of the West with that bait.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he was having trouble behind the stage because of the hat he wore.
"They bowed me behind the stage.
They said, 'Don't go out with that hat.'
They fell down on me!
And then they said I was drowning," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see the sink?" said that he would wear Superman's coat, because this means you can't dictate what I should do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try to love."
His comment produces at least twice as shy as the spectators and the SNL viewers seem ashamed, Variety reports, with one person telling him: "The entire studio is silent."
West was taken in the last few moments as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, former rapist girlfriend Mac Miller who just died a few days ago.
West confuses many people with the appearance of I Love it, dressed like Perrier's Bottle.
West received support from the head of the TPUSA conservative group, Candace Turner, who wrote tweet: "For one of the bravest souls: Thank you for your love for your life."
But the host of Karen Hunter's show wrote tweets that West just "became itself and it was really very good."
"But I chose not to pay for someone (by buying music or clothes or supporting his art) whom I believe along and breaking dangerous ideology for my community.
He's free.
So do we," he added.
Before the show, the rapist announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, said that he is now "an official creature known as Kanye West."
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddy's tracks, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
A fellow rapist, Snoop Dogg had the name Snoop Lion and of course had the legend of Prince's music, turned its name into a symbol and then an artist formerly known as Prince.

The Star Game of Thrones Kit Harington criticises toxic masculinity
Harington's kit is famous for its role as Jon Snow on the mid-century fantasy series full of violence from the HBO Game of Thrones.
But this actor, 31, insisting on the stereotype of male hero, says that role on the screen of such a kind makes young boys often feel that they must be strong to respect.
Talk to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit says that he's convinced 'there's something wrong' and question how to deal with bad masculinity issues in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who just married his opponent at the Game of Thrones Rose Leslie, also 31, claims he felt 'strong enough' to discuss the issue.
'I feel personally, strong enough, right now--where is our fault in this masculinity?' he said.
'What do we teach men when they grow up, related to the problems we see now?'
Kit believes that television may be responsible for the emergence of a bad masculinity with its very masculine characters.
He continued: 'Where is the character born and what is taught?
What is taught on TV, and on the street, that makes boys feel they have to have this particular side to be men?
I think it's really one of the big questions at this time - how do we change it?
'Cause obviously there's something wrong with the young people.'
In that interview he also admitted that he would not play in the prekuel or sequel Game of Thrones when this series would end next summer, saying that he was already 'completed with the field of war and horses'.
Since November Kit will re-enact the True West of Sam Shepard, the story of the film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he considered meeting with his wife Rose to be the best reason to get out of the Game of Thrones.
'I met my wife in this show, thus giving me the future family, and from here my life began' his word.
Rose played Ygritte, the character love flower Kit is Jon Snow, in this Emmy award winning fantasy series.
The couple were married in June 2018 in the Leslie family’s homeland in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: Tiongkok reports 14% new cases
Tiongkok has announced 14% of its population living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are reported in this country, health officer said.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most new cases are transmitted through sex, marking changes from before.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through some parts of Tiongkok as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who have HIV in this way has declined to almost zero, the Tiongkok health official said at a conference in Yunnan Province.
Yet, from year to year, their HIV and AIDS lives in Thailand have increased to 100,000 people.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in the community of LGBT Tiongkok.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in Tyeongkok in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is called getting worse.
Because of the conservative value of this country, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many diseases are caused by improper sexual protection in this relationship.
Since 2003, the Tiongkok government has promised universal access to HIV treatment as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters contends that the staff has leaked Senator GOP's data, spread 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theory'
On Saturday, Maxine Waters' representative protested that one of his staff had sent personal information to three U.S. Republican Senators on the Wikipedia page of parliament members.
The Los Angeles Democrat Party confirms that the claim was moved by experts and the "urtra-right wing" website.
"False lies, lies, and many other nasty lies," said Waters in a Twitter statement.
It is reported that the information released includes the address of the home and telephone number of the United States Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, all from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, sent by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during the Senate panel congregation on the charge of sexual misconduct against the future Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh.
This bocoran appeared shortly after three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState report that IP addresses that identify the source of the shipment are connected to the Waters office and reveal information of one of the staff members Waters, Hill reports.
"This accusation is not based on a complete error and is an absolute lie," continues Waters.
"Member of my staff--identity, personal information, and safety are threatened as a result of misleading and misdemeanor charges--not at all responsible for the leaking of this information.
This is a lie.
The Waters statement quickly draws online criticism, including the former Secretary of the White House Press named Ari Fleischer.
"This disaster means anger," wrote Fleischer.
"This indicates he doesn't fit to be a Congressman.
A person who is falsely accused of something he has not done may not be able to do so.
They can't go astray.
They cannot question the motives of the accuser.
They must be calm and peaceful."
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters ’ reaction to the Democrat criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who accused critics of being overly angry during the Thursday congregation.
Omar Navarro, a Republican party candidate who is trying to move Waters in the part-time election, also broadcast his thoughts on Twitter.
"That's right," he wrote it on Twitter.
In his statement, Water said his office has warned "the right authority and the law enforcement entity about this wrong charge.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators will be revealed," he continued, "and they will be legally responsible for all their actions that are damaging and dangerous to one and all my staff members."
Johnny's review English Strikes Again - poor Rowan Atkinson spy parody
Now looking for Brexit's significance in every new film with British biased views has become a tradition and it seems to be valid for the re-emergence of Johnny English's parody parofa - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will syndicate sarcasm about how clearly bad we are being a new export opportunity for this country?
In any case, the uncompetent, muscular - looking Johnny English has updated his license to mess up everything for the second time - his name gives more than anything that he is a broad comical creation designed for non - English - language cinema territory.
Certainly he was a crazy secret agent who, despite his strange suspicion, had a little Clouseau character, a small character Mr. Bean and a circle of wanderers who donated a little note to the theme Chariots of Fire at the 2012 Olympic opening ceremony.
Indeed, he was based on international tourists and mysterious men who had been played by Atkinson on the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ad, leaving chaos behind him.
There's one or two sweet moments on this recent JE trip.
I like it when Johnny English approaches the helicopter by wearing medieval diapers and rotor ball bearings quickly sticking to his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for a physical comedian is shown, but his humor feels less powerful and too strange, especially when branding "serious" movies like 007 and Mission Impossible has been confident to insert comedians as materials.
It feels like it's meant for children rather than adults, and for me, the strange Johnny English is not innovative and the focus of Atkinson's funny movies in Bean's personality.
The award that's been warm for years is that England is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has entered a super-secret British spy web network, unveiling the identity of all British agents on the ground, to disappoint an agent on duty -- unfortunately only a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last chance for the proud and hostile prime minister, who has completely destroyed his popularity politically: Emma Thompson plays a very good role with the quasi-Teresa-May character but not much that can be taken from his script.
His intelligent advisor provides information that because every active spy has been weakened, he must bring one out of retirement.
And that means the little Johnny Englishman himself, now hired as the principal in some fancy buildings, but giving a secret lesson on how to operate undercover: there are some good jokes here, when English offers spy academy like the School of Rock.
English was returned to Whitehall for emergency briefing and reunited with a long-suffering old friend, Bough, told by Ben Miller again.
Bough's married now, getting married to a submarine commander, the role of the top-class bitch where Vicki Pepperdine is a little lost.
So Batman and Robin made a mistake on His Majesty's Secret Agent back in action, met a beautiful mystery woman of Ophelia Bulletova who was promoted by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister was concerned about falling into the influence of the charismatic technology millionaire who claimed to be able to solve the problem of British computers: the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough started their silly adventures: disguised as servants, they burned up the fast French saji restaurant; they made chaos by smuggled themselves into Volta's fancy ship; and English triggered anarchy when he tried to use the virtual reality headset to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
All the stops are certainly pulled for the last sequence, but with such hospitality and wealth, there's a little TV channel for the kids that's all about it.
That's pretty moderate.
And like another Johnny English movie, I can't help thinking: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really suits his talent?
The workers are planning plans for the British to work four days a week but are paid five days.
Jeremy Corbyn of the United Workers ’ Union considered radical plans that wanted British citizens to work four days a week - but paid five days.
The union was reported to want the owners of the company to continue the results of the arrest through artificial intelligence revolution (AI) for the workers by giving them an additional day off.
He will allow employees to enjoy the same amount of pay at the end of the week three days.
Some sources say that the idea will be 'pac' with the party's economic agenda and plans to encourage the country to support workers.
The four - day shift has been approved by the British Trade Congress as a way for workers to feel the benefits of economic change.
One source, which is senior of the Workers' Union, told The Sunday Times: 'The debate on this policy is expected to be announced before the end of this year.
'This won't happen overnight, but four days' work in a week is an aspiration that fits the party's approach to rebalance the economy that supports workers and the party industry's strategy as a whole.'
The Labour Party was not the first to support that idea, since the Green Party had promised four working days a week at the 2017 public election campaign.
However, these aspirations are currently not supported by the entire Labour Party.
The spokesperson of the Labour Party said: 'Four working days a week are not party policy and are not being considered by the party.'
The Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to perfect his vision for the socialist revolution in the economics.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from "anonymous director" and "students" at the utility company.
This shadow chancellor plan also means that current stockholders in drinking water companies may not be able to get their entire stock back because the government of the Labour Party can do 'conquests' on the grounds of infringements felt.
He also made sure his plan to put the workers in the company council and create the Inclusive Property Fund that would give 10 percent of the company's equity in the private sector to employees, who would cover the annual dividend up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told "60 Minutes" if FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their view
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final election of his opinion in the Supreme Court for at least one week, and raised questions as to whether this office's findings could affect the senators of the Republican Party to withdraw their support.
In an interview on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Senator of the Republic Party John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find something that would make them change their mind.
Looks like Kennedy's more open than his partner in South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said I'd attend the trial, I said, I've already spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this incident, the charge came up, and said, 'You did it?'
He's a firm, determined, firm man."
However, Graham’s voice apparently will not change.
"My mind has decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and it needs a bigger charge to change it," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what's going on, but what I know is: Brett strongly objected to it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone he mentioned cannot verify it.
He's 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes."
What is meant by the Global Citizen Festival and has this event been doing something to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York will be holding the Global Citizen Festival, a annual music event that shows a very impressive, and also effective mission; ending poverty in the world.
Now, in the seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will witness tens of thousands of people coming to Great Lawn in Central Park not only to enjoy the action of Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the purpose of this event that is actually ending extreme poverty in 2030.
Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, was the continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hoped to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting poverty.
In order to get free tickets for the event (except if you want to pay VIP tickets), the concert visitor must complete a series of tasks or "actions" such as volunteering, emailing the world's leaders, calling, or other ways that mean helping to raise awareness of their goals to end poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been in achieving its goal for the past 12 years?
Is the idea of giving gifts as a free concert the right way to ask people to do something, or is it just another case called "clickivism" - people feel like they're making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" than its supporters, pushing to set another goal.
It is said that this action has helped to trigger world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion that will influence more than 2.25 billion people in 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, this group has collected 390 commitments and announcements from their actions, at least $10 billion of them have been channelled or made fundraisers.
This group estimates that the funds so far have directly impacted nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some major commitments, among others, are The Power of Nutrition, a British-based partnership made up of investors and performers committed to "help children grow to their maximum potential," promised to give Rwanda $35 million to help end the country's lack of nutrition after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizen.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments, and Global Citizen like you, we can make social injustice about this shortage of diets a foot record in history," Ambassador The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman told the crowd at the London live concert in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions to increase nutrition for mothers and children in England, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which would reach 5 million women and children through nutrition.
Answering one of the questions in General Question on their website that asked "what makes you think we can end this extreme poverty?"
Global citizen answers: "It will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
Yet, like the movement of civil rights and great anti-apartheids that have existed before us, we will succeed, because if we unite we will grow stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe is some of the stars featured on this year's New York show, which will be led by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. can use the Navy as a "blockade" to hinder Russian energy exports - Secretary of State
"If necessary" Washington could ask the Navy for aid to prevent Russian energy from reaching the market, including in the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of State Ryan Zinke expressed, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke contends that Russian involvement in Syria - especially, where it operates on a legitimate government invitation - is an excuse for exploring the new energy market.
"I'm sure the reason they're in the Middle East is they want to be energy marketers, just like they did in Eastern Europe, southern Europe," he reported.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to prevent it.
"The United States has that ability, with our Navy, to ensure the open sea lanes, and, if necessary, to block, to ensure that their energy cannot enter the market," he said.
Zinke spoke in front of the event participants held by the Energy Consumer Alliance, a non-profit group that called himself "the voice of energy customers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to a deal with Russia and Iran, seeing that in terms of effectiveness, they're the same.
"Economy choices in Iran and Russia are less than that, using and replacing fuel," he said, referring to Russia as one of the "experts in the field" with the economy that relies on fossil fuels.
This statement appears when Trump's government representative is on mission in order to increase their liquid gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, a much cheaper option for customers in Europe.
To that end, Trump's government officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, tried to persuade Germany to pull itself out of North Stream 2 oil factory project "indecent," which Trump said, turned Berlin into "the captivity" Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly emphasized that the North Stream 2 oil plant project worth $11 billion, which is designed to double the capacity of the oil factory plant that exists up to 110 billion cubic feet [110 billion cubic meters], is a pure economic project.
Kremlin contended that Washington's strong opposition to this project was merely driven by economic reasons and was an example of unfair competition.
"I'm sure we have the same view that energy cannot be used as a pressure device and that customers should be able to choose their own buyer," said Russian Minister for Energy Aleksandr Novak after meeting with US Minister for Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
This US attitude has attracted reaction from Germany, which has reaffirmed their commitment to this project.
The leading German industry organization, Federation of German Industries (BDI), has asked the US not to interfere in European Union energy policy and bilateral agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
"I will face big problems if the third country mixes our energy supplies," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after the latest meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "watch the situation" when recommending himself as President in 2020, says Senator Massachusetts
On Saturday, Senator Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said he'd "look at the situation" when he nominated himself as president after the part-time election.
When campaigning at the city hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed he would consider recommending himself.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our crooked government, including putting women in the top position," as he said to The Hill.
"After the 6th of November, I'll look into the situation when I call myself president."
Warren compared himself to President Donald Trump while campaigning at the city hall, saying that he "brought this area in the wrong direction.
"I'm very worried about what Donald Trump did to our democracy," he said.
Warren's slanderous in speaking his criticism of Trump and the future head of Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "Of course we need an FBI investigation before we make a vote."
However, an opinion published on Thursday showed that most of Warren’s own constitution did not want him to recommend himself by 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the voter's "probability" in Massachusetts says it's best that the senator doesn't recommend himself, according to Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe opinion.
32 percent of the supporters.
The opinion showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick for self-proclaiming, with 38 percent supporting the potential for self-proclaiming and 48 percent against him.
Other important names on the Democratic Party discussed in connection with the possibility of recommending by 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'd officially decide in January, Associated Press reports.
Sarah Palin quotes PTSD Track Palin at Donald Trump campaign
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after entering the army in September.
He was arrested and charged in an incident of domestic violence on Monday night.
"What my son is going to experience when he returns, I can connect with other families who also feel the consequences of PTSD and some injuries suffered by our soldiers," he said in front of the audience attending the campaign for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his catch as "an elephant in the room" and told of his son and other veterans, "they returned a little bit differently, they returned harder, they went back and wondered if there was any respect for what they had given, fellow soldiers and passengers and every other member of the military to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, plus with reports of domestic violence and possession of weapons in a drunken state, according to Dan Bennett, spokesperson of the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. supports challenges to new asylum policies
Eighteen states and District of Columbia support the legal challenge to new U.S. policies that refuse asylum for victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
The representative of 18 states and this district filed a friend-of-the-court briefing on Friday in Washington to support the asylum seekers challenge the policy, NBC News reports.
The full name of the defendant Grace v. In the lawsuit of the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
He said his partner "and his son was a cruel gang member," had insulted him, but the U.S. officials refused his asylum request on July 20.
He's under arrest in Texas.
The state prosecutor who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which produced a large number of U.S. asylum seekers, as a country facing huge problems with gangs and domestic violence.
New U.S. asylum policy goes back to the Council's 2014 decision to allow black immigrants to flee from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Attorney General District of Columbia, Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that this new policy "has ignored state, federal, and international laws that have existed for decades."
"Federal law requires that all claims of asylum must be determined on the basis of certain facts and circumstances related to the claim, and such prohibition violates the principle," friend-of-the short briefing said.
Further the prosecutor's opinion is that the policy that refuses to get immigrants into the U.S. economy, says that they are likely to be entrepreneurs and "get the necessary workforce."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions, in June, ordered immigration judges to stop giving asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
"It is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear caused by racial, religious, national, or members of a social group, or certain political opinion," Sessions said in this policy announcement on June 11.
It's not meant to ease all the problems -- even though all the problems are serious -- that people face every day around the world.
A very sad rescue effort in the tree because the victim doubled twice as he raced with time to find a survivor
For those who survived, the situation was getting worse.
"It feels so tense," says the 35-year-old Rusa Kusuma, a mother, reassuring her boy who was begging at the refugee center of the devastated Palu city.
"Every minute the ambulance comes with a body.
Clean water is very rare."
People look back into their destroyed homes, pick up the water-sinked stuff, try to save anything they can find.
Hundreds of people are injured and taken care of in the hospital, the damage caused by a 7.5-strong earthquake, is so fucked up.
Some of those injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffer from fractures of the spine and shoulders, lie outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients are treated outside the room for powerful shocks.
Her tears flow as she recounts her feelings as the earthquake shakes the five - floor hotel room where she sleeps with her wife and daughter.
"I couldn't save myself.
I think I'm stuck in a wall collapse, "Dis told the Associated Press, he added his family to the city to attend the wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, then shut up.
I did not know my daughter and her circumstances.
May they be saved."
U.S. Ambassador accuses Tionkok 'doing intimidation' with 'advertising advertising'
A week after the official newspaper Tiongkok had a four-page advertisement in an US newspaper that called the U.S. trade back profits, the U.S. ambassador for Tiongkok accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
President of the U.S. Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the Chinese Daily Supplement to the Des Moines Registers in the state of Iowa - after accusing Tiongkok of trying to interfere in the U.S. Congress election on November 6, an accusation ruled by Tiongkok.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to get involved in the U.S. election, which marked what the U.S. official told Reuters, was a new phase in the expansion of Washington's campaign to press Tiongkok.
Although it's a common thing for foreign governments to put commercials to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in an ever-increasing trade war, which makes them raise their import tariff levels to each other.
The Tiongkok Retribution Rate at the beginning of this trade war is designed to hit exporters in the state like Iowa who support the Trump Republic Party, says Tiongkok and U.S.A.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador for Tiongkok and the former governor who led Iowa, the main exporter of agricultural goods to Tiongkok, said Beijing has damaged workers, farmers, and businessmen in America.
Tyeongkok, Branstad wrote an opinion in Des Moines Register on Sunday, "now double that intimidation by running propaganda advertisements on our own free media."
"In spreading his propaganda, the government of Tyeongkok took advantage of the tradition of free speech and press freedom that was highly valued in America with paid ads in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In fact, in the street newspaper outlets here, in Beijing, you'll find a barrier to different voices and you won't see any real insight into the different opinions that people can possibly have about the troubled Tiongkok economy, considering the media is under the control of the Communist Party of Tiongkok," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most prominent media in Tyeongkok refused to publish" his article, although he did not mention which newspaper.
Analysts Warning, Republic Party Avoids Women's Elections Toward Timely Elections With Kavanaugh Disasters
Since prominent people in the Republican Party stand up and defend the future head of Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh in the face of some sexual violence charges, analysts have warned that they will see a return attack, especially from women, on the upcoming part-time elections.
Emotions of this problem are very high, and most members of the Republican Party have already shown that they want to move forward in the vote.
It cannot be prevented," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School, Syracuse University told The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) push in the final minutes to do an FBI investigation would be enough to ease the anger of the election.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday--they will not forget it tomorrow, nor will they forget it in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national speech counselor for the progressive group MoveOn said on Friday, according to Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, demonstrators shouted "November is coming!" as they took a demonstration in the Senate hall when the Republican Party controlled the Justice Committee to continue to advance in Kavanaugh's defenses out of the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Anthusiasm and democracy motivation will come out of the list," non-Stu Rothenberg political analyst, told the news site.
"People say it's high enough; and it's true.
But it can be higher, especially among women's voice murmurers in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29, who because they don't like the president, often don't give voice."
Even before Ford’s public testimony explaining in detail the sexual harassment of himself by the prospective Supreme Court leader, analysts advised that there would be a retaliatory attack to follow if the Republican Party kept pushing him forward with confirmation.
"It became a mess for GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the National Committee of the Republic Party earlier last week, to NBC News.
"It's not just about the election of committees or the election of final votes or whether Cavanaugh will be placed on the reserve bench, it's also about how the Republican Party handles this issue and how they treat it," Guy Cecil, director of the US Priorities, a group that helps to choose the Democratic Party, points to the news channel.
But the Americans would seem to be divided about who should be trusted after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a slightly more supportive choice to the last.
A new review by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents really believe or perhaps believe in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent say they really believe or maybe believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they felt Kavanaugh might or really lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said similar things about Ford.
After Flake's push, the FBI is currently investigating the charges brought by Ford and another bully, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reports.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Justice Committee that the drunk Kavanaugh had attacked him when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez said that the Supreme Court's candidate showed him his candidacy when they attended a party while they were in Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Client Plans to Start New Internet to Face Google and Facebook
The Berners-Lee team, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launched a startup that attempted to compete with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The latest project of this technology legend, Inrupt, is a company built from the open-source platform Berners-Lee, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and anyone who is allowed to have access to any information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, while joking Berners-Lee says that the meaning behind Inrupt is "world dominance."
"We have to start now," he said from the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
This application uses Solid technology that allows people to make "personal online data storage" or their own POD.
This storage can contain contact lists, task lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available in one browser and all at the same time.
The unique thing about this personal online data storage is that it's really up to the user to access what kind of information.
In the company known as "personal ability through data."
The idea to set up Inrupt, according to CEO John Bruce, is to ensure that the company provides resources, processes, and proper skills to help Solid be available to everyone.
Currently this company is made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, security platform purchased by IBM, some staff developers contracted to work on the project, and the volunteer code-making community.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create decentralization applications themselves using tools available on Inrupt websites.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team didn't talk to "Facebook and Google about whether or not they would introduce a total change where all their business models would actually be reversed last night.
"We didn't ask for their permission."
In a post on the Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee writes that "the Inrupt mission is to provide energy and commercial ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built above Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the past few months, Berners-Lee has become an influential voice in net-disputed neutrality.
Even when Inrupt is launched, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about the next web era," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Warns WW1 Victoria Cross
The only Church scholar in England who won Victoria Cross during the First World War as a warrior, was remembered on his birthplace 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel The Reverend, Bernard Vann won the award on September 29, 1918 for an attack on Bellenglise and Lehaukort.
Four days later, however, he was killed by snipers and never knew that he had won the highest British military honor.
A warning rock was annihilated by two of his grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said this was a "smart symbol" that would reveal exactly 100 years of his grandfather's performance won the award.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led the battalion across Canal de Saint-Quentin "drained a very thick fog under the firing of field weapons and machinery."
Then he rushed forward to the battle line and with the "greatest courage" leading the front line before rushing to use the field weapons alone and slowing down three detachments.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by German snipers on October 4, 1918 - just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's action was "something I knew I couldn't live but it was a very humble act."
She and her brother, Dr. James Vann, also put up a flower bouquet after a parade, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann says he's "very flattered to play in this parade" and adds "the courage of a true hero being shown by the support of many people."
MMA fans sat all night watching Bellator 206, but they even got Peppa Pig
Imagine this, you've been spending an entire night watching a full 206 Bellator just to refuse to watch the main event.
The bills of San Jose contain 13 battles, including six on the main card and are being presented directly all night in England in Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were getting ready to face each other, the British audience was shocked when his mouth turned into Peppa Pig.
Some feel unappreciated after they have stayed until early in the special day of the fight.
A fan on Twitter describes the substitution for children's cartoon movies as "an annoying joke."
"It's a government rule, that at 6:00 a.m. the content is not suitable for presentation, so it's replaced with the children's programs," said Dave Schwartz, senior president of marketing and Bellator's communication, when asked about the transmission.
""Peppa the pig," yes."
The president of the company Bellator Scott Coker said that they would fix their schedule by counting the audience in England in the near future.
"In my opinion, if we think about replay, I think we might be able to finish it," said Coker.
"But right now there at six in the morning on Sunday and we won't be able to fix it until Sunday our time, on Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, at the time of change, there's a lot of back-and-back text and everything is uneducated.
We're trying to fix it, we think it's just a technical mistake.
No, it's a government problem.
Trust me, next time it won't happen again.
We're going to reduce to just five battles from six fights -- as we usually do -- and we're going to try to avoid overexploitation for fans, and we're going to succeed.
This is an unprofitable state."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels 'lowly' about sexuality
Dr. Tom Daley said he grew up with a low self - esteem because of his sexuality - but it gave him the motivation to succeed.
This 24-year-old man said he didn't realize until he entered high school, that "not everyone like me."
Speaking for the first time on Radio 4 Desert Island Discs brought by Lauren Laverne, he said, he spoke about the right of gays to give "hope" to others.
He also said being a parent doesn't care so much about winning the Olympics.
The host of a regular event brought a long time ago, Kirsty Young, was taking a few months off because of his illness.
Turns out to be the ones who get lost on the first Laverne program, Daley says he feels "less than" everyone else who grows up with him because "not a socially acceptable thing to like men and women."
He said, "To this day, it is a feeling less than others, and a feeling different, that has become a real thing that gives me strength and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he wouldn't let everyone down when they found out about his sexuality.
The two Olympic bronze medalists have been the leader of the famous LGBT campaign and have used their appearance at Commonwealth Games this year in Australia to attract more countries not to discriminate against homosexuals.
He said that he spoke because he felt lucky to be able to live without consequences and wanted to give "hope" to others.
World champion three times said he fell in love with a guy -- a movie maker from the U.S. Dustin Lance Black, who met him in 2013 -- "surprising me."
Daley married Oscar's 20 years older than he was last year, and said that age gap was not a problem.
"When you're having so many problems at a very young age" - she followed her first Olympics at the age of 14 and her father died of cancer three years later - she said it was very hard to find someone with the same age who had the same tide.
The couple had become parents in June, with a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said "the whole perspective" has changed.
"If you ask me last year, everything around 'I have to win the gold medal," he said.
"You know, there's something bigger than winning the Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son had the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 years after his diagnosis of brain cancer.
Daley says his father can't accept that he's going to die, and one of the last things he asks is whether they've got tickets for the 2012 London Olympics-- because he wants to sit in the front row.
"I can't tell him 'You won't sit in the front row father'," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and still didn't really stop breathing until he died, I finally admitted that he was invincible," he said.
The next year Daley competes at the 2012 Olympics and wins the bronze.
"All I know is, this is what I dreamt of all my life--to dive in front of the crowd in the Olympics, no feeling better than that," he said.
It also inspired his first song - Proud by Heather Small - that had joined him in preparing for the Olympics and still made him shiver.
Desert Island Discs is BBC Radio 4 broadcast on Sunday at 11.15 BST.
Mickelson changed his role when he went to Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American golfer Phil Mickelson will record the record on Sunday as he plays the 47th Ryder Cup match, but he has to change his role to avoid an unpleasant achievement.
Mickelson, who played on two-year-olds to record the 12th time, was suggested by Captain Jim Furyk for four-ball and four-group games on Saturday.
Instead of being in the middle of action, as he usually does for the United States, the main winner these five times divides the time between being a cheerleader and playing his game on that scale, hoping to fix what has been hard for him.
Never become the straightest golfer despite being at the top of his career, this 48 - year - old man does not fit to take a very strict course in Le Golf National, which routinely gives a long and harsh sentence for every wrong shot.
And for his own field, it's not scary enough for Mickelson, in the ninth match on Sunday, to face the very accurate British champion Francesco Molinari, who has worked with the new arrival Tommy Fleetwood to win all of their four matches this week.
If this American golfer starts 12 single games with four points below, starts with a hot start, then the Mickelson game proves to be very important.
Furyk expressed faith in this man, not because he could say a lot more.
"He really understands his role today, slaps my back and embraces me, and says he'll be ready for the match tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He's so confident.
He was Hall of Famer and he gave so much to this team in the past, and this week.
Maybe I can't imagine him playing two games.
I imagined the others, but that's the way they play and that's the way we think we should go.
He wants to enjoy another atmosphere, just like most people."
Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for the most played Ryder Cup game on Sunday.
It could mark the end of his career at Ryder Cup that would never match the height of his individual record.
Mickelson faces 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven times series, although Furyk says his presence brings some things that can't be said to the team.
"He's funny, he's sharp, he's funny, he likes to make fun of people, and he's a cool guy in the team room," he said.
"I think younger players have fun with him, too, this week, which is quite fun to see.
He's given a lot more than just playing."
Captain European Thomas Bjorn knew the great excellence could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, captain of Europe, learns from the experience that someone who leads quite big into his last single game at Ryder Cup can easily be an unpleasant journey.
Dane made his first debut at the 1997 Valderrama match, with the captain of the Seven Ballesteros team holding the top five points above America, but just touched the finish line with their noses with the slightest margin, won 141⁄2-131/2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we're getting a great lead in Valderrama; we're getting a big lead in Brookline, where we lost, and Valderrama, where we won, but just now," said Bjorn, taking pictures, after watching Class of 2018, winning 5-3 well on Friday and yesterday by leading 10-6 in Le Golf National.
So, history will show me and everyone on that team that this isn't over.
Tomorrow you'll enter a really boring game.
Get out and do everything right.
It's not over until you get the points on the writing board.
We have a target, and the goal is to win this trophy, and that's the focus.
I've been saying a long time ago, I've focused on the 12 players on our side, but we're also very aware of what's on the other side - the world's greatest players."
It's nice to see the players playing in the tough golf course, Bjorn adds: "In this case I'll never make it myself.
Tomorrow is a different star.
Tomorrow, individual players will move forward, and this is a different thing to do.
It's very nice to be out there with a partner when everything goes well, but if you're out there playing individually, then your full ability as a golfer will be tested.
That's the message you have to tell all the players, get the best out of yourself for the match tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner and he has to go to get the best out of him."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk's opponent will ask the player to play better individually than they do as a pair, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself has been on both ends of the final day of the great game, has become part of the team that won in Brookline before ending with defeat when Europe did "The Miracles in Medina."
"I remember every word," he answered how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, brought the players together toward the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you want to start it quickly as you see on Brookline, as you see in Medina.
When the momentum runs one direction, it will put a lot of pressure on the middle game.
We also set up a list of players and put people in different ways we think, you know, we're trying to do a miracle tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the fight against Rory McIllroy at the top match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter, the other European players are in the top order.
"I went with this group of people in order like this because I think it could close all the way," said Bjorn about his single choice.
The new German warship was rescheduled
The new German Navy fleet was supposed to be on duty in 2014 to replace the old Cold War War warship, but the ship will not be there until at least next year because the system is wrong and its cost is rising, the local media reports.
The assignment "Rheinland-Pfalz," the main ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg fleet, has now been postponed until the first part of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper, which quotes military speakers.
This ship was supposed to have joined the Navy in 2014, but the post-shipment problem has disrupted the fate of this ambitious project.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will come to replace the old Bremen class ship.
This ship will be equipped with strong cannons, a series of anti-flight missiles, and anti-kap missiles, as well as some demon technology, such as radar erasers, infrareds, and acoustic keys.
Other important features include longer periods of treatment — it should be possible to use the latest watchman ship for two years away from the port of origin.
However, the continuous postponement means this sophisticated warship -- which is said to allow Germany to highlight its strength abroad -- will be obsolete at the time of its start, Die Zeit notes.
The F125 ship of bad luck had become a announcement last year, when the German Navy officially refused to appoint the vessel and returned it to the Blohm & Voss ship building in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned the ship to shipbuilder after shipment.
Only a few reasons known behind the return of the ship, but the German media cites a number of important "weakware and hardware" that makes the warship useless if used for the battle mission.
The software malfunction is very important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be operated by the crew of 120 sailors - only half of the workforce on the older Bremen class warship.
It was also discovered that the ship’s bobbots were too much that would reduce its performance and limit the Navy’s ability to add updates in the future.
"Rheinland-Pfalz" with this 7,000-ton bomb is believed to be twice as heavy as a ship with a similar class used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the damaged hardware, the cost of production of the entire project - including crew training - is also a problem.
It is said to rise surprisingly up to €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - up from the beginning €2.2 billion.
The problem that gripped this latest watchman ship becomes vital in view of the latest warning that the German Navy has been forced into force.
Early this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament Defense Committee acknowledges that the Navy is actually "depleted with the ability to spread."
The officer said as this problem grew, because the old ships were no longer used, but there were no replacement ships available.
He regrets that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg's ship guards could join the Navy.
National Trust listens to bat's secret life secretly
New research was done at a farm in Scotland’s Highlands that aimed to reveal how bats use natural beams in their food hunts.
Hopefully this will give new light on this unique flying mammal behavior and help drive conservation activities in the future.
The studies carried out by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the common bats and sopranos and long-earned chocolate bats and Daubenton in Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special records will be placed at the main location around the property to track bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also perform cell surveillance using a detector.
The voicekeeper who analyzes all the recordings will ensure the frequency of bat calls and which species do what activity.
Then maps and habitat reports will be created to create images with a detailed scale of nature's beams about their behavior.
Rob Dewar, natural conservation advisor to the NTS, hopes this result will reveal which habitat area is most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help to determine the benefits of the work of habitat management such as the creation of grasslands and the best way to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
The bat population in Scotland and throughout England has fallen sharply in the last few centuries.
This bat is threatened by the work of building and development that affects the nest and the loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting also pose risks, such as sticky paper to trap bats and chemical treatment of building materials, as well as attacks by pet cats.
Actually, bats aren't blind.
However, because of his habit of hunting at night, his ear is more useful than his eye when it comes to catching prey.
They use advanced gemshot techniques to find insects properly and obstacles on their flight tracks.
NTS, responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks, and 76,000 acres [76,000 ha] of land across the country, is very concerned about bats.
It has ten trained forces, routinely doing surveys, incubation checks, and sometimes rescue efforts.
The organization has also set up the first and only natural goose in Scotland at the Threave farm in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten bat species in Scotland.
Farm manager David Thompson said that farming is a suitable area for bats.
"Here in Threave, we have a good area for bats," he said.
"We have ancient buildings, many old trees, and all good habitats.
But there's still much we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us to understand more about what they need to grow."
He stressed the importance of bat checks before doing conservation on property, because without realizing the possibility of the destruction of a copycat could kill up to 400 female and still small bats, which might destroy the entire local population.
Bats protected and killed, harassed, disturbed — or destroyed — are illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scotland's official for the Conservation of Religious Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
He said: "We still have to learn a lot about our bats and for many of our species that we have not known how their fate is."
Ronaldo who refuses the rape claim is preparing a lawyer to sue for German magazines.
Cristiano Ronaldo calls the rape claim on him "false news," and says that people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
The lawyer will sue German news magazine Der Spiegel, who published the charge.
This attacker Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He was then supposed to have paid him by giving $375,000 to keep his mouth shut about this incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Talked in the Instagram live video to 142 million of his followers hours after the complaint was reported, Ronaldo, aged 33, criticized the report as "false news."
"No, no, no, no.
What they say today is false news," the winner of Ballon d'Or five times said it to the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by calling my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the player adds with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyer is preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the accusation, which they call "the unacceptable privacy suspicion report," according to Reuters.
Advocate Christian Schertz said he would ask for compensation as "in exchange for moral losses in a number of amounts consistent with the weight of the infringement, which may be one of the most serious infringements of personal rights in the past few years."
The incident reportedly occurred in June 2009 in a suite room at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a club, Ronaldo and Mayorga were reported back to the player's room, where he was suspected of having raped him, according to a report presented at Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayor says Ronaldo kneels after the incident he was charged with and tells him that "99 percent" he's a "good man" who disappoints only "one percent."
The document said that Ronaldo confirmed that they both had sex, but it was based on mutual desire.
Mayor also said he went to the police station and had seen his injuries in the hospital, but then agreed to solve the problem outside the court because he felt "fear will get revenge" and worried "will be humiliated in public."
This 34-year-old woman says now she's trying to cancel the peace settlement because she's constantly experiencing trauma over the alleged incident.
Ronaldo almost joined Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the attack, and this summer he moved to the giant Italian Juve club with a deal of €100 million.
Brexit: England 'will regret forever' for the loss of carmakers
England would "feel sorry forever" if it lost its status as world leader after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added to Toyota, England had told the BBC that if the British came out of the European Union without a deal, for a while it would stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese carmaker said the impact of the border postponement if there was no deal, would have cost Brexit a job.
The factory in Burnaston - which made the production of the Toyota Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, with 90% exported to the entire European Union.
"My opinion is that if the British were to leave the European Union at the end of March, we would see the production delay in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, director of the Toyota administration in Burnaston.
Other British car producers have expressed their concern about their exit from the European Union without a deal about how trade in border crossings will run, including Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said it would close the mini factory in Oxford a few months after Brexit.
The main problem with what those carmakers said was the risk of a supply chain if there was no deal with Brexit.
The Toyota production line is run based on the principle of "time-bound" production, with spare parts entering every 37 minutes good of English and European Union buyers for cars manufactured according to orders.
If the British were to leave the European Union without a deal on March 29, there might be a disturbance at the border, which industry believes could cause the slowdown and lack of spare parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep supplies more than a day at her factory in Derbyshire, the company's representative said, and thus production will be stopped.
Clark said the Chequers Theresa May plan for relations with the European Union in the future is "calibrated properly to avoid cross-border checks."
"We have to have a deal, we want to get the best deal that will also allow what I say not only enjoy success at this moment, but for us to reach this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"It's not just Toyota but other producers too, that we really have to be able to continue what's already been a very good supply chain."
Toyota can't say how long its production will be stopped, but clearly in the long run, warns that increased costs will reduce the capacity of the factory's market and will eventually be detrimental in terms of the cost of work.
Peter Tsouvalaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a manager of the United Staff at the factory, says his member has been increasingly concerned: "According to my experience, once this job has gone off, it will never return again.
The government spokesperson said: "We have put forward a proper and reasonable plan for our relationship with the European Union in the future."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed, White House
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with High Attorney Rod Rosenstein's representative could be "scheduled back in a week" because the upcoming Supreme Court Chief Justice Brett Kavanaugh still continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the public elections, the relationship between Trump and Russian servants, and the potential that impedes justice by the president.
Whether Trump would fire the deputy high prosecutor or not, which would endanger Mueller's freedom, has triggered gossip in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing using telegrams to record talks with Trump and the possibility of merging the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein contested the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, in the middle of a report that he would resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the United Nations office in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would "chosen to not" fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid confrontation with the Senate Justice Committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women who had accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both would testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI investigation for a week over Kavanaugh's claim, the next postponement of a full Senate vote.
The press secretary Trump, Sarah Sanders, performed on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "Staying for the meeting hasn't been set, maybe this week, I can see that taking her back to the other week is good as well as remembering the other things that happened in the high court.
But we just see and I always want to deliver the latest news to the press."
Some journalists will object to the statement: Sanders has not held a press meeting in the White House since September 10.
The host of Chris Wallace's shows asked why.
Sanders says it's not because they don't like TV reporters "who are trying to draw attention," though, he says, "I don't agree with the fact that they're trying to draw attention."
Then he proposed that direct contact between Trump and the press be enhanced.
"The president did more direct questions than the previous president," he said without mentioning the evidence: "We've seen those numbers."
The meeting will still take place, says Sanders, but "if the press has a chance to ask the president of the United States directly, it's much better than talking to me.
We try to do it more often and you've seen us do a lot in the past few weeks and it'll replace the press conference if you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump routinely asked questions when leaving the White House or participating in open session or press conference with visiting senior officials.
The solo press conference rarely happens.
This week in New York, the president might show why, doing free looks and sometimes strange things before the journalists gather.
Secretary of Health wrote to European Union workers in NHS Scotland about concerns about Brexit issues
The Health Secretary has written a letter to the European Union staff working in NHS Scotland to express their gratitude to the country and hope that they will still be working here after Brexit's problem.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter in less than six months until England pulled itself from the European Union.
The government of Scotland has pledged to meet the fixed status grant fee for EU citizens working in the transferred public service.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between England and the European Union on this self-reliance are still continuing, approaching the decision that was expected this fall.
But the British government has also prepared for the possibility of no deal.
I know this must be very disturbing to you all.
That's why I want to reiterate now how much I appreciate the contributions of every member of the staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from all over the European Union, and others, bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and enhance health services, and benefit our patients and society.
Scotland really is your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie Experiencing Emergency Surgery After Experiencing Head Injury
The post-Tennesee State Tigers Gelandang, Christion Abercrombie underwent an emergency surgery after a head injury on the 31-27 defeat of Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, Mike Organ from Tennessee reported.
Coach Head of the Tennessee State, Rod Reed told the injured reporter it happened shortly before the round ended.
"He came to the edge of the field and fell unconscious there," said Reed.
Coaches and medical forces gave oxygen to Abercrombie on the edge of the field before putting it in the shed and brought it to further evaluation.
An official from the Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was out of the operating room at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "no details of the type of injury suffered" and the Tennessee State was trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, this two-tier student of red ties, was in his first season with the Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He got a total of five scissors on Saturday before leaving the match, which made the total of his scissors this season into 18 scissors.
Foreign buyers will charge higher materiel costs if they buy property in England
Foreign buyers will be charged higher materiel costs when they buy properties in England, along with extra money that will be used to help homeless people according to Tory's new plan
This step will hold off the success of Corbyn's movement in attracting young voters
The cost of this material will be charged to those who do not pay taxes in England.
The financial department estimates to collect up to £120 million a year-- to help homeless people.
Foreign buyers will wear higher mattresses when they buy properties in England - along with extra money that will be used to help homeless people, Theresa May will announce today.
This will be seen as an effort to hold back Jeremy Corbyn’s success in pulling young voters with promises will provide more affordable housing and target high income.
Material costs will be charged to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in Britain, as well as extra money that motivates government efforts to fight bums.
Extra fees are an additional charge for today’s materiel costs, including a higher level that was introduced two years ago to the second house purchase and the house purchase to be rented - can reach three percent.
The Finance Department expects this move to rise to £120 million a year.
It's estimated that 13 percent of the newly built property in London was purchased by non-English people, which caused a rise in prices and made it increasingly difficult for the first buyer to set foot on a household ladder.
Many rich areas in this country - usually in the capital - have become "the ghost city" because of the many foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
This new policy came out just a week after Boris Johnson called for cutting off the mattress cost to help more young people have their first home.
He accused a large construction company of maintaining the price of property remained high by buying land but not using it, and urged Mrs. May to ignore the quota for the affordable houses to repair the "casual housing" in England.
Corbyn has announced a series of reforms in attractive housing, including rent monitoring and ending the "no sense of guilt" placement.
He also wanted to give the council greater power to build new houses.
Mrs. May said: "Last night I promised I would dedicate the prime minister's position to restoring the English dream--that life should be better for every generation.
And that means repairing our booming housing market.
England will always be open to those who want to stay, work, and build lives here.
However, it is not a good thing for individuals who are not living in England, as well as companies based abroad, to buy a home as simple as those in England who have already worked hard.
For many people the dream of having a home becomes a very distant thing, and an indecent treatment of the homeless remains real."
Jack Ross: 'My main ambition is to lead the Scottish team'
Boss Sunderland, Jack Ross says "his main ambition" is to be a Scottish manager at some stage.
This 42-year-old Scottish player enjoys the challenge of reviving the North-East Club, which is currently ranked third in League One, at about three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last summer.
"I want to champion my country as a player.
I got B's hat and it's him," Ross told Sportsound, BBC Scotland.
"But I was big and often watched the Scottish team in Hampden with my father as a child, and it was always something that attracted me to return.
But the opportunity will come, if I succeed in managing the team."
Sunderland manager before Ross, including Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
This former Alloa Athletic boss said he didn't feel afraid to follow traces of great names in such a large club, after previously refusing the offer of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, the success of this moment will be measured by 'Can I return this club to the Premier League?'
Because of the structure and facilities in this club, no doubt to be in the Premier League," he said.
"Not an easy task to be there, but I might only see myself as a successful person here, if I could bring this club back there."
Ross' career in team management was only three years, after some time as a boss's assistant in Dubarton, and spent 15 months as a coach's staff in Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from degradation to third position, and turned St Mirren from the degradation abyss into the winner of the championship in the next season.
And Ross now says he feels more comfortable than he ever did during his career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren, and Hamilton Academic.
"This may be the intersection that I must cross," he remembers taking over Alloa.
"I really believe management is the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds strange because I'm fine, looking for a living in a normal way, and enjoying some natural things.
But playing can be hard.
A lot of things you have to go through every week.
I still experience it in terms of work pressure, but in management it feels fine.
I've always wanted to lead something and now I'm doing it, the most comfortable feeling I've ever felt in my adult life."
You can hear the full interview at Sportsound on Sunday, September 30, at Scottish Radio between 12:00 and 13.00 BST
The survey found, the right time for beer is at 5.30 p.m. on Saturday.
Summer summer waves have increased pub-pub income in England that is struggling to survive, but more pressure on the restaurant network.
Figures show that the pubs and bars saw a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July - but income in restaurants dropped by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, CGA's business consultant, who compiled those figures, said: "The bright sun is about to shine and British participation in the World Cup that's longer than expected means that July will follow the same pattern as June before, where public income increases by 2.8 percent, except a restaurant that gets a strong mood.
The drop in the restaurant trade of 1.8 percent in June is going to get worse in July.
The sale of pubs and bars that sell drinks so far is more powerful than what happens at the restaurant that goes down.
The pub that sells food also suffers from the heat of the sun, although it does not separate the restaurant operator.
Looks like people just came out for a drink.
Sales throughout the pubs and bars that sell drinks up to 6.6 percent for this month, with those that sell food down three percent."
Paul Newman, a leisure analyst and an RSM hotel, says: "This has continued the train we've seen since April.
The weather and the impact of social events or major sports remain the greatest factor involving market sales outside the home.
It is no wonder that the restaurant group continues to struggle to survive, although sales decline of 4.8 percent from year to year will be very painful over the ongoing cost pressure.
A long summer should not come when the operator who sells food has a bad time, and time will tell if the temperature is good enough that we have enjoyed in August will give us some needed rest."
Total sales growth throughout the pubs and restaurants, including the newly opened ones, is 2.7 percent in July, showing delays in brand launch.

One of five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents
Survey revealed, one of five children - some are still 11 - have a secret social media account they hide from their parents and teachers
The survey of 20,000 middle school students revealed the development of the page "False Institute"
This news has increased concern about posting sexual content
Twenty percent of students say they have "main" accounts to show parents
One of five children — some of whom are 11 years old — have kept their social media accounts secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 middle school students revealed the development of a "false institute" account -- a reference for a photo-sharing site on Instagram.
The news has increased the concern of posting sexual content.
Twenty percent of students say they're operating "main" accounts that have been cleaned up to be shown to parents, while they also have a private account.
A mother who found her 13-year-old daughter's secret site, found a teenager who asked others to "rape me."
The study conducted by British Digital Consciousness and the Head of the Women's School Conference" (HMC) of independent schools found 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, half of them claiming to keep personal accounts.
Chief HMC, Mike Buchanan says: "This disturbs so many teenagers who try to create online space that their parents and teachers cannot find."
Eilidh Doyle will be "sounding for athletes" at the Scottish Atlantic Council
Eilidh Doyle has been selected to enter the Scottish Atlantic Council as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the board of directors.
Doyle was the most honored Scottish athlete and field, and President Ian Beattie described this move as a great opportunity for those leading the sports field to benefit from his various experiences at the international level over the past few decades.
"Eilidh is highly respected throughout Scotland, England, and the world's athletic community and we believe that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by bringing him into the council," said Beattie.
Doyle says: "I acted as a voice for athletes and I wish I could really contribute and help lead sports in Scotland."
American athletic athletes, who won the 200-meter and 400-meter race at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta among the total of four Olympic gold medals and now became the BBC expert, are now unable to walk after a moment of ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "It was a month ago that I suffered a stroke.
I can't walk.
The doctor said that only time can determine if I can recover and to what extent the recovery is possible.
It's like a very tiring job to get back to full recovery, learn how to walk again, and today do the exercise of impatience!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Breast pump commercials comparing mother to cow have dissected opinions in the online world
The breast pump company has split opinions in the online world with an advertising that compares the nursing mother to the nursing cow.
To mark the launch of a product that is said to be "the breast pump that can be used with the world's first silent," Elvie's consumer technology company released an advertising inspired by funny music videos to demonstrate this new pump's freedom to express a mother.
Four moms danced on the barn with herds following songs that included lyrics like this: "Yes, I turn myself, but you don't see tails" and "If you don't notice it this isn't ambling, it's my boobs."
It goes on with the refrain: "Out pump, out pump, out pump, I feed them baby, out pump, out pump, I milk my woman."
However, advertising published on the company’s Facebook page has led to online controversy.
With 77,000 times seen and hundreds of comments, this video has received a varied reaction from viewers, with many saying this makes the industry a "fright" of milk.
"A very bad decision used cow to advertise this product.
Like us, cows should also become pregnant and give birth to milk, except the baby was stolen from them within a few days after giving birth," wrote someone.

Another comment: "A trauma that can be understood well for mothers and babies.
But why not use it to advertise the breast pump for the mother who has to look after the baby?"
The other adds: "An ad that is meaningless."
Someone else defended the ad, with a woman confessing that she found the song "funny."
"I think it's a genius idea.
I'll buy it if I'm still feeding.
Squealing makes me feel exactly like a cow.
It was a bit crazy, but I accepted it.
It's a genius product," wrote someone.
Another commented: "This is a fun advertisement for mothers who are blackmailing (often at their workplace or toilet) and who feel like "cattle."
This is neither a praiser nor a trial of the milk industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women revealed that they all felt dancing with hidden pumps tucked in their arms.
The basic concept of this campaign stems from the perception of many women who extolled the ASI who said they felt like cows.
However, Elvie Pump really shut down, without wire or tube and fit in the nursing bra, which gives women freedom to move, hold their baby, and even go out and squeeze.
Ana Balarin, a partner and ECD at Mother, comments: "Elvie pump is a worthy carrier product launched with conviction and provocation.
By comparing the image between expressing women and the silver cow we want to pump the ASI and all its challenges, and showing it in a way that consoles and delights with the full freedom offered by the new pump.
This isn't the first time that Elvie's pump became the main news.

Hundreds of migrant children moving quietly to tent camp at the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children is increasing even though the monthly border crossing is still unchanged, partly because of the harsh statements and policies introduced by the Trump government that make it difficult for children to be cared for with sponsors.
Basically, most sponsors themselves are immigrants without documents, and fear to jeopardize their own ability to stay in the country by moving forward to save children.
The risk increased in June, when the federal government announced that the prospective sponsors and other adult members of the household had to hand over fingerprints, and the data would be shared with the immigration government.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and Bea Cukai official, testified in front of Congress that the institution had captured dozens of people who had applied for the support of underage children.
The institution then made sure that 70 percent of those arrested did not have a criminal record.
"About 80 percent of those who become sponsors or members of the sponsor group are illegal in this country, and most of them are bad foreigners.
That's why we keep hunting those people," said Mr. Albence.
Aiming to process children faster, officials introduced new regulations requiring some of them to attend court within a month of being arrested, not after 60 days, which had become standards before, to speak to the shelter workers.
Most of them perform through video conference calls, not directly, to plead their legal status to the immigration judge.
Those who are deemed unworthy of help will be directly deported.
The longer the children are detained, the more likely they are becoming anxious or depressed, leading to increased violence or efforts to escape, telling workers where shelter and system reports have been received in recent months.
The lawyers say that the concern increases in larger facilities like Tornillo, whose signs exist in a child struggling tend to be ignored, because its size.
They say that moving children to the camp town without giving them enough emotional preparation or saying good-bye to their friends can make a lot of trauma worse.
Syria asked the U.S., French and Turkish 'occupied forces' to retreat immediately
Addressed in the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked Syrian refugees to return, even though the country's war had now entered the eighth year.
Moualem, who also served as the prime minister's deputy, said foreign troops were illegally occupying Syria, for reasons of fighting terrorism, and "will be handled accordingly."
"They must retreat as soon as possible and without any conditions," he said to the court.
Moualem asserts that "war against terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, with more than millions fleeing their homes.
He affirms that Damascus will continue to "fight this holy battle until we cleanse all Syria's territory of terror groups and "the presence of illegal foreign soldiers."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, especially training and influencing Kurdish and Syrian Arab troops against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the war - torn areas of the country.
With regard to the refugee problem, Moualem confirmed that they should return immediately, and he blames "a few Western countries" for "exploiting extraordinary fears" that motivate the refugees to move further away.
"We've asked international society and humanitarian organizations to facilitate this return," he said.
"They're politicizing what's supposed to be a completely humane problem."
The European Union and the United States warned that there would be no reconstruction aid for Syria until the political agreement between Assad and the opposition was reached to end the war.
UN diplomats said the latest agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major Idlib rebel fortress has provided an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkish deal prevents the massive attacks of the Syrian forces supported by Russia in that province, where there are three million people who live.
But Moualem affirms that the agreement has a "clear time" and leads to hope that military action will target the Mujahids including the warriors of the Nusra Front associated with Al-Qaeda, who "will be swept away."
UN U.N. Staffan de Mistura hoped quickly to convene the first meeting of a new committee made up of government and opposition members to create a post-war election for Syria and to open the way to the public elections.
Moualem placed the requirements of the Syrian government on the committee, affirming that panel work should be restricted "to review the current chapter of the Law," and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win the Second Period
According to that logic, Trump will win the public election again in 2020 except because many liberal spectators hope that the prosecution and scandal will end his presidency early.
No one doubted, "The end of the most dramatic presidency ever!"
Until now, there are no signs of fatigue for the audience.
Since 2014, the CNN's main watch rating has increased more than twice to 1.05 million and MSNBC almost three times to 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average 2.4 million major watchers, an increase of 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC "The Rachel Maddow Show" has reached the top of the cable TV with 3.5 million viewers on the night of the headline news.
"It's a spirit that makes people interested in something that's not understood," said Neal Baer, the drama host of the ABC "Designed Survivor," about the cabinet secretary who became president after the attack that destroyed Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a senior comedian writer and author "Just the Funny Parts: And some hard truth sneaking into Hollywood Boys" Club," has another theory.
He remembered taking a taxi in Boston before the 2016 general election.
The driver said he'd give Trump his voice right.
Why?
"He said, "Because he made me laugh," Miss Scovell told me.
There's a value of entertainment in a mess.
Certainly, unlike any other event on TV, the story stream from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, if the immigrant family can unite again and restore the global economy.
Unlike that, luxury can only be felt by the most special audience.
In spite of this, not just being a citizen of the country who knows when at six o'clock you found yourself watching panel experts discuss the use of "back" source Bob Woodward for his book called "Fear," wearing Paul Manafort's camel bomber jacket worth $15,000 (“a thick suit of pride,” Unravel The Washington Post) and the involvement of the terrible Stormy Daniels description of Trump's anatomy.
This time, I'll never see Super Mario again.
"The matter of the policy he does makes him like a reality event that comforts you every night," said Brent Montgomery, executive head Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator "Pawn Stars," about the performer and the course of Trump's daily story (as opposed to NFL, commending Kim Jong-un).

"I remember when we had all the crazy shows that day and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told me.

A lot of money from outside flooded the most severe part-time election competition in the White House.
Usually Pennsylvania 17 received a flood of money, thanks to the restoration of the district of Congress that buried two pages in the same chair.
Pittsburg District that was recently resettled, filed with Conor Lamb of Rep. Democrat - who won seats in the other district through the special election last spring.
Lamb advances against other knowledge, the Republic of Keith Rothfus, which now represents the old Pennsylvania 12 district, which is in the grip of the new Pennsylvania 17 district.
These maps were rearranged after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January decided that the old districts were unconstitutionally on the part of the Republic.
Competition in the new district of Pennsylvania 17 has resulted in a large campaign between the major financial side of the party, Democratic Campaign Congressal Committee (DCCC) and National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became increasingly known in Pennsylvania after a thin victory in the special election of March, which was announced to the District Congress of 18 Pennsylvania.
The seat has been occupied by the Republican Party's official for over a decade, and President Donald Trump wins the district with 20 points.
Politicians send the Democratic party a little superior.
U.S. Considering the punishment of El Salvador for supporting Tyeongkok, then retreating
Diplomats make sure that the Dominican Republic and Panama have recognized Beijing, by giving a little pressure from Washington.
President Trump held a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and ordered hotels in Panama until the partner expelled the Trump Organization management team.
The Department of Foreign Affairs decided to pull back the head of the U.S. diplomatic mission from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over "the latest decision that no longer recognizes Taiwan," Heather Nauert, the department spokesperson, posted in a statement earlier this month.
But punishment is only considered against El Salvador, who has received some $140 million from the United States in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed punishment, which includes the seizure of financial aid and the restriction of visas targeted, will harm the Central American country and raise the level of unemployment and murder.
As internal meetings continue, North and Central American officials postpone high-level conferences focusing on security and economic prosperity to continue the same meeting last year that was considered a step forward to prevent migrants from entering the United States.
But in mid-September, senior government officials confirmed that they wanted a conference to continue, so that the effective end of the sentence of El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is currently scheduled to give a speech at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a government import signal at the meeting, reveals diplomats.
And three American envoys secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without bringing new counsel or severe punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesperson for Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate outlined by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal assessment of this unclear situation.
Their statements were reinforced by outside analysts close to government and also by talking about this unclear situation.
Study Story
Another shocking story is a special adviser Robert Mueller's report on the possible obstruction of Mr. Trump's court, which currently has very important evidence in public records.
Mr. Mueller's report also discusses the investigation into whether Trump's campaign is collusion with Russia in attacking our general election.
When Congress moves hand in hand, Mr. Trump will be asked for responsibility from him, just as he prepares to go again in front of the voters, and perhaps eventually become a jury of his partners.
That is why there is still much to be done, and I do not intend to suggest that the fall of Mr. Trump's rule cannot be avoided - or his equality in Europe.
There's a choice we should make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long we fight.
In 1938 the German officials were ready to perform a coup against Hitler, if only the West were against him and to support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We've failed, and missed the opportunity to avoid the next years of slaughter.
The beginning of history is centered on such a hijacking point, and democracy is accelerated or postponed.
Now the Americans are facing some of these changes.
What should we do if Trump fired Deputy Attorney-General Rod Rosenstein, the man who oversees the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been under pressure since this paper reported that, last year, he suggested secretly recording the president and arguing that he wasn't worthy of the president.
Mr. Rosenstein said The Times accounts aren't true.
"How do we respond if the F.B.I. investigation that Brett Kavanaugh has just been asked is incomplete or fair--or if he's brought to the Supreme Court even though there are strong allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And besides, are we going to give a part-time vote for Congress who will ask Trump for responsibility?
If we fail to pass that test, democracy will get worse in the long run.
But I believe we'll succeed, because the lesson I've learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakia Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once inhabited my great embassy.
He survived, then immigrated to America and, 60 years later, asked me to light the Sabbath candles on the table with a sophistication.
By leaving that legacy to me, how do I lose hope about our future?"

Rangers 'Graham Dorrans felt optimistic about the fight against Rapid Vienna
Rangers met Rapid Vienna on Thursday, winning over Austria, following good results in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will strengthen their position to escape the G League European Group.
The knee injury made the middle corner of Graham Dorrans impossible to perform in the first season until the 2-point results against Villarreal, but he was convinced that Rangers could take advantage of the result as a stepping stone to greater hope.
"This point is very good for us because Villarreal is a great team," said the 31-year-old player.
"In this game we're sure we can get something and go by one point.
In the end, we may be able to do it but, we believe, the results of the changes may be fair.
In the first round, they might be doing better but in the second round, we got up and became a better team.
On Thursday night, it became another great European day.
We hope to reach three points even though it's going to be a tough match because they have good results in their last match, but, with support behind us, I'm sure we can keep moving forward and achieve positive results.
Last year, we had a hard time, because of my injuries and changes in the club itself, but right now there is a very good hope in this club.
This squad is good and the kids really enjoy it. It's good practice.
May we now thrive, put the past behind us and achieve success."

Although it turns out that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, only a few people were discussing it with their family members.
About half of the people in nationwide studies discuss long-term care costs with their spouses.
Only 10 percent of them said to discuss this with their children.
"They want family members to provide care, but there's no way to start the discussion," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the nationwide life insurance business.
Here's the time to start.
Start talking to your spouse and children: You will not be able to prepare your own family to provide care if you do not first inform your wishes.
Be content with your family counselors, where and how you get treatment, because your choice will mean that it is very important to determine the cost.
Include your financial advisor: your advisor can certainly help you in showing you how to pay those fees.
Your chosen long-term care allowance includes traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid cash insurance policy that guarantees these expenses or ensures yourself with your wealth - as long as you have money.
Show your legal documents: Face an impertinent legal debate.
Show immediate power to your health care, that is, someone you trust to ensure your health care and ensure that your wishes are carried out by professional people when you are unable to communicate.
Moreover, a letter of power in your financial matters should also be considered.
Someone who trusts you to take care of all the financial decisions you have to choose, other than to make sure that your bills are paid if you can't.
Always remember with every detail as little as possible: Just imagine when your aged parents are in an emergency and on their way to the hospital.
Are you prepared to answer questions about treatment or allergies?
Write down such details so you're ready to answer.

A man shot a wind rifle at Ilfracombe
A man was shot with a wind rifle on his way home from a night party.
The 40-year-old victim was in Oxford Grove, Ilfracombe, Devon, when a few shots were fired at his chest, stomach, and hands.
The shooting event was described by the officer at about 2:30 a.m. BST, and it's said as "random action."
The victim didn't see who attacked him.
The injuries suffered by the victim did not threaten his soul and a number of witnesses have been filed by the police.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
The earthquake and tsunami struck the city of Palu, Indonesia, last Friday, had eliminated at least 384 souls, revealed the officers, and the number of deaths was estimated to increase.
The breakup of the communication made the officers who channeled assistance difficulties obtaining information from the Donggala County, a region north of the Palu city that was closer to the earthquake center that hit with 7.5 scale Richter.
In the Palu, after the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated.
Below are some main facts about the city of Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
The tree was the capital of the Middle Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population estimated to be 379,800 in 2017.
When earthquakes and tsunamis hit, this city was celebrating its 40th birthday.
Donggala, in the meantime, was a county of more than 300 km (180 miles) from the coastline on the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
This county, which is an administrative area under the province, is estimated to have 299,200 souls in 2017.
The economic eye of the South Sulawesi province is looking for fish and growing, especially on the coast of Donggala.
However, the existence of important nickel mining also plays a role in this province, although most of its focus is in Morowali, across the Sulawesi coast.
Recorded over the past 100 years, Palu and Donggala have several times been hit by tsunamis, based on data from the Indonesian Disaster Response Agency.
In 1938, over 200 people died in a tsunami disaster and hundreds of homes in Donggala fell.
In 1996, nine people died in a tsunami disaster in western Donggala.
In a seismic manner, Indonesia is located on the Pacific Firecin and as a result, earthquakes will occur in an orderly manner.
A number of large earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in the past few years are as follows:
Year 2004: December 26, Indonesia was struck by a major earthquake, precisely on the west coast of Aceh Province, in northern Sumatra, which also triggered a tsunami in 14 countries, until 226,000 lives were destroyed along the Indian Ocean, and more than half of the victims died in Aceh.
2005: At the end of March and early April, an equally powerful earthquake struck the west coast of Sumatra.
On Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra, hundreds of people were reported dead.
2006: The 6.8 - powerful earthquake hit southern Java, the densest island in Indonesia, triggering tsunamis on the southern coast and resulting in nearly 700 people dying worldwide.
2009: An earthquake struck 7.6 near the city of Wang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
The victim died more than 1,100 people.
The year 2010: One island on the islands of Ottawa, beyond Sumatra, was also struck with a 7.5 - strong earthquake, triggering a tsunami of some 30 feet [10 m] high that once struck tens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: Pidie Jaya, Aceh, also experienced a shallow earthquake and caused destruction, as well as the panic of those who remembered the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunamis in 2004.
Although this time there is no tsunami potential, more than 100 people died as a result of the collapse of buildings.
2018: Lombok, which is called a tourist island, also suffered a major earthquake that killed more than 500 people, where most of them on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake caused thousands of buildings and while scattering thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, Sarah Palin's eldest son, former governor Alaska and vice president's candidate, has been arrested despite the attack.
Palin, 29 years old, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for domestic violence, obstructed domestic violence reports and countered arrest efforts, as reported by the Alaska State Police on Saturday.
According to the police report, when a woman's acquaintance tried to call the police to report a suspected crime, she took the phone call from the woman.
Palin was handed over to Mat-Su Pretrial Prison, with $500 fines without bail, as reported by the KT.
As reported in the news, Palin attended the trial on Saturday, declared himself "innocent, as certain as he was" when asked about his defense.
Palin faced three minor violations of Class A, which could make him subject to one year's imprisonment and a fine of $250,000.
In addition, he was also charged with Class B criminal charges, with a single day's imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
For Palin, criminal charges are not the first time.
In December 2017, he was accused of an attack on his father, Todd Palin.
Her own mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report on the suspicion of the attack.
The case is currently referred to the Alaskan Veterinary Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, barred from reporting domestic violence crimes, and possession of firearms in a drunken state, which was also related to the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of looking at his face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was vexed by a group of veterans associated violence against her son with PTSD as a result of her duties in Iraq.
Tsunami and earthquakes in Indonesia: hundreds of victims died
On Friday, the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia was struck by a massive earthquake until at least 384 victims died.
A 7.5 - magnitude earthquake that potentially triggered a tsunami has swept away thousands of homes.
Electricity networks and communication connections have been broken, and death rates are projected to continue to increase over the next few days.
The earthquake then struck the central Sulawesi, which lay in the eastern Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
Videos that show how terrible those moments of disaster spread across social media.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu at the time, when the tsunami broke the beach.
Federal prosecutors are paying a death sentence that rarely occurs to the suspect of a terror attack in NYC
The federal prosecutor in New York paid the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in a terror attack in New York City, where eight people were killed -- that was rare and had not been done in the federal crime-related state since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, was suspected of an assault by striking a truck hired from Home Depot on foot and riding a bicycle on a bicycle track along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, in October.
In order to justify this death sentence, the prosecutors must provide evidence that Saipov "in will" killed the eight victims and "in will" also caused serious bodily injury, based on a declaration of will to punish the death penalty, which was submitted to the South District of New York.
According to the court documents, the two charges allowed to be sentenced to death.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal jury's board of directors set up Saipov with 22 charges, including eight charges of murder in the conduct of extortion, which is usually used by the federal prosecutor in the case of organized crime, as well as the charge of violence and the attempt to destroy motor vehicles.
According to the prosecutor, the attack requires "substantial planning and early release," as a description of Saipov's crime of "wrong, cruel, and barbaric."
"Sayfulllo Habibullaevovic Saipov has caused injury, danger, and loss to family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco."
Five victims on the incident were tourists from Argentina.
Counted a decade since the South District of New York dropped the death sentence last time.
In September 2009, Khalid Barnes, the defendant of murder of two drug dealers, was finally sentenced to life imprisonment.
The last execution of the death penalty at the federal court in New York in 1953, was handed down in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple of husbands convicted of espionage conspiracy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg couple were executed with an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, from Uzbekistan, does not express the sense of regret as it goes on day and month after the attack.
When asked by investigators, he said that he was happy with what he had done, sent off the police.
Saipov also reveals to the authorities that his attack was inspired by the ISIS video he watched from his phone, as the defendant said.
He also asked the ISIS flag to be placed in his hospital room, the police.
He declared himself guilty of the 22 counts that he had been charged with.
David Patton, a federal public defender representing Saipov, said "clearly disappointed" about the prosecution's decision.
"In our opinion, the decision to execute the death sentence is not to accept a life sentence of imprisonment without bail will only extend the trauma of those involved in the incident," Patton said.
Previously, the Saipov defense team had appealed to the prosecutor not to execute a death sentence.
NIGEL FARAGE is responsible for Brexit negotiations, says Tory MP
Nigel Farage called for today's 'movement of the civil servants' in protest at the Tory conference.
The former leader of the Ukip said that politicians should 'feel the heat' Eurosceptics - because one of the members of parliament, Theresa May, suggests that they be involved in negotiating with the EU.
Conservative group supporters, Peter Bone, told street action in Birmingham that England should 'be out' right now if Farage were to act as Secretary Brexit.
However, the challenge facing May in the reconciliation of his shared position has been borne by the support of the Tories Remain that joins in the separate protest protest protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister fought to maintain his Chequers compromise plan to remain on his track even in the middle of the Brexiteers, Remainers and the European Union.
Allied countries stress that he will be moved forward to reach a deal with Brussels, even if he gets a bad reaction -- and force Eurosceptics and Workers to decide the choice between his proposal package and his 'failure'.
Bone told the Leave Means Leave mass in Solihull that he wanted to 'remove the Chequers.
The suggestion was that Farage should appoint a partner to be given responsibility in negotiating with Brussels.
"If the responsibility remains with him, we'll be out now," he said.
Members of the Wellingborough Parliament added: "I'm ready to stand up for Brexit, but we need to get rid of the Chequers."
He said to the European Union: "We fight not in the war of the world to be submissive.
We want to set our own laws in our own country.'
Bone concludes that potential public opinion has led to changes since the 2016 election: "The idea that the British people's thinking has changed and wanted a steady state, that's absolutely not true."
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns, who is also involved in the mass action, posted to the reporter: 'Simple, I want to say: "O dear Prime Minister, listen to your people.
"Cchequers are not popular among the generals, but the opposition will not choose them, because they are not popular with our parties and our activists who really come down to the road and make us elected in the first position.
Our request, get rid of the Chequers and start listening to us.'
By a message addressed to May, he added: "The Prime Minister maintains their work when their promise is fulfilled."
Farage said that political demonstration had to be disrupted in order to 'feel the heat' if they wanted to break the 2016 referendum decision.
‘This most valuable time is trust between our peoples and our political groups,’ he said.
'They tried to deny Brexit and here we are today, confirming to them that 'we won't let you escape to do that'.
He also added in a message to the enthusiastic crowd: 'I want you to make our political groups, who are preparing to deny Brexit, also feel the heat.
'We're moving this country's people's ranks that will win us in Brexit and will never give up until the independent, self-evident, and proud Britannia arrives.'
Meanwhile, the Player masses moved through Birmingham before ringing action in the city center for two hours.
The line of activists appears to spread the banner of Tories Against Brexit after setting up its line at the end of this week.
Fellows in the Labour Line, Lord Adonis, ridiculed conservative groups regarding the security issue of their party's application when the conference was opened.
‘These people were the ones who told us that they could master the IT system and all the technology for Canada, whatever, for the anti-slip border, in the boundless free trade network in Ireland,’ his womb.
‘ I was on a team show.
At all, there's no good Brexit,' his guts.
Warren's planning to make a 'serious strike' on the president's behalf.
Senator Elizabeth Warren said he was going to break the president's nominee after the election in November.
Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democratic Party declared its future at the city hall in Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who was often challenged by President Donald Trump, called for a reelection in November against state GOP representatives, Geoff Diehl, the vice president of Trump's campaign in 2016 in Massachusetts.
In national speculation, he was marked as opposing Trump by 2020.
The meeting on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was the 36th with the voters, who had been called the city hall format since Trump's appointment.
A contestant asked him a question, whether there was any plan to recommend himself as president.
Warren said that this is the right time "for women to enter the Washington circle to restore our broken government, and that is when women are at the top."
Arrested by Sims shooter, LSU player
On Saturday, Baton Rouge police, Louisiana, announced that the suspect of the shooting had been arrested and caused the death of Wayde Sims, a basketball player from LSU, on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested at 11 a.m. at the ET press conference.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, where an identified man asked for help as seen in the footage.
Friday morning, Sims, 20 years old, was shot and found dead near the Southern University campus.
"Wayde Sims suffered a head injury and eventually died," said Murphy J. Paul, chief of police, to the media on Saturday, through 247sports.
Wayde was trying to protect his friend and Simpson shot him.
When interrogated, Simpson claims to be at the scene of the incident, holding a firearm, and shooting him towards Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without a significant resistance and imprisoned in custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A junior player with a height of 6 feet 6 inches, grew up in Baton Rouge, that's Sims figure, has played in 32 games with 10 beginnings last season and average 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 balls behind each match.
Agang Grand Prix in Russia: Lewis Hamilton wins the world after the team admits his victory over Sebastian Vettel
Everything became clear when Valtteri Bottas was in front of Lewis Hamilton in a single qualification on Saturday that would bring orders from the Mercedes team to have a great role in the race.
From the pole, Bottas had a good starting position and almost left Hamilton because he maintained his position at the first two and pulled Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to go into the pit and let Hamilton move into the mass at the end of the crowd, something that should be highly determined.
Mercedes entered pit one lap after and left after Vettel, but Hamilton continued to move after some pursuit that showed Ferrari's driver's restraint left the part in blank with a risk of survival after double movement to survive in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started the start on the back grid and was in seventh position at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led most of the races because he held off the tire replacement to target the quick completion and took over the position of Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth position.
He finally went into pit in the 44th lap but couldn't improve his step in the remaining eight laps because finally Raikkonen took fourth position.
It's a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and a real man who let me.
Team has done an amazing job to have one two," says Hamilton.
It's a Very Bad Body Language
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein in a relic on Saturday through his village, he didn't leak a letter from Christine Blasey Ford about the sentence of sexual violence against the future Judge Great Brett Kavanaugh
Speaking in a relic in West Virginia, the president did not directly make statements by Ford before the Senate Court Committee, rather than comment on what was happening in the Senate that showed people "bad and corrupt and dishonest and dishonest."
"Something that can happen and something beautiful that's been happening for the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and evil and sick and dishonest and dishonest," he said.
"When you saw the passage and the leak then they said "oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember the answer... did you leak the document-- "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak it."
Okay, hold on a second.
Did we leak... no, we didn't leak it," he added, as an impression of the senator.
Feinstein had sent a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh by Ford last July, and it had leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein argued that the leak did not come from his office.
"I'm not hiding Dr. Ford's charges, I'm not leaking the story," said Feinstein against the committee, delivered Hill.
"He asked me to keep it secret and I kept it secret as he asked."
But his rejection was not approved by the president, who commented during the relic on Saturday night: "I will tell you, it's really a very bad body language.
Maybe he didn't do it, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing his defense against the future High Judge, who was accused of sexual harassment against three women, the president was impressed with the statement that the Democrats used charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take over power in various ways.
You see crime, malice, they don't care who they hurt, what they have to walk for power and oversight," mediaite report on the president's speech.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants when dealing with Dundee
Dundee Stars paid off defeat on Friday at the Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 prize match on Saturday.
Giant got two goals ahead of two strikes from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought a balanced housekeeper before Dwyer returned the top Giants.
Francois Bouchard named the position for Dundee before two goals Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured their victory.
It's the defeat of the Third Elite League this season of Adam Keefe's men, who succeeded in pursuing the legacy and finally enlisted to defeat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
That's the fourth meeting this season between the two sides, with three Giants wins in the previous match.
The opener of Dwyer was present in the fourth minute at 3:35 from Kendall McFaull’s bait, with David Rutherford giving bait when Beauvillier succeeded in multiplying the top four minutes after that.
In the thick opening period, Sullivan took the host back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became the baiter for the adjustment made by Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured the improvement of Giants at the time of the first pause when the goal of the second night was left at the end of the first period.
The host of the house reunited and Bouchard again balanced their position with the goal of power play at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give the Dundee the lead for the first time at the end of the match in the second period and he ensured victory with his team in the middle of the fifth during the final period.
Giants, who have so far suffered four defeats of their five matches, are in the cage to face Milton Keynes at their next match on Friday.
Airborne Drivers Died to Ensure Hundreds of Passengers in Safe Ships From Earthquakes
An air traffic guide in Indonesia was summoned as a hero after his death while ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of passengers could fly safely.
More than 800 people have died in the world and many others have disappeared after a major earthquake hit the Sulawesi Islands on Friday, triggering the tsunami.
The powerful earthquake continues to shake the area and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
But despite his associates fleeing for their safety, 21-year-old Anthonius the Great Gunawan refused to leave his post in a heavy-wounded driving tower at Sis Al Jufri Airport, Palu.
He chose to survive to make sure the 6321 Air Battage flight was on the runway at the time, to be able to take off safely.
He then jumped off the traffic guide tower when he felt the tower was falling.
He died after he was in the hospital.
Speaker of the Indonesian Flight Navigation Services Agency, Johannes Siriat, delivered his decision to save hundreds of lives, reports from ABC Australia.
We provided a helicopter from Balykpapan in California to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached the tree.
"We're all sad to hear this," he added.
Meanwhile, the authority worried that the victim might die could reach thousands after the National Disaster Relief Agency provided access to Donggala, Sigi, and Boutong.
"The carcass is still expected to continue to grow because of the many bodies of victims that are still in ruins and many others that cannot be achieved," said the national body spoke of the disaster striker Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The waves that reach six meters have made the pole fall tall that caused the mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and various supplies.
A 35-year-old mother named Kusuma told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance carries a body.
Clean water becomes rare.
Minimarkets are everywhere in custody"
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Cross Indonesia works hard to help the survivors but we don't know what they're going to find there.
It's been a tragedy, but it can probably get worse."
President Indonesia Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and asked the Indonesian national army: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete the entire evacuation-related task.
Ready?" CNN report.
Indonesia was also hit by an earthquake in Lombok that killed more than 550 people earlier this year.
Mikronesia plane crash: Water Niugini conveys one missing person after the lagoon plane accident
The air carrier operated a flight that fell into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia and sent one person to disappear, after which 47 passengers and crew had been evacuated safely from the sinking plane.
The Niugini water delivered at a Saturday afternoon release, on which it was unable to identify a male passenger.
The airline said its side had cooperated with the local authority, the hospital and the examiner to find the guy.
The airline does not respond quickly to a more detailed request about the passenger, such as his age or citizenship.
Local boats helped rescue passengers and other crews, after the plane hit the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday, the officer informed me that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline delivered the remaining six passengers to the hospital on Saturday, and they were all in stable condition.
What caused the accident and sequence of events is still unclear.
The U.S. Navy and airline states that the aircraft landed on the lagoons around the runway.
Some witnesses felt that the plane crossed the runway.
American passengers Bill Jaynes said the plane came very low.
"That's really a good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and the others managed to drain the water at the height of the belt through the emergency exit on the sinking plane.
He told the flight attendants panicked and shouted, and he suffered a little head injury.
The U.S. Navy says that fishermen who work close to the repaired docks also help rescue using rubber boats to transport people to land before the plane sinks at the depths of about 30 meters (100 feet) in the water.
The data from the Flight Security Network indicates 111 people have died in the world's registered company-PNG accident for the past two decades but none of them have involved Niugini Water.
Analysts reveal the women's nightline burned alive
The arrest of something that happened on Saturday in re-examination of a man who was accused of doing a life-burning burn against a Mississippi woman in 2014.
Analyst U.S. Department of Justice Paul Rowlett witnessed for several hours as an expert witness in intelligence analysis.
He made a big line for the jury about how he used cell phone footage to gather the various movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of his death.
Rowlett said he received the location data from some cell phone that showed Tellis was in one location with Chambers on the night of his death, compared to the defendant's previous statement, explained Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed the defendant's cell phone was in one location with Chambers during that time, he argued that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police finally asked for an explanation from Sanford.
Sanford followed the trial on Saturday and he testified that he was not in the city on the day of the incident.
When the defendant asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said that he was in the Sanford truck on the night of the incident, Sanford said he was "liest, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistence that Tellis uttered was his statement that he knew Chambers about two weeks to the death of the victim.
Cell phone records indicate they know each other within a week.
Rowlett submits that after Chambers' death, Tellis sometimes deletes messages, calls and contacts from Chambers' phone.
"He eliminates the victim from his life," said Hale.
The announcement is scheduled to begin the closing statement on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped the trial would lead to the jury after that day.
What's the hip hop spirit?
A trio hip hop group wants to challenge the negative view of those genres by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims hip hop moves away from the origin of political messages and raises social issues.
They want to go back to its roots and make hip hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently seen a resurrection in the UK through some artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black guy?
NY's nanny is demanding a couple for attacking after sending out a "racial" message.
A nurse in New York sued a couple for having attacked discriminatively after receiving an indirect message from a mother who complained and stated that she was "another black man."
The couple refused if they considered them to be racist, and considered it more like "glorification."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, showed her anxiety when she realized that the new child care provider, Giselle Maurice, was her only black skin after she was on her first day of work in 2016.
"Don't let anyone else," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she even sent it to Miss Maurice, twice.
After realizing her mistake, "unpleasant" Plasco-Flaxman fired Miss Maurice, stated that they took out the nanny, who was an African-American mixed citizen, because he had done an ugly job and he expected the Philippines more, based on the New York Post.
Miss Maurice was paid one day at work and was later returned to Uber.
At the moment, Maurice is demanding compensation for the dismissal, and seeks compensation for about $350 a day for the six-month period, in return for the child care job that he first had to work on, although without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you can't do anything like that," he said to the post on Sunday, then add "I know it's discrimination."
The couple against the claim that they were racist, saying that the fired worker Maurice was a reasonable thing to do, they were afraid that they could not believe him after offending him.
"My wife has sent something she doesn't mean.
He's not a racist.
We're not racist," Joel Plasco's husband said to the Post.
"But can you let your children be cared for by someone you've been rude to, even if it's just a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Like she was wrapped up in "glorious," says her wife Plasco just two months ago gave birth to her baby and was in "a very difficult situation."
"You're going after someone who's in such a condition?
It's not a good thing to do," investment bank adds.
When legal cases are still in progress, the public court has made a quick indictment of the couple on social media, blaming their attitude and logic.
Publisher Paddington worried the reader wouldn't have anything to do with a talking bear, new newspaper revealed
His daughter Bond, Karen Jankel, was born not long after his book was received, explained in a letter. "It was very difficult to speak only without knowing what position he had, to read it first before it was published.
It's so funny to know how we know about the great success of Paddington."
Said his father, who was a BBC cameraman before inspiring through the writing of children's books with bear toys, who was very optimistic about the results of his work that had been rejected, he added the 60th anniversary of the book publication that felt "sweet grief" after his father's death last year.
For Paddington, whom he described as "the most important member of our family," he added his father was quite proud of his success.
"He's quite quiet, and he's not proud," he said.
"But because Paddington means a lot to him, it's like you have a child who's achieved something: you're proud of them even though not all your efforts.
I think he looks at Paddington's success like that.
Though it is the result of his creation and imagination, he always gives praise to Paddington himself."
My daughter is dying and I have to say good-bye to her by phone
By the time she landed, her daughter was immediately taken to the hospital in Nice Louis Pasteur 2, but the doctors failed to save her.
"Nad made a quiet call to convey it was really bad. That she probably wouldn't survive," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperuse.
"Then I got a call from Nad stating he would die in two minutes ahead and he asked me to say goodbye to him.
And I did too.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, baby.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs doctors have given her to keep her heart beating slowly, slowly running out and leaving her body system.
He's been dead a while while the handling process went on and everything feels dead.
I can just sit there and wait, understand all this has been revealed.
I can't cry, either scream or cry because I'm in a situation that's surrounded by families and people.
I really have to hold it all."
Finally Mrs. Ednan-Laperuse, now grieving over the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers - without realizing what had gone through it.
"No one knows," he said.
"My head is drowsy and my tears keep dripping all the time.
It's very difficult to explain, but when I was on the flight, I felt such deep sympathy for Nad.
That he needs love and understanding from me.
I know how much he loves her."
The grieving women posted cards to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost loved ones tried to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted cards on a bridge in Welsh with inspiring messages and numbers that can be connected to get support.
The son of Mrs. Davis, Tyler, was 13 years old when he started to suffer from depression and suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel like I feel every day," he said.
Mrs. Davis, aged 45, who lives in Lydney, says that her son is a chef who promises with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knows him from his smile.
They always say that their smiles sparkle the atmosphere."
But, he quit working before he died, like he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Brother Tyler, who was 11 years old at the time, was the one who found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis said, "I keep worrying if there will be any lasting effects."
Mrs. Davis made those cards, "to tell people that there's someone else out there that you can come and talk, even if they're a friend.
Don't sit down and shut up - you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, his partner for 15 years, shortly after her mother died.
"He didn't say if he felt sad or depressed or anything," he said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was at his lowest point on Christmas Day - when the children opened their gift he didn't look into their eyes or anything."
He said his death was a great trauma to them, but they had to go through it: "That makes a hole in the family.
It separates us.
But we have to go through it and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh was in uncertainty when the FBI began its investigation.
"I think, if we really get something like what he asked for--a time-limited investigation, limited its scope--we might be able to bring a little unity," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid of the "damaged" committee in the middle of the council decision.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their rejection is due to time.
The legislative elections remain five weeks later, on November 6th - if, as expected, the Republic does badly, they will become very weak in its opportunity to get the people they want to be chosen to sit in the highest court there.
George W. Bush has contacted the Senators, lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who works at the White House for Mr. Bush and through him meets with his wife Ashley, who is personal secretary Mr. Bush.
What happened after the FBI made the report?
There will be an election in the Senate, where 51 republics and 49 Democrats sit.
It is still unclear if Mr. Kavanaugh could get at least 50 votes between the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to determine the winner and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
Number of North Koreans 'anjlok' under Kim
The number of people who relocated from North Korea to South Korea has declined dramatically since Kim Jong-un was in power seven years ago, beating up a member of the Democratic Korean parliament.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the Southern Ministry's data, said there were 1,127 evictions last year -- compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that border control between North Korea and Tyeongkok and higher rates charged by smugglers is the key factor.
Pyongyang didn't give a public comment.
Most Northers were eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul said over 30,000 people from North Korea have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them run through the Tiongkok, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the Demilitarization Zone between the two Koreas.
They often forced their return to their homes because of the illegal immigration of refugees.
The relationship between the North and the South - which is technically still in the war - has increased dramatically in the past few months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on the pending denuklirisation negotiations.
This happened after a historic meeting in June between the President of the United States Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in the broad sense to work together on a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, Foreign Minister of North Korea Ri Yong-ho blames US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Unless we trust the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and in that situation, there will be no way we will drop our weapons sideways," Mr. Ri said in a speech in the General Assembly of the United Nations in New York.
Nancy Pelosi accuses Brett Kavanaugh "hissteris," says he's not fit to serve in the Supreme Court
The opposition leader Nancy Pelosi accused Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of "hissteris" and said he was not in a temperate position to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made that comment in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if a woman performs like that, they'll say 'hissteris'," Pelossi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's witness in front of the Judicial Council Commission on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally protested the accusation that she had been sexually harassing Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both in their teens.
In his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and having trouble talking when discussing his family and his years during high school.
He also frankly condemns Democrat in the committee, saying that the accusation against him is "inconceivable and coordinated murder" organized by the angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost in the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said he believed that Kavanaugh’s witness had proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he was guilty of the Democrat.
"I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and with his attitude toward Clinton and Democrat," he said.
Pelosius says he's gonna try to sue if he's approved, and if Democrat gets more votes at the Council of People's Representatives.
"I would say this -- if he didn't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, then he wouldn't fit not only to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he is now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is now a judge at the D.C. High Court.
Pelosi added that he was a Democrat he was worried about the potential of Kavanaugh's decision against the Health Service or Roe v. Wade, because he was seen as conservative justice.
In the branch, Kavanaugh avoided the question of whether he would overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not the time for someone who is hysterical and biased to go to court and expect us to say, 'It's not so great,' said Pelosi.
And women need to handle it.
It was an ethical claw, anger for months and years, and he couldn't get it out without crying.
"We cried when we were angry, Miss Steinem told me 45 years later.
"In my opinion it's not weird, what do you think?"
He continued: "I am greatly helped by a woman who is an executive somewhere, who says that she also cries when she is angry, but develops a technique that means that she is angry and starts crying, she will say to the man who is speaking to her, "You may think I am sad because I am crying.
I'm angry."
And then he went on.
And I think it's brilliant."
The tears were shed as a way out of anger partly because he was basically misunderstood.
One of my strongest memories of the early work, in the office dominated by men, once I cried with unspeakable anger, was my neck held tight by an older woman - a cold manager who was always a little scared - who dragged me to the stairs.
"Don't ever let them see you cry," he told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and will be happy because they think they're successful."
Patricia Schroeder, a member of the Colorado convention, worked with Gary Hart in the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an affair outside of marriage on a boat called Monkey Business and resigned from the election, Miss Schroeder, very frustrated, understood that there was no reason for himself not to run for office as president.
"It wasn't a mature decision," he said to me laughing 30 years later.
"There were seven other candidates in the election, and the last thing they needed was a new candidate.
Someone called her "Salve Princess and Seven Dwarf."
Because he was already late in the campaign, he remained in the fundraiser, and so he swore he would not follow the election unless he managed to collect two million dollars.
It's a final battle in defeat.
He found that some of his supporters gave $1,000 to men only $250.
"Do they think I got a discount?" she wondered.
When he spoke, he announced that he was not going to launch a formal campaign, he was too overwhelmed by the emotions--thanks to those who supported him, frustration with the system that made the fundraiser so difficult and to target voters from the delegation, and anger against sexism-- made it difficult to speak.
"You might think that I'm too nervous," recalls Miss Schroeder about how the press reacted to her.
"You'll think that Kleinex is my sponsor's company.
I remember, think, what would they write in my nest?
"Does she cry?"
How the US-Tiongkok trade competition may be good for Beijing
The open trade competition between the United States and Thailand was so intense, and while the fight was still far from the end, the gap between the two countries might be beneficial for Beijing in the long run, according to experts.
Donald Trump, U.S. President, fired the first warning earlier this year by taxing Tiongkok's key export goods including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
A very significant reward was made this week with a new rate that affects the worth of $200 billion ($150 billion), effectively taxing half of all the goods that enter the U.S. through Tiongkok.
Beijing has responded every time, recently had a five to ten percent rate on American items worth $60 billion.
Tiongkok has pleaded to unite the US one-by-one, and the world's second largest economy will not change in the near future.
Leading Washington to retreat means following the will, but publicly opposing the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, President Tiongkok.
Still, experts say that if Beijing can play its cards correctly, U.S. trade competition pressures can positively support Tyeongkok in the long run by reducing the dependence between the two economies.
"The fact that rapid political decisions by Washington or Beijing can create conditions that trigger economic movements in both countries are more likely to be more dangerous than what observers have previously learned," said Abigail Grace, a fellow researcher who focuses on Asia in the Center for New American Security, an expert agency.
Syria 'prepared' for the return of refugees, according to Foreign Minister
Syria said that they were ready to return voluntarily and offer help in rebuilding the country that had been destroyed by more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the conditions in his country were improving.
"Today's situation in the field is more stable and safe thanks to progress in combating terrorism," he says.
The government continued to rehabilitate the areas that were destroyed by terrorists to restore it to its original form.
All conditions are present now because refugees voluntarily return to the country they have to leave because of terrorism and a comprehensive economic decision that makes their daily lives and livelihoods as targets.
The United Nations estimates more than 5.5 million Syrians have been exiled from their country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would receive help to rebuild a devastated country.
But he stressed that they would not receive any conditional aid or help from the countries that supported the rebellion.
Europe ensures the victory of the Ryder Cup in Paris

It's a tough year.
Thank you very much to Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm so happy, so happy to get the trophy back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I can help," said Garcia who was emotional after European victory.

There was this morning when we made it difficult for Europe.
We had a fight.
Greetings to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players play very well.
We'll reassemble, I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll step forward.
I love these 12 men and I'm proud to be captain.
You have to give honor.
We're losing our superiority."
