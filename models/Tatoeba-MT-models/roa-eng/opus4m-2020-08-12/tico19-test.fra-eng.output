Rapid increase in the cumulative incidence of coronary artery disease (COVID-19) within the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom between 1 January and 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows a similar trend in the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, confirming that, although it is at different stages, the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly across all countries.
According to Italy's experience, countries, hospitals and intensive care services need to prepare for a peak of patients with COVID-19 requiring care, particularly intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, a home of unknown etiology pneumonia was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Centre for Disease Prevention and Control designated the responsible agent as a new coronavirus now known as coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronary artery disease (COVID-19).
To date, approximately 80% of people with VOCID-19 have a benign condition, i.e. respiratory infection with or without pneumonia, most of which are cured.
In approximately 14 per cent of cases, COVID-19 leads to a more severe injury requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6 per cent of cases develop a serious form of the disease requiring intensive care.
Mortality of patients hospitalized due to VOCID-19 is approximately 4%.
As part of this study, we assess the evolution of the cumulative impact of COVID-19 in each of the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (U.S.), and compare it with the developments in the Province of Hubei, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom with that of Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
After China, COVID-19 continued to spread, and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world are now following that of the country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that COVID-19 was a pandemic.
In the issue of 5 March of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported the first cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Europe according to the WHO case definition.
Within the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in persons returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As at 15 March 2020, cases of COVID-19 were detected in each of the 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (U.S.) with 39,768 reported deaths and 1,727 reported deaths between 31 December 2019 and 1,750 cases and 1,441 deaths for Italy alone.
Obtaining the cumulative number and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECPCM), the number of COVID-19 cases reported in each country worldwide, obtained only from official sources such as ministries of health, national and regional health authorities of different countries and WHO, is updated daily at 08:00.
These data were used to assess the evolution of COVID-19 within the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, and to compare with Italy's experience.
In order to assess the prevalence of active cases of COVID-19, we calculated the cumulative 14-day incidence of COVID-19, taking into account the natural evolution of COVID-19, within each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom, for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also compared the cumulative number of cases reported in each country at 8 a.m. on 15 March 2020 with Italy's data for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Development of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
The trend in the cumulative 14-day incidence of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom generally followed the incidence of Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, the cumulative impact of COVID-19 began to grow around 21 February before a drastic increase occurred around 28 February 2020 (additional data).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of cases reported in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom presented a similar increase in the cumulative impact of COVID-19 (additional data).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom compared with Italy's data for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It is noted that, by 15 March at 8 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom had already reported a total number of cases comparable to that of Italy only 3 weeks before or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is increasing rapidly within the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
The evolution of the cumulative impact of COVID-19 suggests that the pandemic progresses at a comparable rate in all countries.
And this is despite the fact that countries are at different stages and that there are differences in the responses of national public health services, potential variations in case definitions and differences in the protocols for the selection of patients to be tested for COVID-19 confirmation, including for catch-up tests.
As early as March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy indicated that approximately 10% of patients with VOCID-19 required intensive care, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care services in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on admission of COVID-19 cases in hospitals and/or in intensive care are currently available across the EU/EEA for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data not presented).
However, systematic collection is required to complement current surveillance data focusing on the number of reported cases and deaths.
A study conducted in 2010-11 showed a significant variance in the number of beds available in intermediate and intensive care services in Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds per 100,000 individuals in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal.
This means that countries have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds in intensive and intermediate care per 100,000 individuals in 2010-11).
Modelling scenarios related to the saturation of care capacity, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom of the prevalence of hospitalized COVID-19 cases associated with a risk > 90% of the overcapacity in intensive care beds, are provided in the sixth update of the rapid assessment of COCM risk related to COVID-19.
Since cases have so far been grouped in certain regions of the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, and hospitals and intensive care services generally host a defined regional population, data on cases and beds in intensive care should preferably be established at level 2 of the Statistical Territorial Unit Nomenclature (NUTS 2).
Italy's experience and current developments in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly within the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care services must therefore prepare for a sustained community transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 as well as an increase in the number of patients with VOCID-19 requiring care, in particular intensive care, as in the affected regions of Italy.
As highlighted by the recent rapid risk assessment of the CEPCM, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2 by moving from an approach to a mitigation approach, as the rapid and early increase in the number of cases may not allow sufficient time for decision-makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly, if nothing has been implemented upstream.
The rapid risk assessment also identifies public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a brief window where each country can strengthen its control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on health services.
Otherwise, health systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to face a peak of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 Coronavirus Disease Epidemic (COVID-19), caused by Coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (RAS) (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in more than 3,000 deaths and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, causing a humanitarian disaster.
Like its counterpart, SARS-CoV, which resulted in thousands of SARS cases in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted by bats and causes similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has lower severity and mortality than SARS, but it is much more communicative, and it affects older people more than young people and more men than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on this emerging disease, this article seeks to provide a timely and comprehensive review of this growing research topic.
We will address the fundamentals of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and disease prevention.
While many questions are still waiting for answers, we hope that this review will help to better understand and eradicate this serious disease.
The Spring Festival, on January 25, 2020, has always marked the Chinese, who have been forced to remain closed for the entire golden week as well as for many other weeks due to the spread of a new viral disease.
The virus is highly homologous with coronavirus (CoV) which causes a severe acute respiratory syndrome (RAS) epidemic in 2003; that is why it was baptized SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and the associated disease called coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan and quickly spread to all China before expanding to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus had led to more than 80,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, with more than 40,000 patients hospitalized and more than 3,000 deaths.
For WHO, COVID-19 is "public enemy number 1", potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 works have been published on COVID-19, including in the areas of virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on 7 January 2020 presenting the virus sequence, isolated from several patients.
This review attempts to synthesize the progress of research on this emerging topic.
As soon as possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another coronary disease, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, an epidemic that took place in 2012).
We will also take stock of what we have learned so far in terms of the prevention and prediction of the disease, and we will address some still outstanding but urgent issues.
Coronaviruses are traditionally considered non-mortal pathogens for humans, mainly causing approximately 15% of common rums 4.
However, over the course of this century, we experienced two highly pathogenic coronaviruses for humans, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused an epidemic that began in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, before rapidly spreading to many other countries with high morbidity and mortality.
The current COVID-19 is thus the third epidemic of recent history's coronary artery.
As presented in Fig. Fig.1,1, household pneumonia then of unknown origin was first reported to Wuhan on December 31, 2019 to the National Health Commission.
Seven days later, the coronavirus sequence was revealed.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatal case was reported to Wuhan.
In the meantime, the epidemic had spread rapidly to neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, it was reported that health professionals had been infected, suggesting that interhuman transmission was possible.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan was placed in quarantine with interruption of all its public transport.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on the disease indicated that, out of 41 confirmed cases, only 21 patients had been in direct contact with the Wuhan Sea Fruit Market, considered as the starting point for infection with an unknown animal source.
On January 30, WHO called the global health emergency epidemic.
At the time of writing of this report, the disease had already spread to all China as well as to nearly 50 other countries around the world (Fig. (Fig.2).2).
As the situation evolves rapidly, the final scope and severity of the epidemic remain to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multicentre study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed cases of COVID-19, presented an updated overview of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qqq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but more of them in the 30-65 age group.
Nearly half (47.7%) of infected persons were over 50 years of age, very few were under 20 years of age, and only 14 were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/100 000) than women (0.27/100 000).
COVID-19 developed in households, mainly in the province of Hubei and in the periphery.
The mean duration between the onset of symptoms and the diagnosis of VOCID-19 was 5 days (2-9).
The mean incubation period was 4.8 days (2.0-7.2).
The mean duration between the onset of symptoms and death was 9.5 days (4.8-13).
The basic reproduction rate (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of people infected had increased exponentially until January 23, 2020, which coincided with the massive movements that took place before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality of patients identified as confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and the adjusted mortality of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors of VOCID-19 were gender (human), age (≥ 60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large enveloped viruses containing a simple ARN brin.
They can be classified into four types, namely alpha, beta, gamma and delta, the coronaviruses known to infect the alpha and beta-type humans.
The glycoprotein Spike (S) of the envelope binds to the angiotensin 2 (ACE2) converting enzyme and to the dipeptidyl peptide-4 (DPP4) of its cell receptors for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, then a membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA accompanied by envelope glycoproteins and nucleocapside proteins forms vesicles containing virions, which then merge with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was presented on January 10, 2020.
It has been established that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta-ronavirus, with more than 99.98% genetic identity among 10 sequenced samples taken at the site of origin of the epidemic, the seafood market from Huhanan to Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically closer to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.
With electronic microscopy in transmission, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in ultra-fine sections of human epithelium in the airways.
Human ACE2 has been identified as a receiver of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds to human ACE2 less strongly than SARS-CoV protein, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less infection than SARS-CoV.
The SARS-CoV-2 may also form a new short protein coded by the orf3b as well as a secreted protein coded by the orf8.
The orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 could play a role in viral pathogenesis and inhibit the expression of the NIFβ; however, the orf8 does not contain known areas or functional patterns.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al., presented the Cryo-ME structure of the complete ACE2 to a resolution of 2.9 Å in complex with the transporter of amino acids B0AT1.
They discovered that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was assembled in the form of dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could bind two S proteins, providing indications for the recognition and infection of the coronavirus.
B0AT1 could become a therapeutic target for drug screening to eliminate SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The host of origin and the intermediate host
It was established that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV came from bats and were transmitted to Man via civets and cameloids, respectively.
Following a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, bats were advanced as the native host of SARS-CoV-2, since the new virus is 96% identical to the two SARS coronaviruses from bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host that allowed the virus to cross the species barrier to infect mankind remains unknown, and the route of transmission is still to be clarified.
Ji, et al., submitted the hypothesis that the virus could have been transmitted by snakes to humans, which would imply a homologous recombination within protein S.
According to a study conducted by researchers from Guangzhou, China, pangolin - a long-museum mammal feeding on ants, often used in traditional Chinese medicine - could be the intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 if judged by genetic homology at 99% between a discovered coronary artery in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a 1 per cent gap between two genomes is a significant difference; conclusive results should therefore be expected to establish concrete evidence (Fig. 33).
The physico-chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still very little known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in dry environment and up to 5 days at a temperature of 20 °C and a humidity of 40 to 50%.
SARS-CoV-2 could very well possess similar properties.
It would appear that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet rays as well as to a temperature of 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol at 75%, chlorine-based disinfectants, peracetic acid, chloroform as well as other fatty solvents, but not chlorhexidine, can effectively inactivate the virus.
The human population as a whole is generally immune to SARS-CoV-2 and therefore vulnerable to the new virus.
At present, no detailed studies have been reported regarding the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. (Fig.4).
In general, when a virus infects a host, it is first recognized by the immune system innate by means of molecular pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including type C lectin receptors, Toll type receptors (TLRs), NOD type receptors (NLRs) and RIG-I receptors (RLRs).
By different means, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFN) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, SARS-CoV N protein may allow the virus to escape immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defence.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells that produce specific antibodies to the virus, and CD8+ T cells directly eliminate infected cells.
Help T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to support defence cells.
However, coronavirus may inhibit the functions of T cells by inducing their apoptosis.
Humorary immunity, with supplements such as C3a and C5a as well as antibodies, is also essential to combat viral infection.
For example, isolated antibodies from a restored patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an excessive response from the immune system causes a localized explosion of the number of free radicals, which can result in serious damage to the lungs as well as to other organs and, in the worst scenario, a multivisceral failure or even death.
Infection with SARS-CoV-2, characterized by a home appearance, is more likely to affect elderly people with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is generally accepted that people exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised are more likely to be infected than others.
The mean incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be 1 to 14 days, but more generally than 3 to 7 days after a study of the first 425 cases reported in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period was on average 3 days for a range of 0-24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, concluded an incubation period of 4.8 days (3.0-7.2) according to a population of 8,866 cases.
It is very important for health authorities to adjust the effective duration of quarantine according to the most accurate incubation period possible, in order to prevent infected but asymptomatic people from transmitting the virus.
Generally, people exposed to, or infected with, the virus is quarantined for 14 days.
Should quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the first and main symptom of COVID-19, and may or may not be accompanied by other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients had dyspnoea and/or hypoxaemia one week after the disease occurred.
Regarding severe cases, patients have rapidly developed acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms as well as those with acute fever, even in the absence of chest X-ray abnormalities, should be tested for the virus in order to allow early diagnosis.
A demographic study conducted at the end of December 2019 showed that patients had 98% fever, 76% dry cough, 55% dyspnoea and 3% diarrhoea; 8% of patients needed ventilatory assistance.
Similar findings have been reported in two recent studies on a family and on a home after transmission of the virus from an asymptomatic individual.
Similarly, a demographic study conducted in 2012 showed that the main symptoms of patients with MERS-CoV were fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnoea (55%).
However, 80% required ventilatory assistance, or much more than patients with COVID-19, which is consistent with a higher lethality of MERS compared with COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
Regarding SARS, it was established that the main symptoms were fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnoea (40%-42%), diarrhoea (20%-25%) and throat disease (13%-25%), and ventilatory assistance was required for approximately 14-20% of patients.
As at 14 February, COVID-19 mortality was 2%, for 66,576 confirmed cases worldwide.
Comparably, SARS mortality in November 2002 was 10% for 8,096 confirmed cases.
According to a demographic study conducted in June 2012, the mortality rate was 37% for 2,494 confirmed cases.
A previous study reported that SARS-CoV-2's R0 reached 6.47 with a confidence interval (CI) at 95% of 5.71-7.23, while SARS-CoV's R0 ranged from 2 to 4.
A comparison of the symptoms, mortality and R0 of SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV is presented in Table 1.1.
The above data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater ability to spread than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but less lethal.
Therefore, it is much more difficult to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than it has been for the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemics.
The appearance of a home often occurs within a family or in a gathering or vehicle, as in the case of a cruise.
Patients have often traveled or resided in Wuhan or in other affected areas, or have been in contact with infected people or patients within two weeks prior to the onset of symptoms.
However, it has been shown that individuals may be carriers of the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and that restored patients may be carriers of the virus again, stressing the need to increase the duration of quarantine.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of white peripheral blood cells (including lymphocytes) in the early stages.
For example, lymphopenia with a number of white blood cells < 4 × 109/L and a number of lymphocytes < 1 × 109/L, as well as a high rate of aspartate aminotransferase and viremia were identified in 1,099 patients with VOCID-19.
Some patients had elevated levels of liver enzymes, muscle enzymes and myoglobin in the blood, and most had elevated C-reactive protein levels and erythrocyte sedimentation.
In the most serious cases, the rate of D-Demère, a product of degradation of fibrin present in the blood, was high, and the number of lymphocytes gradually decreased.
Choracic X-ray abnormalities are observed in most patients with VOCID-19, characterized by bilateral unequal shadows or depolated glass opacity at the lung level.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (RASD).
In the case of SDRA, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis seriously impair gas trade.
The dysfunction of type I and type II pneumocytes results in a decrease in the surfactant rate and an increase in surface tension, thus reducing the capacity of the lungs to swell and increasing the risk of pulmonary collapse.
Therefore, the most disturbing thoracic tests often coincide with the most severe form of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of VOCID-19 revealed a breakdown of pneumocytes, the formation of hyalin membranes, interstitial lymphocyte infiltration and the presence of multinucleated syncytial cells in the lungs of a deceased patient of the disease, which coincides with the pathology of viral infection and SDRA and is similar to that of patients with SARS and MERS.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA through a chain reaction by polymerase after reverse transcription (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which can accelerate the epidemic, clinical events began to be used for diagnosis (which was no longer based solely on RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation had been observed for the diagnosis of SARS.
For example, the combination of medical history, clinical events, laboratory tests and radiological tests is essential and imperative for effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol for the use of the SHERLOCK technology based on CRISPR technology for the purposes of detecting SARS-CoV-2, which identifies synthetic RNA fragments of SARS-CoV-2 between 20 × 10-18 mol/L and 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microlitre sample) using a reactive tray in less than one hour without requiring sophisticated equipment.
It is to be hoped that this new technique will significantly improve sensitivity and practicality if its use on clinical specimens is conclusive.
Due to the lack of experience with the new coronavirus, physicians can only provide support care for patients with COVID-19, while testing a variety of therapies that have already been used or proposed for the treatment of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include existing and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma of restored patients, Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
Even the plasma of restored patients has been proposed for treatment purposes.
Pharmaceutical companies are all involved in developing antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs at first and probably also, to a lesser extent, other organs expressing Ace2, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
Nevertheless, respiratory dysfunction and insufficiency are the main threat to patients, and the main cause of death.
Thus, respiratory assistance is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives; this includes general oxygen therapy, high flow oxygen therapy, non-invasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should receive extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (CEMO), a modified cardiopulmonary derivative technique used to treat critical heart or respiratory insufficiency.
In addition, maintaining electrolytic balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and septic shocks, as well as protecting vital organs functions are also essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
Excessive immune response has been established to cause cytokinic shock in patients with SARS and MERS.
Cytokinic shock is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a whole series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNβ and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of SDRA and multivisceral failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokinic shocks, especially in severe cases.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, were used to treat cytokinic shocks.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokinic shocks include modulation of immune response by T-cells, blocking of IFN-Δ, IL-1 and TNF cytokines, inhibition of JAK, blinatumomab, cytokine 4 signal suppressant and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as immunosuppressive agents, have been widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory lesions.
However, high-dose steroids did not have beneficial effects on severe lung lesions in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
Instead, they would cause serious side effects, including an avascular osteonecrosis, thus significantly affecting the prognosis.
However, careful use of short cycles of low-to-moderate corticosteroids has been recommended for patients with severe form of COVID-19.
At the time of writing this report, no effective antiviral therapy has yet been confirmed.
However, the intravenous administration of redesivir, a nucleoside analogue, was effective in a U.S. COVID-19 patient.
Redesivir is a new antiviral drug originally developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, redesivir also demonstrated possible inhibition of other single-brin RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS.
In view of these findings, Gilead forwarded the compound to China to allow a number of trials on individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are highly anticipated.
Furthermore, baricitinib, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been advanced as potential treatments for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver injury and other side effects may occur following combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
Interaction of these treatments with other medicines used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma restored patients and antibody production
Collecting blood from patients who have cured of an infectious disease in order to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from the disease is an ancestral practice.
In fact, restored patients often have a relatively high level of antibodies against the pathogen.
The antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by lymphocytes B to fight pathogens and other foreign bodies; they recognize unique molecules in pathogens and neutralize them directly.
Plasma was thus extracted from the blood of a group of patients who cured of ICDVO-19 and injected into 10 seriously affected patients.
Their symptoms improved in 24 hours, in combination with decreased inflammation, reduced viral load and increased oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification are necessary in order to propose this method for large-scale use until any specific treatment has been developed.
Furthermore, given the therapeutic effects, some plasma-associated drawbacks should be carefully examined.
For example, antibodies can lead to excessive stimulation of immune response and cause potentially fatal cytokines release syndrome.
Antibodies in the blood are generally low, and plasma demand to treat seriously ill patients is important.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to fight a global epidemic.
Therefore, it is more essential and more effective to isolate B cells from restored patients and to identify genetic codes coding the relevant antibodies or to search for effective antibodies against the main proteins of the virus.
This would allow the production of antibodies to increase rapidly.
MTC has been used for thousands of years in China to treat a wide variety of diseases.
However, its effects are largely based on the combination of multiple components in a formula that varies according to the diagnosis, based on TCM theories.
Most effective components remain little or no known as they are difficult to extract and verify, or to know their optimal associations.
Currently, due to the absence of specific effective treatment of COVID-19, the CTA is one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or in remission of a serious form of the disease.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules have proven effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
The best cure rates for COVID-19 were observed in provinces in China that had used the CRM for 87 per cent of their patients, including Gansu Province (63.7 per cent), Ningxia Region (50 per cent) and Hunan (50 per cent), while Hubei Province, which had only used 30 per cent of the patients with COVID-19, had the lowest cure rate (13 per cent).
However, this is a rather approximate comparison since many other impact factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of the disease, must be taken into account for evaluation.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and his collaborators published a study comparing treatment using Western Medicine (OM) only and combined treatment with MO and TCM.
It appeared that the time limit for return to normal body temperature, the time for disappearance of symptoms and the length of hospitalization was significantly shorter for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group only.
Even more impressive, the rate of worsening of symptoms (from mild to severe) was significantly lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group only (7.4% versus 46.2%); likewise, mortality was lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group only (8.8% versus 39%).
Nevertheless, the effectiveness and safety of the CTA remains to be clarified through larger-scale controlled trials and in more centres.
It would also be interesting to characterize the mechanism of action and clarify the effective components of TCM treatments or their associations, if possible.
Individuals identified as probable or confirmed cases of COVID-19 generally feel a deep concern about this highly contagious and deadly disease, and quarantine patients also experience feelings of boredom, loneliness and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatment, such as corticosteroid-induced insomnia, may lead to increased anxiety and psychological distress.
In the early days of the SARS epidemic, multiple psychiatric disorders were reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitation, psychotic symptoms, acute confusion and even suicidal tendencies.
Compulsory contact research and quarantine, as part of the response of public health services to the COVID-19 epidemic, may increase anxiety and lead to some guilt of the patients with regard to the effects of infection, quarantine, and stigmatization of their families and friends.
For example, mental health care should be provided to patients with COVID-19, to individuals identified as probable cases, to people in contact with these populations, and to anyone else in distress.
This psychological support must include the training of multidisciplinary teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, as well as the use of professional electronic applications and equipment to avoid close contact.
Effective vaccines are essential for interrupting the transmission chain of animal tanks and human beings infected with vulnerable hosts, and are often complementary to antiviral treatment in the control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop protein-based S vaccines to produce potent long-term neutralising antibodies and/or to induce protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Attenuated live vaccines have been evaluated on animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these potential vaccines in the elderly and on models subject to lethal provocation and their protection against an infection with a zoonotic virus remains to be determined as no clinical study has yet been initiated.
This is probably due to the fact that SARS went out 17 years ago and that no new cases have been reported since.
On the other hand, cases and sporadic homes of MERS continue to report in the Middle East and other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Various vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using inactivated virus, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-related particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated on animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immunized individuals is an urgent and essential objective for controlling the current epidemic.
However, this is a real challenge due to the important time frame (18 months on average) required to develop a vaccine and dynamic variations of the coronaviruses.
As this is an emerging disease, COVID-19 is just beginning its clinical development through thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients gradually recover without sequelae.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in the most serious cases.
Therefore, developing a forecast model is essential for health agencies to prioritize their services, particularly in areas with limited resources.
Based on clinical studies conducted so far, the factors that may affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients with VOCID-19 are the following (Table 33):
Age: Age was the main factor in predicting SARS, and this also appears to be the case for COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects individuals between 30 and 65 years of age, with 47.7% more than 50 years of age according to a study conducted in 8,866 cases, as described above.
Patients requiring intensive care were more likely to experience underlying comorbidities and complications, and were significantly older (mean age 66 versus 51 years), suggesting age as a prognostic factor for patients with COVID-19.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: patients with COVID-19 requiring intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute heart damage and arrhythmia.
Cardiac events were also the main cause of death in patients with SARS.
It has been established that SARS-CoV-2 may also be related to ACE2 positive cholangiocytes, which may lead to liver dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It should be noted that age and the presence of underlying health problems are strongly correlated and may interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: C-reactive protein (CRP) rate in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue lesions; it has been advanced as a potential predictor of disease, response to treatment and healing.
The correlation between the CRP rate and severity as well as the prognosis of COVID-19 has also been proposed.
In addition, a high rate of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatinine kinase (CK) may also contribute to the development of prognosis.
These enzymes are widely expressed within several organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released in the event of tissue lesions.
They are therefore traditionally markers of cardiac or hepatic dysfunction.
Major clinical symptoms: thoracic X-ray results and temporal progression of clinical symptoms should be examined in combination with other elements for the determination of the prognosis and complications of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants commonly used to treat supplementation for infectious diseases in order to reduce the severity of inflammatory lesions.
Since high-dose corticosteroids were widely used in severe cases of SARS, many survivors had an avascular osteonecrosis resulting in permanent disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, the administration of steroids to patients with VOCID-19 should be limited to a low dose and a short duration.
Mental stress: as described above, the COVID-19 epidemic has resulted in a large number of exceptional stress cases, patients often experiencing long periods of quarantine, extreme uncertainty, and the death of relatives or other patients.
It is imperative to offer psychological support and long-term support to help these individuals overcome this stress and regain a normal life.
Based on demographic studies conducted so far, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics than those of SARS.
In addition to being replicated in the lower airways, SARS-CoV-2 is also effectively replicated in the upper airways and does not cause or little symptoms in the first stage of infection, similar to the coronaviruses from common rums.
Therefore, newly infected individuals or during incubation may produce a large amount of virus during their daily activities, which significantly impedes the control of the epidemic.
However, it was considered that SARS-CoV was transmitted by patients seriously ill, with a very low probability of transmission in the first phase.
The current COVID-19 epidemic is therefore much more serious and difficult to control than was the SARS epidemic.
Considerable efforts are currently being made in China, including the containment of Wuhan and neighbouring cities, as well as the continued quarantine of nearly all of the population to halt the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures had a dramatic impact on the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new cases declined, indicating a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimates suggest that the epidemic will end in March and that the decline phase will last from 3 to 4 months.
However, not all experts share this optimism.
Paul Hunter, et al., believes that COVID-19, which appears to be significantly more infectious than SARS, will not be extinguished in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., developed a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and concluded that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 had been detected in the mean nasal cornnet and re-establishment throat samples, 2 weeks after they left the hospital, indicating that the newly identified virus could become a cyclical episode similar to influenza.
However, encouraging signs have been observed in China with the gradual decline in new cases, suggesting that the strategies implemented would have worked.
According to initial estimates, the Ebola virus was expected to result in up to one million cases and half a million deaths.
However, due to quarantine and strict isolation, the disease was finally placed under control.
As with SARS-CoV, it is possible that SARS-CoV-2 may weaken in terms of infectivity to eventually extinguish or evolve into a less pathogenic virus co-existing with Man.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with that of SARS and MERS is provided below (Fig. (Fig.55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmitted by cough or sneezing, and is also possible by direct contact with contaminated materials.
The virus has also been identified in stools, thus revealing a new possibility of feco-oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 patients revealed that 41% of cases were possibly due to nosocomial infections, with 17 patients with previous diseases and 40 health professionals.
Therefore, precautionary measures should be taken to protect individuals, including health professionals, social workers, relatives and colleagues of the sick, and even any person who may be in contact with infected patients or persons.
The first possible line of defense to reduce the risk of infection lies in the wearing of facial masks; the use of surgical masks and respiratory masks N95 (1860) participates in controlling the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent the projection of potentially infected droplets or their deposition on surfaces, where they may be transmitted to other people.
However, only the masks N95 (1860) provide protection against inhalation of virions from 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of the virions capable of entering fully; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size, since both measure about 85 nm.
Since the particles manage to cross five surgical masks stacked on each other, it is imperative that health professionals in direct contact with patients wear masks N95 (1860s) and not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health professionals must wear adjusted insulation blouses to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect an individual by eye.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor turned out to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 while wearing an N95 mask; the virus might have penetrated its body via the eye due to inflammation.
Therefore, health professionals must also wear transparent visors or protective glasses to the patient's contact.
For populations in affected or potentially affected regions, it is strongly recommended to wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, to stay confined to maximum and to limit contact with potentially infected people.
It is recommended to maintain a distance of one metre with the sick.
These measures are effective means of reducing the risk of infection and preventing the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new human virus, its high degree of homology with SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, must have placed China in high alert condition after the SARS epidemic in 2003.
However, on January 19, 2020, the Director of the Wuhan Disease Control and Prevention Centre reassured the population by saying that the new virus was not contagious, that it had limited interhuman transmissibility and that it would not be difficult to prevent and contain the disease.
This message led to a remarkable release, especially at the time when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical opportunity to contain the disease in Wuhan was missing.
Chinese disease control agencies must learn from it and take appropriate action.
For example, these agencies must (1) be more cautious in their public announcements, because each word counts and can affect the behaviour and decisions of the population; (2) show more sensitivity and responsiveness to unusual clinical data rather than waiting for formal reports from doctors or official agencies; (3) be more restrictive in order to contain a potential epidemic at its beginnings rather than trying to reassure the population; and (4) carry out more targeted and relevant exercises to raise the public's awareness of epidemic diseases, but also to test and improve the society's response system on a regular basis.
The COVID-19 epidemic caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, at the time of writing of this report, it extended to all China as well as to almost 50 other countries around the world.
To the extent that this virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and that the symptoms of COVID-19 are also close to those of SARS, the epidemic of COVID-19 gives rise to an impression of already-vu.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which should be taken into account in order to contain the epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and more men than women; severity and mortality rates are also higher among older people.
SARS has higher mortality than the COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
The transmission of the COVID-19 virus is possible even in the absence of symptoms, while SARS was mostly transmitted by patients with serious illness, so it is much more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19.
This explains in part why SARS-CoV-2 spread much faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
Regular SARS-CoV-2 DNA detection tests may prove negative for some patients with VOCID-19.
On the other hand, restored patients may be positive again to the virus.
This greatly increases the risk of spread.
Despite the rapid progress of research on COVID-19, several critical issues remain outstanding, including:
Where does SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% genetic homology has been established between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-type coronaviruses from bats, this is not sufficient to conclude with certainty that SARS-CoV-2 comes from chiropters.
What is the intermediate species that allowed the transmission of the original host virus, such as bats, to the Man?
Without answers to questions 1 and 2, it is impossible to effectively interrupt transmission, and the epidemic can resume at any time.
Molecular modelling and biochemical analyses have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is related to ACE2, but how does the virus penetrate exactly into the respiratory tract cells and how does it lead to pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to cells expressing the ACE2 of other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is impossible to define a rapid and accurate diagnosis or effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically during interhuman transmission?
Will it evolve as a global pandemic, disappear as the SARS or resurface regularly as the flu?
It is essential, even if it may take time, to get answers to all these questions and many others.
However, no matter what expenses this must induce, we have no choice but to put an end to this epidemic as soon as possible in order to resume the normal course of our existence.
Generally, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than one week, followed by approximately 2 weeks of disease.
Only few immunodepressed patients had severe lower respiratory tract infection.
The first case of SARS dates back to the end of 2002 in Guangdong Province in China.
In addition to the super-transmitters, it was estimated that each case could give rise to approximately two secondary cases with an incubation period between 4 and 7 days, the peak of viral load occurring on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially have myalgia, headache, fever, malaise and chills, followed by dyspnoea, cough and respiratory distress as late symptoms.
Lymphopenia, impaired liver function tests and high kinase creatinine are common abnormalities observed in laboratory tests in case of suspected SARS.
Diffuse alveolar lesions, epithelial cell proliferation and increased macrophages are also observed in patients with SARS.
Approximately 20 to 30% of patients then require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to lower airways, several organs including gastrointestinal pathways, liver and kidney may also be infected in these severe cases, often accompanied by cytokinic shock, which may be fatal in particular in immunodepressed patients.
Since then, huge efforts have been made in HCOV research.
HCOV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
Initially, it was prevalent in young children, elderly people and immunodepressed patients suffering from respiratory disease.
The presence of coryza, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis is common in the disease caused by HCOV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from the nasal sampling of an 8-month-old boy with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it has been identified in the Netherlands, it is actually present worldwide.
HCOV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also called crup.
The same year, HCOV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old male hospitalized due to pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
Like HCOV-NL63, HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 is present worldwide, causing moderate respiratory diseases.
Generally, when these HCOVs acquire the ability to transmit effectively and to maintain themselves continuously in humans, they also become less virulent or pathogenic.
Another secondary epidemic occurred in South Korea in 2015, with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SARS and are characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS have also developed acute renal failure, which is characteristic of MERS in relation to HCOV pathologies.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 confirmed laboratory cases were reported with a high death rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most known human-mortal viruses.
Diarrhoea is also observed in some patients.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but more communicable than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and could contribute to its rapid spread worldwide.
The comparison and opposition of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCOVs revealed very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the incubation period and the duration of HCOV diseases are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCOVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms lies between SARS-CoV and the four community HCOVs (e.g. HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63).
On the other hand, a small subgroup of severe COVID-19 cases is also observed as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Finally, like other HCOVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in saddle samples.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable diffusion after transmission to humans, will influence the ultimate destiny of the current COVID-19 epidemic.
The four community HCOVs that cause moderate symptoms have been well suited to man.
In other words, both could be survivors of previous HCOV pandemics.
For this to happen, HCOVs must replicate in humans in a sufficient proportion to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that compensate for the host's restriction factors.
With this in mind, the more the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic persists and the greater the number of people infected, the more likely the virus is to become completely man-friendly.
If it adapts well, its transmission between men will be difficult to stop by forty or other measures of control of infections.
For many years, the four community-acquired CoVs have been circulating within the population, triggering a simple cold in immunocompetent subjects.
These viruses do not require an animal tank.
On the other hand, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not been well suited to man and their transmission between men is not sustainable.
They must maintain and spread in their zoonotic tanks and seek an opportunity to reach potential human targets, probably through one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
The SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to the SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four HCOV acquired in community.
However, it is more pathogenic than HCOVs acquired in community and less pathogenic than SARS-Cov or MERS-COV.
It remains to be seen whether it will fully adapt to human beings and circulate among them without an animal tank or intermediate host.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCOVs, we will be useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolving, natural hosts, reservoirs, intermediates and HCOV amplifiers.
An animal serves as an evolutionary host of a HCOV if it houses a close ascendant sharing a high homology at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
The original virus has often been well adapted and is not pathogenic to its host.
Similarly, a container host shelters HCOV in a continuous and long-term manner.
On the other hand, HCOVs can also adapt to the intermediate host and even establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural reservoir host.
In particular, given that 80% of Guangzhou's market animals have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibilities that several species of small mammals can also serve as intermediate host amplifiers cannot be excluded.
These bats are positive to anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and to the genetic sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These studies have laid the basis for a new concept that bats are hosts of emerging human pathogens.
The human angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme (ACE2) is known as the SARS-CoV receptor.
Despite a high homology between these two viruses, it is generally estimated that WIV1 is not the immediate parent of SARS-CoV and that bats are not the immediate SARS-CoV tank host.
This is why bats cannot be the MERS-CoV intermediate tank host.
In addition, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromadars were seropositive to specific antibodies neutralizing the MERS-CoV, as well as Middle East camels present in several African countries.
In addition, infected camels secrete the virus not only through the airways, but also through the faecal pathway, which is also the main route of excretion of bats.
We cannot exclude the possibility of pangolin being one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even less important than that between beta-CoV associated with SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 from pangolin.
Recombination is a widespread factor in the evolution of beta-CoV.
Scientists remain divided on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCOVs, zoonotic origins of HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence indicates that HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-229E could both be derived from the bat coV, while HCOV-OC43 and HCOV-HKU1 parent viruses were found in rodents.
On the other hand, HCOV-229E was genetically associated with another coV of bats, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, detected in Ghana, while cameloids were also suspected of being intermediate hosts.
When HCOV-OC43 crossed the species barrier to infect humans from domestic livestock in about 1890, a respiratory infection pandemic was reported.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCOV-229E is less clear.
Alpha-CoV of the bat near HCOV-229E were found.
First of all, unlike alpagas, men can have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
On the other hand, humans have close contact with alpagas.
Then, the alpha-CoV of HCOV-229E-related bats are numerous and non-pathogenic in bats, while the alpha-CoV of alpaga caused an epidemic of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, the alpha-CoV of the alpaga was not found in wild animals.
In fact, bats are the direct source of human pathogens, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not surprising that bats can transmit HCOV-229E directly to humans.
Another possibility, while the alpha-CoV of the bat is used as a genetic reservoir of HCOV-229E, alpagas and dromadaries could be used as intermediate hosts transmitting viruses to humans, exactly as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of the inter-species transmission of bats to dromadaires and dromadaires to humans.
The evolutionary origin of the MERS-CoV found in bats is known thanks to its initial identification and has also been reinforced by subsequent discoveries.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has been present in dromadaires for decades.
It has adapted well in these camels that have passed from intermediate host to stable natural reservoir hosts.
Contrary to the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, if they have one, is different.
In particular, pangolin beta-CoVs are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
Several possibilities for inter-species transmission of SARS-CoV-2 of animals to humans have been included or excluded from future studies.
First, bats could be the reservoir host of a SARS-CoV-2-related virus almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share an ecological niche with bats through scraping or coal mines.
Second, pangolins could be one of the intermediate amplifier hosts to which a SARS-CoV-2-related virus has recently been introduced.
Humans contract the virus through the identification and consumption of game meat.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, may be sensitive to SARS-CoV-2.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred within a third species having been both in contact with bats and pangolins.
Research on the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing.
Compared to other single-brin RNA viruses, estimated CoV mutation rates could be considered "moderate" to "high" with an average substitution rate of ~10-4 substitutions per year per site, depending on the CoV adaptation phase to new hosts.
Nevertheless, CoV mutation rates are approximately one million times higher than those of their hosts.
In addition, the mutation rate is often high when the CoVs are not well suited to the host.
Compared with SARS-CoV, with a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently lower, suggesting a higher rate of human adaptation.
It can be assumed that it has already adapted to another host close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which has been well suited to dromadaires.
In theory, genetic drifting is unlikely to render short-term ineffective vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2.
Third, CoVs change randomly and frequently as a model when replicating the RNA through a unique "choice-copy" mechanism.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination was found for both HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-OC43, as well as for CoVs observed in animals, such as SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
Virus-host interaction in connection with transmission
Beyond these three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with a host receptor is another key factor influencing inter-species transmission.
The recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example here; it also shows positive selection during interspecies transmission episodes.
In other words, these two substitutions of amino acids can be key factors in the adaptation of the virus to man.
It is interesting to note that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receiver as SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S1 protein unit means that the binding affinity of this S protein with human ACE2 may have been altered.
In fact, an electronic cryomicroscopy study indicates an affinity 10 to 20 times greater than that observed between ACE2 and SARS-CoV's S protein.
It will also be interesting to determine whether another co-receptor may be required for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Strangely, HCOV-NL63 also binds to ACE2 but with a different part of S protein.
There are many other HCOV receptors, such as aminopeptidease N for HCOV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated serum acid for HCOV-OC43.
The difference of host proteins between humans and natural HCOV tanks, such as bats, dromadars and rodents, could constitute a barrier to inter-species transmission.
Emergence of new HCOVs: return to the starting box
The diversity of bat coVs offers many emerging opportunities for new HCOVs.
In this sense, bat coVs are HCOV genetic reserves.
Among the accessory proteins of SARS-CoV, ORF8 was considered important in the adaptation to humans, given that SARS-CoV-related bat viruses were isolated, but had divergent ORF8 proteins.
This deletion divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is perceived as an adaptive change that promotes host change.
Recombination sites were also identified in nsp9, in most nsp10 and in some nsp14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the MERS-CoV epidemic has experienced episodes of recombination between different lines, which occurred at dromadaires in Saudi Arabia.
While an ORF4 could be observed in bat and camel viruses associated with HCOV-229E, the alpha-CoV of the alpaga presents a simple insertion of nucleotide, resulting in a disengagement of the reading framework.
Finally, the evolution of new HCOVs is also stimulated by selective pressure exerted in their reservoir hosts.
Asymptomatic cases or moderate symptoms were detected when bats were infected with CoVs, indicating mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
It seemed that the bats had adapted well to the CoV from anatomical and physiological point of view.
For example, anomalies in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology triggered by CoVs.
In addition, the high level of oxygen reactive derivatives (DROs) generated by high metabolic activity of bats could both suppress CoV replication and affect "relight" by exoribonuclease, which would create selective pressure and give rise to highly pathogenic viral strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic CoV strains could also evolve by recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics intended for host adaptation.
Thus, it is not a coincidence that three new HCOVs have appeared over the past two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic or cause moderate symptoms in their host reservoirs such as bats and camels.
They replicate strongly without causing a strong host immune response.
This is where the secrets of the observation of asymptomatic carriers reside and what causes cases of severe human infection.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokinic shock; the stronger the immune response, the more severe the pulmonary lesions.
However, in asymptomatic carriers, immune response was decoupled from CoV replication.
The same strategy for dissociating the immune response could have beneficial effects on treatment against SARS-CoV-2.
For example, the administration of type I interferon at least in the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be beneficial.
In addition, activation of NLRP3 inflammation is defective in bats.
Following this reasoning, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammation with CCM950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
While a 95 per cent nucleotide homology-shared bat-coV beta-coV with SARS-CoV has been discovered, there is also a 96% nucleotide coV with SARS-CoV-2.
Remarkably similar beta-CoV of pangolin to SARS-CoV-2 have been discovered, indicating that pangolin may be one of the intermediate hosts or beta-CoV of pangolin may contribute to genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
The CoVs returned under the ramp fire due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has been in the dromadaire for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the premises.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as has been done on wildlife markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop the recurrent outbreaks of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV in camels, associated with other infection control measures.
Since we are unable to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic CoVs circulate in nature.
In particular, bat coVs, whose zoonotic potential is very high.
The cultivation of wildlife consumption in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In fact, many viruses have been on the planet for a long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until there is an opportunity for contagion.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of the CoVs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of the animal to man and future epidemics.
In conclusion, the most effective way for man to prevent viral zoonoses is to stay away from the ecological niches of natural zoonoses.
First, if bats transmit a parent virus of SARS-CoV-2 to pangolins, it would be interesting to observe the circumstances in which bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, it is necessary to determine how humans come into contact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal plays the role of a real intermediate host, it remains to be clarified how it interacts with different species, including men, bats and pangolins.
Whether it is a bat, pangolin or other mammal, the SARS-CoV-2 or almost identical parent viruses observed in their natural hosts should be identified.
Respiratory diseases such as flu or cold can be contracted, for example, by failing to wash your hands before touching your eyes, nose or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes).
The primary medical objective of hand washing is to eliminate pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms likely to cause disease) and chemicals, which may be harmful or cause disease.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
as well as the reduction in infant mortality rates during childbirth at home.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory diseases and diarrhoea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioural changes, such as washing of hands to soap.
Pneumonia, one of the main IRAs, is the first cause of mortality among children under five years of age, which makes nearly 1.8 million victims a year.
Together, diarrhea and pneumonia cause almost 3.5 million children to die each year.
Handwashing also protects against impetigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
Minor deleterious effect, frequent handwashing may damage the skin by causing skin dryness.
A 2012 Danish study revealed that excessive handwashing could result in eczema or dermatitis at the hand level, characterized by squamous skin and itching, and particularly common among health workers.
Too frequent hand washing is also considered as one of the symptoms of compulsive obsessional disorder (OCD).
The decay twice a year, associated with the daily washing of the hands with soap and the daily brushing of the teeth with a fluorinated toothpaste, is at the heart of this national program.
It was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce obstacles to the solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is not an effective cleaner for the skin since lipids and proteins, which are organic matter of the soil, are difficult to soluble in the water.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, may contain bacteria from previous uses.
To date, there is no evidence suggesting that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants can target organisms resistant to antibiotics in nature.
Therefore, even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not the result of antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as announced.
In addition to the surfactant and skin-protective agent, the most complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) used to regulate pH, benzoic acid, having an antimicrobial function, and other protective agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).A rigorous analysis of the University of Oregon's Public Health School indicated that ordinary soaps were as effective as antibacterial soaps intended for individuals and containing triclosan, to prevent disease and eliminate bacteria from hands.
The hot water used to wash your hands is not hot enough to kill the bacteria.
Bacteria increase much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, warm and soapy water is more effective than cold and soapy water to eliminate natural oils with dirt and bacteria.
But contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that the use of warm water did not contribute to reducing the microbial burden on the hands.
A disinfectant or an antiseptic for hands is a non-aqueous hand hygiene product.
Most are formulated based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol associated with a thickening agent such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) to obtain a gel, or a moisturizer such as glycerin to obtain a liquid or foam for greater ease of use and reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide strengthens antimicrobial activity and disinfectants for hands containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol effectively eliminate germs.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions kill bacteria, multi-resistant bacteria (SARM and ERV), tuberculosis and certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, VRS, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis), as well as fungi.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions are almost completely ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, the main cause of contagious gastroenteritis.A sufficient amount of disinfectant for hands or hydro-alcoholic solution must be used to properly wet or cover both hands.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and their rapid disposal of microorganisms; however, they must not replace a handwashing appropriate unless you have water and soap at hand.
Frequent use of hydroalcoholic solutions may result in skin drying if the formula is not reinforced by emollients and/or skin moisturizing agents.
The drying effect of alcohol may be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
As part of clinical trials, hydroalcoholic solutions containing emollients have caused significantly less irritation and skin dryness than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact hive or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in hydro-alcoholic solutions are rare.
Despite their effectiveness, non-aqueous products do not remove the organic materials on their hands, but only disinfect them.
That is why hand disinfectants are not as effective as soap and water to avoid the spread of many pathogens, since they remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of disinfectants for non-alcoholic hands depends heavily on the ingredients and formula, and has always been significantly lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based disinfectants.
More recently, formulas using benzalkonium chloride have presented a sustainable and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose efficacy is reduced after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
Ash or soil can be more effective than water alone, but less than soap.
What is more, if the soil or ash is contaminated by microorganisms, it may increase the spread of disease instead of curbing it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant because, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap when it is not available.
Wet your hands with warm or cold running water.
Current water is recommended due to the risk of contamination of stagnant water points, while water temperature does not appear to make any difference).
Place a generous amount of soap on your hands by rubbing them against each other, not forgetting the back of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails.
Soap eliminates skin germs, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than using water alone.
Fret for at least 20 seconds.
The friction action creates friction, which helps eliminate the skin germs, and the longer friction removes more germs.
Rinse thoroughly with running water.
Rinsing in a stagnant watershed can lead to recontamination of hands.
Dry with a clean or outdoor towel.
Wet and wet hands come back more easily.The most often forgotten areas are the thumb, wrist, spaces between the fingers and under the nails.
Artificial nails and scaled nail polish can house microorganisms.
A moisturizing lotion is often recommended to avoid having dry hands; skin dryness promotes the emergence of skin lesions that may increase the risk of transmission of infections.
There are many economic alternatives to washing hands when tap water and/or soap are not available. For example, water flow from a slurry or tart suspended and pierced and/or used ash if needed in developing countries.In situations where water supply is limited (such as in schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as "typey-taps" and other economic options.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a crutch suspended using a rope, and a pedal allowing you to pour a small amount of water on your hands and a soap bread.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to dry hands in public toilets is to debate.
More and more research suggests that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric hand dryers than are often found in toilets.
After washing and drying hands in hot air dryers, it was found that the total number of bacteria increased by an average of 194% on the pulp of fingers and 254% on the palms.
Drying in air jet hands resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the 42% pulp of fingers and on the 15% palms.
After hand drying, the following variations in bacterial number were observed:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and the hand dryers have been compared to drying using paper towels.
Washing hands with disinfectant sheets is an alternative solution during travel, in the absence of soap and water.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions must contain at least 60% alcohol.
There are electronic devices that emit reminders when hospital staff forget to wash their hands.
Medical hand washing must last at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or gel to make each part of the hands moist and rub.
Hands must be rubbed against each other by crossing between fingers.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the tap (and open the exit door if applicable).
The aim of hand washing in health structures is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and to avoid transmission.
A relevant analysis was conducted by Whitby et al.
after exposure to blood/biological fluid;
before an aseptic gesture; and
All jewels must be removed.
In this procedure, it is necessary to wash your hands and arms up to the elbow, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
When rinsing, water on the forearms should not flow to the hands.
In order to reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for your hands before and after taking care of a sick person.
Regarding the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of hand washing were obtained during the first 20 per cent of washing, and that there was only very little additional benefit to increase the hand washing frequency beyond 35%.
Further research is needed to find out which interventions are most effective in different health structures.
For example, in most rural Africa, it is rare to find taps to wash your hands close to private or public toilets, despite the existence of economic options to build hand washing stations.
However, low hand washing rates may also be due to tenacious habits, rather than lack of soap or water.
Once minimum standards are reached, schools can move from one to three final stars.
The construction of hand-washing stations can be part of the promotion campaigns of hand hygiene that are carried out to reduce diseases and infant mortality.
The World Day of Handwashing is another example of an awareness campaign that claims to promote behavioural evolution.Following the 2019-2020 Coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF encouraged the adoption of an emoji that illustrates handwashing.
However, a review suggests that the promotion of washing hands with soap is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
At that time, most people still believed that infections were due to the fetidal smells called miasmes.
In Germany, for example, posters illustrating "good hand washing techniques" were placed next to sinks in public toilets and in office buildings and airports.
The term "washing hands" refers to a person's refusal to assume responsibility or to be complicit in something.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after having had such thoughts are less inclined to engage in other compensatory "purification" measures, such as volunteering.
Similarly, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam demand to wash their hands before and after each meal.

'Cause it's the flu season
It should also be noted that artificial selection can contribute to involuntary changes in virus genomes, which are most likely to follow the pressure exerted in the selection, especially by the host's immune system.
For example, complete ORF4 loss can be mentioned in the HCOV-229E prototype strain due to a two nucleotide deletion.
While an ORF4 could be observed in bat and camel viruses associated with HCOV-229E, the alpha-CoV of the alpaga presents a simple insertion of nucleotide, resulting in a disengagement of the reading framework.
Finally, the evolution of new HCOVs is also stimulated by selective pressure exerted in their reservoir hosts.
Asymptomatic cases or moderate symptoms were detected when bats were infected with CoVs, indicating mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
It seemed that the bats had adapted well to the CoV from anatomical and physiological point of view.
For example, anomalies in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology triggered by CoVs.
In addition, the activity of natural kill cells in bats is eliminated by positive regulation of the receptor inhibiting natural kill cells NKG2/CD94 and by the low expression rate of the molecules of the major class I histocompatibility complex.
In addition, the high level of oxygen reactive derivatives (DROs) generated by high metabolic activity of bats could both suppress CoV replication and affect "relight" by exoribonuclease, which would create selective pressure and give rise to highly pathogenic viral strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic CoV strains could also evolve by recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics intended for host adaptation.
Thus, it is not a coincidence that three new HCOVs have appeared over the past two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic or cause moderate symptoms in their host reservoirs such as bats and camels.
They replicate strongly without causing a strong host immune response.
This is where the secrets of the observation of asymptomatic carriers reside and what causes cases of severe human infection.

However, in asymptomatic carriers, immune response was decoupled from CoV replication.
The same strategy for dissociating the immune response could have beneficial effects on treatment against SARS-CoV-2.
The response to interferon is particularly strong in bats.
For example, the administration of type I interferon at least in the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be beneficial.
In addition, activation of NLRP3 inflammation is defective in bats.
Following this reasoning, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammation with CCM950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2 appeared following the general scheme whereby SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV emerged.
While a 95 per cent nucleotide homology-shared bat-coV beta-coV with SARS-CoV has been discovered, there is also a 96% nucleotide coV with SARS-CoV-2.
While civets and other animals present on the markets were discovered as carriers of viruses identical to SARS-CoV, no immediate intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 was identified.
Remarkably similar beta-CoV of pangolin to SARS-CoV-2 have been discovered, indicating that pangolin may be one of the intermediate hosts or beta-CoV of pangolin may contribute to genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
While questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was designed by man, whether voluntarily or accidentally.
The CoVs returned under the ramp fire due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
The study of VCs in bats and other animals has greatly altered our perception of the role played by zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs in the transmission of VCHs to humans.
A lot of factual data have shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 come from bats and are transmitted to man by intermediate hosts.
Since the SARS-CoV infection stems from contact between humans and civettes present in markets, the closure of fresh product markets and the slaughter of civets found there could have effectively ended the SARS epidemic.
Following the same reasoning, pangolins should be withdrawn from fresh product markets to avoid zoonoses transmission, given the discovery of many beta-CoV lines of pangolins closely related to SARS-CoV-2
However, the question of whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans by pangolins and other mammals and, where appropriate, how such transmission occurs, will remain to be determined in the following studies.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has been in the dromadaire for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the premises.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as has been done on wildlife markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop the recurrent outbreaks of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV in camels, associated with other infection control measures.
Since we are unable to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic CoVs circulate in nature.
In particular, bat coVs, whose zoonotic potential is very high.
The opportunities are not lacking for these zoonotic CoVs to evolve and recombine, causing the emergence of new more communicable and/or mortal CoVs in man in the future.
The cultivation of wildlife consumption in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In the face of the devastation caused by SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparedness and response plan should be put in place.
In fact, many viruses have been on the planet for a long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until there is an opportunity for contagion.
Although bats have many characteristics favourable to the spread of viruses, man's probability of being in contact with bats and other wild species can be minimized if people are aware of the need to stay away.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of the CoVs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of the animal to man and future epidemics.
In conclusion, the most effective way for man to prevent viral zoonoses is to stay away from the ecological niches of natural zoonoses.
Not all the secrets of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 are yet known.
First, if bats transmit a parent virus of SARS-CoV-2 to pangolins, it would be interesting to observe the circumstances in which bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, it is necessary to determine how humans come into contact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal plays the role of a real intermediate host, it remains to be clarified how it interacts with different species, including men, bats and pangolins.
Finally, given that many mammals, including domestic animals, are likely to contract SARS-CoV-2, both experimental monitoring and contamination is necessary.
Whether it is a bat, pangolin or other mammal, the SARS-CoV-2 or almost identical parent viruses observed in their natural hosts should be identified.
Future research in this area will help to clarify the evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals and will have a significant impact on the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Update of the diagnostic criteria for "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" of COVID-19 is required
On February 6, 2020, our team issued a Quick Recommendation Directive for the Diagnostic and Treatment of New Coronavirus Infection 2019 (2019-nCoV) and this directive described our experience and provided references to address this pandemic worldwide.
However, the 2019 coronary disease (COVID-19) is recent, and our knowledge and knowledge progress gradually on the basis of the results of the ongoing studies and experience of clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment on our guidelines and provided the most recent diagnostic criteria for a "suspected case" and a "confirmed case" according to the latest guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of the COVID-19 (seventh version) published by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused an epidemic that now officially bears the name of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus was called severe acute coronarovirus 2 respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO qualified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick recommendation that was posted online on Military Medical Research on February 06, 2020.
She has attracted much attention since her publication.
Please note, however, that COVID-19 is a new disease, our knowledge and knowledge are slowly progressing on the basis of the results of the ongoing studies and the experience of clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
For example, the COVID-19 diagnostic and treatment directives published by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) have been published in seven total editions between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, some of which have been substantially modified.
Having received a comment from Zhou et al., our directive presented a simple evaluation proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their work has provided further evidence for our directive and is also a valuable reference for this global pandemic.
We approve of their important work and thank them.
However, their work must also be updated according to the latest COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines (Seventh Version) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), confirmation of a suspected case must involve one of the characteristics of epidemiological history with two clinical manifestations to constitute a complete analysis, or must correspond to three clinical manifestations in the absence of clear epidemiological history:
epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and in neighbouring areas or other communities where cases of VOCID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) a history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive test of nucleic acids); (3) a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in the city of Wuhan or neighbouring areas or other communities where cases of VOCID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (4) a history of contact with confirmed case clusters (≥ 2 cases with fever and/or respiratory symptoms occurring in a restricted area such as home, office, school class, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) imaging with characteristics of a COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell count indicating normal, decreased or reduced lymphocyte count from the onset of symptoms.
The confirmed case diagnosis shall be based on the suspected case with any of the following pathological or serological evidence: (1) positive real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) severe homogeneity of the entire viral genome with known new coronaries; (3) positive serological test for IgM and IgG antibodies of SARS-CoV-2; or modification of the specific IgG antibody of SARS-CoV-2 from negative to positive or increased title ≥ 4 times in the recovery phase compared to that of the acute phase.
We can see that the real-time PCR test of nucleic acids in the airways or blood samples was added in the second edition (18 January 2020) and in the third edition (22 January 2020).
Pathogenic blood sampling was added to the fourth edition (January 27, 2020) and to the fifth edition (8 February 2020); then serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These changes are based on the continuous work of researchers to find an optimal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis, as well as samples of airways including blood sampling, with increased availability of different specimens, and contributed to the addition of the positive result of the specific antibody in the confirmed criteria.
In addition, more and more evidence reminds us of the caution with regard to atypical symptomatic patients and asymptomatic patients.
Therefore, the graphic representation of Zhou et al. should be updated as they classified people who did not have clinical symptoms as "low-risk".
The evaluation system should also be verified in clinical practice and in future studies.
In conclusion, we hope for more direct evidence and ask readers to forward their comments.
With regard to the diagnosis of "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases", we suggest that they follow and comply with the most recent guidelines in their country.
Our team will also update our directive in time to provide its assistance.
Bangladesh announces five new COVID-19 deaths, a daily record
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new COVID-19 deaths in one day.
The country thus records a single day mortality record due to the virus.
Yesterday, the Bangladeshi Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Monitoring and Research (EDDCR) indicated that the number of infected persons registered included 114 active cases and 33 cured persons, who remained confined at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
The closure of public transport began on 26 March and was due to end on Saturday, 4 April.
The transport of essential goods (medical supplies, fuel and food) was always permitted.
On March 19, these three people had already recovered.
On Thursday, the total number of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infections exceeded millions worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
Countries around the world have announced more stringent measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, Moscow's mayor, extended the city's containment until May 1.
The Parliament of Portugal voted for the extension of the state of national emergency of 15 days; the vote was adopted with 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions and one vote against.
Zoonotic origins of human coronavirus
Epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (RAS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) reversed the tendency to reveal how devastating and potentially deadly an infection with HCOV could be.
Most HCOVs come from bats in which they are not pathogens.
The intermediate reservoir hosts of some HCOVs are also known.
The identification of host animals has direct implications for the prevention of human diseases.
The study of host CoV interactions in animals may also help to better understand the CoV in humans.
Depending on the differences in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genres (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV). The beta-CoV genus contains the majority of HCOVs and is divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents play the genetic source role for the majority of alpha-CoV and beta-CoV, while birds are the main reservoir of gamma-CoV and delta-CoV.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCOVs) are known.
Among them, HCOV-229E and HCOV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
The other five beta-CoV include HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
The tracing of the zoonotic origins of HCOV provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving forces and restrictive factors of the crossing of the species barrier.
It can also guide or facilitate the search for the reservoir, intermediate and amplifier of SARS-CoV-2, with important implications for the prevention of future infections.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Seven HCOVs have been identified in recent decades.
The first strain of HCOV-229E was isolated in the airways of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966 and then adapted to grow in pulmonary cell lines WI-38.
Patients infected with HCOV-229E had symptoms of classical cold, including headaches, sneezing, malaises and sore throats, with fever and cough observed in 10-20% of cases.
HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43 are both present around the world and appear to be transmitting mainly in winter in temperate climate countries.
Stores in Australia reduce the amount of toilet paper per purchase
On Sunday and Saturday evening, the Australian stores chains Woolworths and Coles reduced their restrictions on the purchase of two toilet paper and one package per purchase in all stores nationally, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also introduced a package limit.
These limits have been displayed in the form of messages to the boxes and on the Facebook pages of the channels.
The buyers apparently had reservations due to fear of COVID-19 and the need to limit themselves.
Wednesday, Woolworths also restricted the purchases of toilet paper for home deliveries to one package per order.
These measures followed the previous restriction of four packages per purchase introduced by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March, respectively.
Coles, in his press release of March 8, stated that with the restriction of four packages in force, "many stores are still in stock breakage within the hour of delivery," and qualified the "unprecedented" request, while ALDI, in a Facebook publication on Tuesday, called it "unexpected".
Sales had a "strong increase" last week, according to a spokesperson from Woolworths.
The Costco store in Canberra also restricted the authorized quantity to two packages last week.
In order to further reduce the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased the frequency of delivery, Woolworths ordered an additional stock, while ALDI made stocks available earlier for a planned Wednesday promotion.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers' Association, said that retailers are trying to increase stocks, but the local council's restrictions on truck deliveries make the task difficult.
It foresees an increase in production costs, while suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that following the early release of stocks, some stores are unable to honour Wednesday's promotion.
In an article published on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, an expert in the distribution sector of the University of Technology of Queensland, explained that stores replenish stocks every night.
He noted that the toilet paper is a bulky item, resulting in stocks of a reduced amount that, once exhausted, leave large spaces empty in rays, strengthening the impression of a shortage.
"Coles and Woolworths consider [that] if the rays are full, if products such as toilet paper rolls and disinfectants can be [buyed] and are available in large quantities, this will probably reduce panic," Russell Zimmerman explained to ABC News.
The manufacturer of recycled toilet paper Who Gives has Crap declared last Wednesday that they were in stock rupture.
Kimberly-Clark, who manufactures Kleinex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper who manufactures Sorbent paper, stressed that they work 24/7 to maintain supply, according to News.com.au's article.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that some real estate sellers offered free toilet paper to the first buyer during auctions in Melbourne, while fewer auction sales were organized because the buyers were on vacation during the long weekend of the Labor Day.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a daily printed newspaper in Darwin, included an eight-page package designed to be cut out and used as toilet paper.
The stores were initially reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a March 3 report by ABC Australia in which they announced that they did not plan to introduce purchase restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products also had a high demand, including masks, disinfectants, dry products, hygiene products for hands and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, it was observed Sunday night that the British online supermarket Ocado limited the purchases of toilet paper Andres to two packs of 12 rolls.
World Health Organization qualifies COVID-19 as pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) described the current COVID-19 epidemic (the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2) coronary artery disease.
Although the word "pandemic" refers only to the degree of spread of the disease, rather than to the danger of specific cases, WHO indicated the need to push governments into action:
"All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries detect, test, treat, isolate, locate and mobilize their populations in the context of the response," said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the Director General of WHO.
"We are deeply concerned not only about the alarming levels of spread and gravity but also about the alarming levels of inaction."
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is "unprecedented".
He stated, in statements published by CNN in February, that "other than influenza, no other respiratory virus has been observed since its appearance until its continued spread worldwide."
Gebreyus expressed a similar opinion, stating that "we have never witnessed a pandemic caused by a coronavirus."
What he added: "and we have never witnessed a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time."
The new pandemic status follows the WHO decision in January to declare the epidemic an international public health emergency.
The director of the U.S. National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said about the epidemic: "To make short, the situation will get worse."
On Thursday, Associated Press announced that there were at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, leading to more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 Coronavirus pandemic is an epidemic of ongoing coronary artery disease since 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The epidemic was detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared an international public health emergency on January 30, 2020 and recognized as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As at 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 cases were reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
Nearly 364,000 people are cured.
The lethality rate is estimated at 4 per cent in China, while in the rest of the world it varies from 13.04 per cent in Algeria to 0.08 per cent in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Complications may include acute respiratory distress syndrome and pneumonia.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it may vary between two and fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include hand washing, mouth covering to cough, staying away from other people, and monitoring and restraining suspected people from being infected.
The authorities of the world reacted by introducing restrictions on travel, quarantine, fire cover, risk controls at workplaces and closures.
The pandemic has caused serious socio-economic disturbances worldwide, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, as well as widespread shortages aggravated by panic purchases.
Schools and universities have closed nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4 per cent of the world's student population.
False information on the virus has circulated on the Internet, and incidents of xenophobia and discrimination have occurred against Chinese, other people of origin and of Asian appearance in the East and South-East, as well as others from regions with numerous cases of the virus.
Due to the decrease in travel and closures in the heavy industry, there has been a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei province) reported a home of unknown cause pneumonia on 31 December 2019, and an investigation was opened early January 2020.
Most cases were linked to the ocean fruit wholesale market in Huanan and it is therefore thought that the virus would be of zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the epidemic is called SARS-CoV-2, a recently discovered and closely related virus to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV. Subsequently, it was discovered that the first known person who presented symptoms had become ill on December 1, 2019, and that person had no obvious link to the subsequent home of the fresh products market.
In the case of the first home reported in December 2019, the two thirds showed a link to the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post suggested that the first case could go back to November 17, 2019, among a 55-year-old person from the Province of Hubei. On February 26, 2020, WHO reported that, as the new cases appeared to decline in China but suddenly increase in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There could be a high underestimation of cases, especially among those with benign symptoms.
On 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported among young people, 19 years of age and less than 2.4 per cent of cases worldwide. United Kingdom Chief Scientific Adviser Patrick Vallance estimated that 60 per cent of the British population should be infected before reaching effective collective immunity.
The cases refer to the number of persons tested at COVID-19, and the test was confirmed positive according to the official protocols.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries had for official policies not to test those who had only benign symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March revealed that up to 23 January China estimated 86% of undetected COVID-19 infections and that these unregistered infections were the source of infection of 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy was much higher than the reported cases.
The first estimates of the basic reproduction rate (R0) of COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 heal.
For those who do not heal, the period between the onset of symptoms and death is between 6 and 41 days, the most common being 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths had been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as at 5 February, about 80 per cent of deaths were over 60 years of age, and 75% suffered from pre-existing health problems such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official accounts of deaths related to the COVID-19 pandemic generally refer to deceased persons who have been tested positive to COVID according to official protocols.
The number of actual COVID-19 victims could be much higher, since it might not include untested deceased persons - e.g. at home, in retirement homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy show that the numbers of overmortality during the pandemic are 4-5 times higher than the official count of COVID deaths.
A spokesperson of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CCD) acknowledged "We know that [the number of deaths announced] is underestimated", a statement confirmed by anecdotal reports of the under-assessment in the United States. Such underestimation often occurs in pandemics, such as the H1N1 outbreak of swine flu in 2009. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on 14 February.
On 28 February, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths per country had been recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
On 13 March, more than forty countries and territories reported deaths on all continents except Antarctica. Several indicators are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These figures vary according to regions and over time, and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, the therapeutic options, the time elapsed since the beginning of the epidemic, as well as demographic characteristics such as age, sex, and especially health. The case-death report represents the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed over a given period.
According to Johns-Hopkins University statistics, the global case-death report is 6.0% (97 039/1 617 204) as at 10 April 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, case-death estimates decreased by 17.3% (for symptoms occurring between 1 and 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for symptoms occurring after 1 February 2020). The other indicators are the lethality rate (letality rates), which represents the percentage of persons diagnosed who suffer from illness, and the infection rate (infection rates), which represents the percentage of contaminants (diagnosised and undiagnosed) who suffer from disease.
These statistics are not limited over time and follow a specific population of contamination at the end of the disease.
Several scientists have tried to calculate these figures for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine of Oxford University estimates that the infection rate for the pandemic as a whole is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The highest value of this range is consistent with the results of the first randomised tests for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study analysing the impact of tests on lethality rate estimates.
WHO maintains that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and final duration of the epidemic are uncertain and may vary by region.
Maciej Boni of the State University of Pennsylvania stated: "Without control, infectious epidemics generally stabilize and then start to return when the disease has just missed available hosts.
But it is almost impossible to make relevant forecasts at the moment when this will happen."
The Chief Medical Adviser of the Chinese Government Zhong Nanshan stated that "it could be completed by June" if all countries succeed in mobilizing to follow WHO recommendations on measures to prevent the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine declared that SARS-CoV-2 "will continue to circulate, potentially for a year or two."
According to an Imperial College study conducted by Neil Ferguson, physical distance and other measures will be necessary "until a vaccine is available (in possibly 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said: "I think it is unlikely that this coronavirus—because it is very easily transmitted—would disappear altogether" and that it could "be transformed into seasonal disease, likely to reappear every year."
The virulence of this return would depend on collective immunity and the extent of the mutation.
Symptoms of COVID-19 are sometimes quite non-specific and infected people may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Common symptoms include fatigue, production of respiratory secretions (mucosities), loss of smell, fainting, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headaches, chills, vomiting, haemoptysis, diarrhoea, or cyanosis. WHO claims that approximately one in six person is seriously ill and has respiratory difficulties.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CCD) identify emergency symptoms such as respiratory difficulty, persistent pain or chest pressure, sudden confusion, difficult awakenings, and face or bluetongue; immediate medical care is recommended if these symptoms are present. The subsequent development of the disease may result in severe pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, septicaemia, septic shock and death.
Some of the infected individuals may be asymptomatic, without any clinical symptoms but with test results that confirm the infection, then researchers issued recommendations that those who had close contact with confirmed infected individuals should be closely monitored and examined to avoid the risk of infection.
Chinese asymptomatic ratio assessments range from a few to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the period between contamination and onset of symptoms) varies between one and 14 days; it is more often than five days. Good example of uncertainty, the estimate of the proportion of people with COVID-19 who lost the smell was initially 30% before falling to 15%.
Some information on how the disease spreads remains to be determined.
The disease is supposed to be transmitted mainly during close contact and by fine droplets produced by coughing, sneezing, or talking; this close contact corresponds to a radius of 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have shown that unprotected coughing can project droplets at a distance of 4.5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 metres (27 feet).
Some suggested that the virus could also be transmitted by droplets that would remain in the air over longer periods, which could be projected by talking. Respiratory droplets can also be projected during expiration, including by talking, although the virus is generally not airported.
Postillons may land in the mouth or nose of other people next door or even be inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (PRC) may cause respiratory secretions that are sprayed and thus lead to air propagation.
It can also spread when someone touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, before touching his eyes, nose, or mouth.
If some fear that it may be transmitted through the saddles, this risk is considered to be low.
The government of China has excluded the possibility of a feco-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, however the spread may be possible before symptoms appear and at advanced stages of the disease.
People were tested positive for the disease up to three days before symptoms suggested that transmission is possible prior to the development of significant symptoms.
Only a few confirmed asymptomatic case reports in the laboratory exist, but asymptomatic transmission has been detected by some countries during contact research.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that if it is not yet known exactly how easy the disease is spreading, a person in general contaminates two to three others. The virus survives hours or even days on the surface.
Precisely, the virus was detected at the end of three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel 304, after one day on cardboard, and at the end of four hours on copper.
This, however, depends on humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals were tested positive at the COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, but the British authorities recommend that they wash their hands after touching animals, as if they had been in contact with other areas that could have been affected by infected persons.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, initially isolated from three people with pneumonia related to Wuhan's acute respiratory disease home.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus exist in the related coronaviruses in nature. Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. The SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
We think it would be zoonotic.
A genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus belongs genetically to the genus Betacronavirus, to the subgenre Sarbecovirus (line B) associated with two strains from the bats.
It is the same as 96% of all genomes of another mouse-chave coronavirus sample (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one amino acid of difference in certain parts of the genome sequences between pangolin and human viruses.
The overall genome comparison has shown to date a maximum of 92% of common genetic material between pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that pangolins are the intermediate host.
Virus infection may be provisionally diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, but the final confirmation is made by reverse transcription of the polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or scanner.
A study comparing the PCR and scanning at Wuhan suggested that the scanner is significantly more sensitive than the PCR, although less precise, because many of its imaging features coincide with other pneumonias and pathological processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "the scanner be not used to detect or as a first-intention test to diagnose COVID-19".
WHO published several RNA test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, with a first issue on January 17.
The test uses the reverse transcription of the polymerase chain reaction in real time (rRT-PCR).
The test can be performed on respiratory or blood samples.
The results are generally available in a few hours or days.
This test is usually performed on a rhinopharynx sample but can also be used as a throat sample. Several laboratories and companies are currently developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
On 6 April 2020, none of them proved reliable enough to be approved for general use.
In the United States, a serological test developed by Cellex was approved for emergency use by certified laboratories only.
The characteristic imaging elements on X-rays and tomodensitometry (scanner) of persons with symptoms include asymmetrical peripheral depolated glass opacitys and a lack of pleural outflow.
The Italian Society of Radiology is currently an on-line database of confirmed case imaging results.
Due to co-reupling with other infections such as adenovirus, unconfirmed PCR imaging is a limited precision to detect COVID-19.
An important study in China compared the results of thoracic scanners to the PCR and demonstrated that if imaging is less accurate for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, advocating it as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
Convolutive networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to detect characteristics of the virus in the imaging both on X-rays and scanners.
Preventive strategies for the transmission of the disease include overall having good personal hygiene, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing into a handkerchief and then throwing the handkerchief directly into a trash bag.
Those who had already been contaminated were recommended to wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distancing measures have also been recommended to prevent transmission. Many governments have prohibited or advised all non-essential movements to or from countries and sectors affected by the epidemic.
Nevertheless, the virus has reached the stage of community transmission in large areas of the planet.
This means that the virus spreads in communities, and some members of these communities do not know where or how they have been contaminated. Health professionals who care for someone who may be infected are advised to take usual precautions and contact precautions and wear protective glasses. The search for contacts is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and prevent future transmissions.
The use of mobile phone location data by Governments in this regard has raised confidentiality issues, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations publishing a communiqué calling for limitations on this type of surveillance.
Several mobile applications were launched or proposed on the basis of volunteering, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record a user's presence near other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they have been in close contact with someone who has been tested positive to the COVID-19. False ideas are currently circulating on how to prevent infection; for example, brushing their nose and scratching with mouth bath is not effective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19, but many organizations are currently working to develop one.
It is recommended to wash your hands to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands often in soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after they have been in the toilet or when their hands are visibly clean; before eating; and after having been soaked, coughed, or sneezed.
It's because outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which breaks its protective envelope.
The CDC also recommended using a disinfectant for alcohol-based hands containing a volume of at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not readily available.
WHO advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces may be decontaminated in several ways (in one minute exposure to disinfectant for a stainless steel surface), including ethanol at 62–71 %, isopropanol at 50–100 %, sodium hypochlorite at 0.1 %, hydrogen peroxide at 0.5 %, and iodine povidone at 0.2–7.5%.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a case of COVID is suspected or confirmed in an establishment as an office building or a nursery, all parts such as offices, toilets, common rooms, as well as common electronic equipment such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls, and automatic distributors used by the sick, be disinfected.
Health organizations advise people to cover their mouths and noses with their folded elbow or a handkerchief when they cough or sneez, and to throw away any handkerchief immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who would be infected, as wearing a mask can limit the volume and distance passed by the projected posts by speaking, sneezing, and coughing.
WHO issued instructions that explain where and when to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Putting a mask can reduce people's propensity to touch their face, which is an important source of infection in the absence of good hygiene of their hands."The use of masks has also been recommended to those taking care of a person potentially affected by the disease.
WHO recommended wearing masks to healthy people only if they face an important risk, for example if they deal with a patient with COVID-19, even though it recognized that wearing the mask can help people not touch their face.
Several countries have begun to encourage their people to wear masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends the wearing of non-medical masks in fabric. China has specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks to healthy people, especially in the event of proximity (1 metre (3 ft) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask in public transport or crowded locations.
In Thailand, health authorities encourage people to make facial masks at home and clean them every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia prohibited public exits without a mask or other means of covering their nose and mouth.
On 16 March, Vietnam imposed the wearing of the mask on everyone in public places, so that everyone could protect himself and protect others.
The Austrian government has ordered that everyone entering a supermarket wears a mask.
Israel asked all its residents to wear a mask in public.
Taiwan, which produced ten million masks per day since mid-March, imposed the wearing of the mask on passengers of trains and long buses on April 1.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear a mask for any exit, while recommending the manufacture of a artisanal mask to those who cannot buy it.
Masks were also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also called physical distance) includes measures to control infections aimed at slowing the spread of the disease by reducing contact between people.
Methods include quarantine, travel restrictions and closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres and shopping centres.
Social distancing methods can be applied by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowds, avoiding contact and keeping a physical distance with others.
Many governments are now ordering or recommending social distancing in the areas affected by the epidemic.
The maximum level of meetings recommended by U.S. government and health agencies has been reduced rapidly from 250 people (if there is no known presence of COVID-19 in the region) to 50 people, and later to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. Older adults and those with underlying health problems such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension or a weakened immune system have an increased risk of serious illness and complications. Thus, they were invited by the CDC to stay at home as much as possible in areas affected by the epidemic. By the end of March 2020, WHO and other health organizations began to replace the term "social distance" with "physical distance", to clarify the objective of reducing physical contact by maintaining social links, whether virtual or by maintaining distance.
The use of the term "social distancing" meant that a total social isolation should be used instead of encouraging people to keep in touch with others through other means. Some authorities published guidelines on sexual health to be followed during the pandemic.
They include the recommendation to have sexual intercourse only with a person with whom you live, who does not have the virus or who does not have the symptoms.
Isolation at home has been recommended for people diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who think they are infected.
Health organizations have issued detailed instructions for correct isolation. Many governments have imposed or recommended individual quarantine for entire populations living in affected areas.
The most stringent individual quarantine instructions were given to the most at risk groups.
Those who have been exposed to a patient with COVID-19 and those who have recently travelled to a country or region where transmission is very important were invited to stay in quarantine for 14 days from the moment they were last exposed.
The control strategies of an epidemic are harassment or suppression, and mitigation.
Indication is in place during the early stages of the epidemic and aims to monitor and isolate infected people, as well as to introduce other measures to control infections and vaccination to prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to prevent the spread of the disease, efforts are being made towards the mitigation phase: measures are being taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the health care system and society.
Measures to tackle and mitigate may be taken at the same time.
The suppression requires more extreme measures, in order to affect the pandemic by reducing the basic reproduction number to less than 1. Part of the management of an infectious disease epidemic is to try to mitigate the epidemic peak: this is what the epidemic curve is called flattening.
This reduces the risk of overloading health services and increasing time for vaccine and treatment development.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can manage the epidemic include personal prevention measures, such as hand hygiene, masking and individual quarantine; public social distancing measures such as the closure of schools and religious offices; a public effort to encourage the acceptance and participation of such interventions; as well as environmental actions such as surface cleaning. More drastic measures have been taken in China as long as the severity of the epidemic has become apparent, such as the quarantine of entire cities and a strict ban on travel.
Other countries have also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced mass screening and quarantine, and issued alerts on the displacement of infected persons.
Singapore has provided financial support to those infected who have become quarantined, and has imposed heavy fines on those who have not.
Taiwan has increased the production of masks and sanctioned the seizure of medical supplies. simulations for Britain and the United States show that mitigation (the slowdown but not the elimination of the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (reversing the development of the epidemic) face major challenges.
Optimum mitigation policies can reduce demand for health care by 2/3 and deaths by half, but cannot prevent hundreds of thousands of deaths, and health care systems are submerged.
Removal may be preferred, but must be continued as long as the virus circulates in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if this happens first), because otherwise, transmission is rapidly rebounded when measures are released.
Long-term intervention to eliminate the pandemic has a social and economic cost.
There are no approved antiviral treatments for COVID-19, but development efforts are under way, including existing treatment tests.
Taking medicines without a prescription against cold or drinking and rest may help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous infusions and respiratory assistance may be necessary.
The use of steroids may exacerbate the results.
Several compounds that have already been approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are currently being studied for the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO stated that some "traditional and artisanal remedies" may soften the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
Increased capacity and adaptation of health care to the needs of patients with COVID-19 is described by WHO as a fundamental response measure to the epidemic.
The ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have published guidelines to the attention of primary health care hospitals and services for the redeployment of resources at different levels, including by devoting laboratory services to COVID-19 tests, cancelling non-emergency interventions where possible, separating and insulating patients tested positively at COVID-19, and strengthening intensive care capacities through staff training and increasing the number of fans and beds available.
There are various theories concerning the place of origin of the first case (called zero patient).
The first known case of the new coronavirus could date back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
In one month, the number of cases of coronavirus in Hubei gradually increased.
They are generally linked to the market for large seafood from Huanan, which also sold live animals. According to one theory, the virus would come from one of these animals; in other words, it would have a zoonotic origin. An unknown cause pneumonia home was observed on December 26 and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at the Hubei province hospital, which informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on December 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors from Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues of a "coronavirus similar to SARS".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were reprimanded by the police for spreading false rumors, and another, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by his superiors for giving the alert.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission then published a public opinion on 31 December and informed WHO.
There were enough cases of unknown pneumonia reported to the Wuhan health authorities to initiate an investigation early in January. At the early stages of the epidemic, the number of cases doubled about every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, assisted by Chinese New Year's migrations and the fact that Wuhan is a transport hub as well as a major railway correspondence site.
On January 20, China reported almost 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
The following official data show that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms on 20 January 2020. On 26 March, the United States exceeded China and Italy by displaying the largest number of confirmed cases in the world. On 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide; over 97,000 people died and over 364,000 were cured.
About 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
Because of the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have restricted movement and established border controls.
National responses included measures such as quarantine (also called housekeeping, shelter or containment orders) and fire cover. On 2 April, nearly 300 million people, or approximately 90 per cent of the population, are subject to a form of containment in the United States, more than 50 million people are confined in the Philippines, about 59 million in South Africa and 1.3 billion in India.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people around the world were suffering from a form of confinement, a figure of 2.6 billion two days later — about one third of the world's population.
The origin of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was dated 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report suggests that the first case would be dated 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a home of unknown cause pneumonia on December 26, which she informed Wuhan Jianghan's CDC on December 27.
Initial genetic tests of patient samples on December 27, 2019 indicated the presence of a coronavirus similar to SARS.
A public opinion was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on 31 December.
WHO was informed on the same day.
The doctors in Wuhan received a warning for having "preached rumors" about the epidemic.
The National Health Commission of China initially claimed that there was no "evident evidence" of transmission between human beings.
At the end of January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign, later described by the Secretary General of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping as a "people's war" to curb the spread of the virus.
In what has been described as "the greatest quarantine in human history", a health cord was announced on January 23 to stop travel to and from Wuhan, which was extended to 15 cities in Hubei, reaching about 57 million people in total.
The use of private vehicles has been prohibited in the city.
The New Chinese Year celebrations (January 25) were cancelled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital was later built: Leishenshan, to treat additional patients.
In addition to the new hospitals, China has converted 14 other structures to Wuhan, such as congress and stadium centres, into temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the government introduced new measures to curb the COVID-19 epidemic, including the issuance of health statements for travellers and the extension of holidays at the Spring.
The universities and schools in the country have also been closed.
The regions of Hong Kong and Macao have implemented several measures, particularly with regard to schools and universities.
Distance work measures have been introduced in several Chinese regions.
Travel restrictions were adopted in Hubei and beyond.
Public transport has been modified and museums in China have been temporarily closed.
The control of population movements has been applied in many cities, and it has been estimated that approximately 760 million people (more than half of the population) have been involved in some form of displacement restriction. After the epidemic entered the world stage in March, the Chinese authorities have taken strict measures to prevent the virus from being "imported" from other countries.
For example, Beijing imposed a 14-day stay for all international travellers entering the city. On 23 March, in mainland China, only one case had been transmitted within the country in the previous five days, in this case via a traveler returning to Canton from Istanbul.

On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to apply a travel ban in Wuhan, the representative of WHO Gauden Galea noted that even if it was not "a recommendation of WHO", it was however "a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic where it is most concentrated" and spoke of a fact "unprecedented in the history of public health". On 30 January, following confirmation of an interhuman transmission outside China and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, the WHO stated that the epidemic constituted an international public health emergency (USPPI), the sixth USIPI since the measure was invoked during the 2009 influenza A pandemic.
The Director General of WHO Tedros Adhanom stated that the USPPI was due to "the risk of global spread, particularly for low-income and middle-income countries without robust health systems.
In response to the application of travel restrictions, Tedros stated: "There is no reason for measures to interfere unnecessarily with international travel and trade" and "WHO does not recommend restricting trade and movement."
On 5 February, WHO called on the international community to contribute $675 million to support strategic preparedness in low-income countries, calling for the urgent need to support those countries that “did not have the necessary systems to detect those who contracted the virus, even if it was about to appear”.

On 14 February, a WHO-led joint mission team was activated in China to dispatch international experts and WHO on-site in China to support national management and assess "seriousness and transmission of disease" by organizing workshops and meetings with major national institutions and conducting field visits to assess "the impact of response activities at the provincial and county levels, including in urban and rural areas."On 25 February, WHO stated that "the world should do more to prepare for a possible pandemic of coronary virus", indicating that although it is too early to speak about the pandemic, each country should nevertheless enter "preparation phase".

Mike Ryan, Executive Director of the WHO Health Emergency Management Program, warned in a statement: "This is a return to reality for every government on the planet: wake up.
This virus may be on its way and you must be ready," adding that good response measures could help the world avoid "the worst."
Ryan then indicated that current data did not allow public health officials to announce a global pandemic, stating that such a declaration would mean that "we accept in the absolute case that every human on the planet is exposed to this virus."
On March 11, WHO stated that the Coronavirus epidemic could be classified as a pandemic.
The Director General stated that WHO was "extremely concerned both by alarming levels of spread and severity and by alarming levels of inaction."

Some commentators believe that this action was intended to protect the Secretary General of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping from popular anger in relation to the Coronavirus epidemic.
Some Chinese senior officials, e.g. Zhao Lijian, rejected the first idea that the Coronavirus epidemic would have begun in Wuhan in favor of conspiracy theories claiming that COVID-19 would have its origins in the United States or Italy.
The U.S. administration of Donald Trump called the coronavirus "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus", stating that in China "censorship has overfed a virus that has now become a global pandemic", which has been taxed by some opponents and "distorting the attention of its administration's inability to contain the disease".
The Daily Beast has obtained a telegram from the U.S. government setting out the main lines of a communication strategy apparently emanating from the National Security Council, which is quoted as follows: "Everything comes from China.

The President of Iran Hassan Yeriman wrote an open letter to world leaders asking for help on March 14, 2020, indicating that his country had a hard time fighting the epidemic due to the lack of access to international markets due to United States sanctions against Iran. The epidemic triggered calls for the United States to adopt common social policies in other rich countries, including a universal health care system, a universal childcare program, paid parental leave and higher levels of public health funding.
Political analysts expect this to adversely affect Donald Trump's chances of re-election during the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have deteriorated due to the pandemic.

The technology sector, in particular, has warned about delays in sending electronic products.
According to WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for individual protection equipment has been multiplied by 100.

This has also resulted in a shortage of individual protection equipment worldwide and WHO warns that this will endanger health professionals.
In Australia, the pandemic offered a new opportunity to the Dagou to sell Australian products in China.
The activity created a shortage of infant milk in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in Northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the high demand for food that followed, these two areas were spared from severe food shortages.
The measures taken by China and Italy against the illegal storage and trade in essential products have been a real success, thus avoiding the serious food shortages that had been foreseen in Europe and North America.
Thanks to its large agricultural production, Northern Italy has not seen a significant decrease, but prices could increase according to industry representatives.
Food rays have only been emptied temporarily, even in the city of Wuhan, while members of the Chinese government have unlocked pig reserves to ensure adequate livelihood of the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy so that food producers store reserves for such emergencies.

According to an estimate by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession caused by the pandemic could leave between 14 and 22 million additional people in extreme poverty in Latin America compared to a situation without pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the outbreak in Wuhan, approximately 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
In China, a large part of the approximately 300 million rural migrant workers found themselves locked up in domestic provinces or stuck in the province of Hubei. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
The Coronavirus epidemic could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32 per cent, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis estimates. The Indian containment has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (receiving a daily wage) unemployed. Angus Reid's survey found that 44% of Canadian households had experienced a certain type of unemployment. Nearly 900,000 workers have lost their jobs in Spain since the containment imposed on mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for universal credit. Nearly half a million German companies had their employees lowered to a partial activity scheme subsidized by the government called Kurzarbeit.
The German partial-time work compensation scheme was adopted by France and Great Britain.
The arts and cultural heritage sectors have been deeply affected by the pandemic, affecting the functioning of organizations and individuals, both waged and self-employed, at the global level.
The arts and culture sector organizations have tried to maintain their mission (often funded by the State) to provide access to the cultural heritage of the community, ensure the safety of their employees and the public and support artists to the extent possible.
In March 2020, museums, libraries, showrooms and other cultural institutions were closed to new order and their exhibitions, events and representations cancelled or postponed.
In response, intensive efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and accelerated consequence of the disease, the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences and fashion parades.
The film industry also suffered a disruption. The Vatican announced that the celebrations of the Holy Week in Rome, which took place in the last week of the period of Christian Penitence of Lent, had been cancelled.
Many dioceses recommended that older Christians stay at home rather than attend Sunday Mass; some churches broadcast their religious services on radio, online, live or television, while others propose to practice their worship as "drive-in".
Like the Roman Catholic diocese of Rome, which closed its churches and chapels and St. Peter's Square, which emptied itself from all its Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also cancelled their services and limited public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
The Iranian Minister of Health announced the cancellation of Friday's prayers in the areas affected by the epidemic and the holy places were subsequently closed, while Saudi Arabia prohibited the entry of foreign pilgrims and its inhabitants to the sacred sites of La Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the biggest interruption of the world's sports calendar since World War II.
The most important sporting events were either cancelled or postponed, including the UEFA 2019-20 Champions League, the 2019-20 British Football Championship, the UEFA Euro 2020, the NBA 2019-20 season and the 2019-20 NHL season.
The epidemic disrupted the organization of the 2020 Summer Olympic Games, which was initially to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be "replanned beyond 2020, but no later than the summer 2021". Casinos and other gaming establishments around the world have closed and live poker tournaments have either been postponed or cancelled.
This has prompted many players to sign up online, and many online gaming sites have seen a significant increase in their number of new registrations. The world of the show has also been touched, with several music groups that have suspended or cancelled their concert tours.
Many major theatres, such as Broadway theatres, have also interrupted all their performances.
Some artists have sought ways to continue to create and share their work on the Internet in place of traditional live performances, such as online and live concerts or online "festivals" created for artists to produce, disseminate and promote their works.
Online, many Internet themes on the theme of the coronavirus have spread because many prefer humor and distraction in the face of uncertainty.
Since the COVID-19 epidemic, a rise in prejudices, xenophobia and racism has been observed against people of Chinese and East Asian origin, as well as people from sensitive areas in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents related to fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports dated February (when the majority of cases were still limited to China) described racist feelings expressed in different groups around the world that Chinese deserved the virus or received justified punishment.
Some African countries have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many inhabitants of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
Support was provided to the Chinese, whether online or offline, and to the inhabitants of areas affected by the virus.
As a result of the spread of the epidemic towards new sensitive countries, the Italians, who live in the first country of Europe having suffered a serious COVID-19 epidemic, could also face suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed petitions to prohibit Chinese from entering their countries in order to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChinaDontComeToJapan raged on Twitter.
Chinese and other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States reported an increase in levels of racist insults, as well as aggression.
U.S. President Donald Trump faced criticism for calling the coronavirus "Chinese virus", a term considered by his detractors as racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreign evacuations between Wuhan and Novi Sanzhary.
Students from North-East India, who share a border with China, and students in large Indian cities would have been harassed in connection with the Coronavirus epidemic.
The president of the Bharatiya West Bengal-Western unity Janata Party Dilip Ghosh said that the Chinese had destroyed nature and "that is why God took revenge on them."
The comments were subsequently condemned by the Chinese consulate in Kolkata, which calls them "false". In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese inhabitants were attracted by the pandemic, with foreigners being described as "foreign waste" that should be "eliminated".
Many pay access newspapers have withdrawn them for all or part of their coverage on the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have made their scientific articles available in connection with the epidemic for free access.
Some scientists have chosen to share their results quickly on pre-publication servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory screening of the 2019 coronary artery disease (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods for detecting the virus and detecting antibodies produced in response to the infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This analysis is specifically designed to detect only SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
The detection of antibodies (serology) can be used both for the diagnosis and monitoring of the population.
Antibody tests reveal how many people have contracted the disease, including people whose symptoms were too light to be declared or asymptomatic.
An exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of collective immunity among the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited screening, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population in March 2020.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3 per cent of its population, and there were significant differences in the number of tests carried out in each country.
This variability is likely to significantly affect the reported lethality rates, which are likely to be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Using reverse transcription followed by a real-time chain polymerization reaction (RRT-PCR), the test can be performed on respiratory samples obtained using various methods, including the nasopharyngeal elbow or the expectoration sample.
Results are generally available within a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR test performed from pharynxed elbows is only reliable during the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus can disappear from the throat while continuing to multiply in the lungs.
In infected individuals tested during the second week, a sample can also be taken in deep airways by aspiration catheter, or a cracking (expectoration) can be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed by Charité in Berlin in January 2020 using reverse transcription followed by a real-time chain polymerization reaction (RRT-PCR), and was the base of 250,000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK had also developed a test as of January 23, 2020.The South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical-quality SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on the PCR (PowerCheck Coronavirus) on January 28, 2020.
It detects the "E" gene shared by all beta-coronavirus, and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2.In China, the BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive the authorization of emergency use of the Chinese National Medical Products Administration for a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC) distribute their diagnostic devices by RT-PCR in real time of the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) to public health laboratories through the International reagent resource.
Among the old versions of the test kits, a genetic test of three obtained non-conclusive results due to defective reagents, as well as a screening of the test strangulation at the Atlanta CDC. As a result, an average of less than 100 samples per day were successfully treated throughout February 2020.
Tests using two components were not considered reliable until February 28, 2020, and it was only at this time that federal and local laboratories were authorized to start testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency authorization.The U.S. commercial laboratories began testing early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the national availability of RT-PCR-based COVID-19 tests.
This Diagnostics also distributed national COVID-19 tests on March 9, 2020.
No quantitative limitation has been announced. Sample collection and processing must be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDCs.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the VECTOR National Research Centre for Virology and Biotechnology.
On February 11, 2020, the test was recorded by the Federal Health Surveillance Service. On March 12, 2020, it was announced that Mayo Clinic had developed a COVID-19 infection detection test.On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics was authorized by the FDA for a test that could be performed in large quantities in 3.5 hours, allowing for approximately 4 128 tests in 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA granted an Emergency Use Authorisation (USA) to Abbott Laboratories for a test on Abbott's m2000 system. The FDA had previously granted a similar authorisation to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received a U.S. from the FDA for a test taking approximately 45 minutes.
The FDA approved a test using the nucleic acid isothermal amplification technology instead of the CRP.
Since it does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results in only five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these devices in the United States, and Abbott plans to intensify manufacturing to provide 50,000 tests per day.A test using a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the nucleocapside protein (N protein) of the new coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan, hoping it can provide results in 15 to 20 minutes, such as a quick influenza test.
A bibliographic study of March 2020 concluded that "pulmonary X-rays present low diagnostic value at the early stages, while TDM results [tomodensitometry] may be conclusive before symptoms occur."
Typical symptoms on TDM include multi-lobary bilateral depoliated glass opacitys with peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution.
A subpleural predominance, a "crazy paving" and a consolidation develop as the disease evolves.
A study comparing PCR to TDM in Wuhan, at the point of origin of the current pandemic, suggested that TDM is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less precise, several of its imaging results coincidering with other pneumonias and diseases.
In March 2020, the U.S. College of Radiology recommends that "TDM not be used for screening or as a front-line test to diagnose COVID-19."In March 2020, the CDC recommended the PCR for initial screening.
The production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG, is part of the immune response to infection.
These can be used to detect infection in people from approximately 7 days after symptoms occur, to determine immunity and in the context of population surveillance.Tests can be performed in central laboratories (CTAs) or by patient's hair test (point-of-care testing, POCT).
High-speed automated systems in many clinical laboratories are able to perform these analyses, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For CLT, a single sample of peripheral blood is generally used, although serial samples can be used to follow the immune response.
For POCT, a single blood sample is usually taken by skin puncture.
Unlike the PCR methods, no extraction steps are required prior to the analysis.On March 26, 2020, the FDA appointed 29 entities that have duly informed the agency and can therefore now distribute their antibody testing.
As of April 7, 2020, a single test was approved by the FDA under an emergency authorisation.By March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European authorisations for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The screening capacity is several hundred samples in a few hours, which is significantly faster than the viral RNA PCR test.
Antibodies are generally detectable 14 days after the start of the infection.In early April, the United Kingdom found that none of the antibody test kits purchased by the country were sufficiently effective for use.
Hong Kong has put in place a plan in which suspected cases may remain at home, "the emergency service will provide the patient with a sample tube", patients will crack inside, return and later receive the result of the test.The British NHS announced that it conducts a pilot project to test suspected cases at home, eliminating the risk that a patient will not infect others by going to a hospital or the need to disinfect an ambulance in case of use.In the COVID-19 test drive for suspected cases, a health professional will take a sample by taking appropriate precautions.
The "drive" centres allowed South Korea to carry out one of the fastest and most comprehensive screenings in the world.In Germany, the National Association of Compulsory Health Insurance Physicians stated on March 2 that it had the capacity to carry out some 12,000 tests per day in an outpatient environment, and that 10,700 patients had been tested during the previous week.
The costs are borne by health insurance when the test is prescribed by a doctor.
According to President Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
As of March 19, test drives were available in several major cities.
As at 26 March 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown, as only positive results are reported.
A first laboratory study revealed that at 12/2020, a total of at least 483 295 samples were tested up to week 12/2020 and 33 491 samples (6.9%) obtained a positive result for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers from the Technion and the Rambam hospital developed and tested a method of analysis of samples of 64 patients at once, by grouping samples and only testing if the combined sample is positive.In Wuhan, an improvised emergency detection laboratory of 2,000 square metres called "Huo-Yan" (in Chinese:  cut-off "Fire Eye" in French) was opened on 5 February 2020 by BGI, and may treat more than 10,000 samples per day.
Through its five-day construction supervised by Wang Jian, the founder of BGI, modeling revealed that cases in the province of Hubei would have been 47 per cent higher and that the cost of quarantine would have doubled without this screening capacity.
The Wuhan laboratory was quickly followed by Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in 12 Chinese cities in total.
As of March 4, 2020, the total daily capacity was 50,000 tests per day.Free multiplexed models developed by Origami Assays were published to test up to 1,122 samples of patients for COVID-19 using only 93 tests. These balanced models can be performed in small laboratories without liquid-manipulative robots.
In March, insufficient reagent shortages and quantities became a bottleneck for mass testing in the EU, the United Kingdom and the United States.
This has prompted some authors to examine sample preparation protocols that involve heating samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genomes to continue testing.On March 31, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was now testing most of its population per capita for Coronavirus, and were in the process of intensifying the screening to reach the majority of the population.
These results were achieved through a combination of the ability to conduct test drives and the purchase of a high-speed laboratory across the population from Group 42 and BGI (based on their Huo-Yan emergency detection laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is able to conduct tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory of this capacity to be operational outside China.
Different test formulas targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted the German formula for manufacturing kits sent to low-income countries with no resources to develop their own kits.
The German formula was published on 17 January 2020. The protocol developed by the United States Disease Control Centres was published only on 28 January, delaying the availability of tests in the United States.China and the United States had problems with the reliability of test kits at the beginning of the epidemic, and those countries, as well as Australia, were unable to provide sufficient kits to respond to the request and recommendations for testing of health experts.
On the other hand, experts indicate that the wide availability of tests in South Korea has helped to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The screening capacity, largely in private sector laboratories, has been strengthened by the Government of South Korea over several years.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization recommended the intensification of screening programs as the best way to slow down the advance of the COVID-19 pandemic.The high demand for extensive testing due to the spread of the virus caused the delay of hundreds of thousands of tests in private laboratories in the United States, and the reserves of caves and chemical reagents were exhausted.
In March 2020, China reported problems related to the reliability of its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDCs presented "failure".The government then eliminated the bureaucratic barriers that impeded private testing.Spain purchased test kits from Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results were unreliable.
The company explained that the incorrect results could be related to the inability to collect samples or to use kits properly.
The Spanish Ministry stated that it will remove the kits that have given incorrect results, and replace them with another test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the test kits purchased in China by the Czech Republic have provided false results. Slovakia has purchased 1.2 million test kits from China that have proved defective.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested throwing them into the Danube. Ateş Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health stated that the test kits that Turkey purchased in China had a "high error rate" and did not "use them". The United Kingdom purchased 3.5 million test kits in China, but announced early April 2020 that they were useless.
The screening, followed by forty of those who obtain a positive result and the tracing of people who were in contact with SARS-CoV-2 carriers, resulted in positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the site of the first death related to COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two series of tests in the entire population of about 3,400 people, about ten days apart.
Almost half of the people with positive results did not have symptoms, and all discovered cases were quarantined.
With the restriction of travel in the municipality, this measure completely eliminated the new infections.
Thanks to the aggressive tracing of contacts, restrictions on incoming travel, screening and quarantine, the 2020 Coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has progressed much less rapidly than in other developed countries, but without extreme restrictions such as forced closure of restaurants and retail establishments.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore began advising residents to stay at home on March 28, but schools resumed on the scheduled date at the end of the holidays on March 23.
Several other countries also managed the pandemic through aggressive tracing of contacts, restrictions on incoming travel, screening and quarantine, but with less aggressive containments, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries with the highest number of tests, compared to the number of deaths, have significantly lower lethality rates, probably because these countries are more able to detect people with only mild symptoms or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries without analytical capacity and whose national laboratories have only limited experience of the COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and first ten negative samples of COVID-19 to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories to carry out confirmatory tests.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the "Positive in % of Tests" column depends on the national screening policy.
A country that tests only persons admitted to the hospital will have a positive value in % of tests higher than a country that tests all citizens, whether or not they have symptoms, the other factors being the same.
Hand washing, also called hand hygiene, corresponds to cleaning hands in order to remove dirt, fat, microorganisms or other undesirable substances.
The systematic washing of hands with soap at certain "key moments" of the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted by oro-faecal route.
Respiratory diseases such as flu or cold can be contracted, for example, by failing to wash your hands before touching your eyes, nose or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes).
It is important to wash your hands in soap at five key moments of the day: before and after the defecation, after cleaning a baby's buttocks or changing its layers, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
If you have no water or soap under your hand, you can wash your hands ash. The World Health Organization recommends washing your hands:
before, during and after the preparation of meals;
before and after taking care of a sick person;
after changing the layers of a baby or cleaning a child who has gone to the toilet;
after having soaked or coughed or sneezed;
having affected an animal, feed or waste of animal origin;
Hand hygiene in the medical environment refers to health practices related to medical procedures.
Washing your hands before administering medicines or providing medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of disease.
The primary medical objective of hand washing is to eliminate pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms likely to cause disease) and chemicals, which may be harmful or cause disease.
This practice is particularly important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but also for the general public.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
as well as the reduction in infant mortality rates during childbirth at home.
According to a 2013 study, improving hand hygiene practices could lead to a slight improvement in the growth of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory diseases and diarrhoea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioural changes, such as washing of hands to soap.
This simple practice can reduce the mortality rate associated with these diseases by almost 50%.
The introduction of actions to promote handwashing could reduce diarrhea episodes by about one third, a figure comparable to that obtained by providing drinking water to low-income regions.
Washing hands with soap helps to reduce diarrhea episodes by 48 per cent and is the most effective and cost-effective way to prevent acute diarrhea and respiratory infections (IRA). This is an act that must be done automatically in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the main IRAs, is the first cause of mortality among children under five years of age, which makes nearly 1.8 million victims a year.
Together, diarrhea and pneumonia cause almost 3.5 million children to die each year.
According to UNICEF, the habit of washing your hands with soap before eating and after going to the toilet can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce by nearly half deaths due to diarrhea and one quarter deaths due to acute respiratory infections.
Handwashing is generally associated with other health measures in the water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programs.
Handwashing also protects against impetigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
Minor deleterious effect, frequent handwashing may damage the skin by causing skin dryness.
A 2012 Danish study revealed that excessive handwashing could result in eczema or dermatitis at the hand level, characterized by squamous skin and itching, and particularly common among health workers.
Too frequent hand washing is also considered as one of the symptoms of compulsive obsessional disorder (OCD).
It is important to wash your hands in soap at five key moments of the day to reduce the oro-fecal transmission of the diseases: before and after using the toilets (mixion, defecation), after cleaning the buttocks of a baby (or changing its layers), before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
Hands should also be washed properly to prevent the transmission of diseases, including before and after having treated a cut or injury, after sneezing, coughing or biteing, after touching animal waste or handling animals, and after touching garbage.
In many countries, the rate of hand-cleaning of soap is low.
According to a study conducted in 2015 in 54 countries with regard to hand hygiene, 38.7% of households on average washed their hands with soap. A study carried out in 2014 showed that in Saudi Arabia the rate was the highest (97%), the United States was in the middle of the table (77%) and China was the lowest rate (23%). Today, there are several methods for changing behaviours and democratizing the use of soap for hand washing at key times of the day. In particular, in developing countries, it is possible to propose to schoolchildren to wash their hands in group at specific times of the day in order for children to make this habit.
For example, the Ministry of Education of the Philippines has implemented a "Primary Health Care Program" to promote the health and education of children.
The decay twice a year, associated with the daily washing of the hands with soap and the daily brushing of the teeth with a fluorinated toothpaste, is at the heart of this national program.
It was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
To better eliminate the microorganisms present on the skin, soap or detergents should be added to the water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce obstacles to the solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is not an effective cleaner for the skin since lipids and proteins, which are organic matter of the soil, are difficult to soluble in the water.
However, adequate water flow facilitates cleaning.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, may contain bacteria from previous uses.
A small number of studies on the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap concluded that the transfer was unlikely because the bacteria are rinsed with foam.
The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also indicates that “automatic liquid soap distributors are preferable”.
Antibacterial soaps have been strongly recommended to those who care about their health.
To date, there is no evidence suggesting that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants can target organisms resistant to antibiotics in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, to which many strains of organisms resist.
Therefore, even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not the result of antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as announced.
In addition to the surfactant and skin-protective agent, the most complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) used to regulate pH, benzoic acid, having an antimicrobial function, and other protective agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).A rigorous analysis of the University of Oregon's Public Health School indicated that ordinary soaps were as effective as antibacterial soaps intended for individuals and containing triclosan, to prevent disease and eliminate bacteria from hands.
The hot water used to wash your hands is not hot enough to kill the bacteria.
Bacteria increase much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, warm and soapy water is more effective than cold and soapy water to eliminate natural oils with dirt and bacteria.
But contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that the use of warm water did not contribute to reducing the microbial burden on the hands.
A disinfectant or an antiseptic for hands is a non-aqueous hand hygiene product.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-alcoholic hand hygiene products (commonly called hydro-alcoholic solutions, hand antiseptic solutions or hand disinfectants) began to become popular.
Most are formulated based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol associated with a thickening agent such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) to obtain a gel, or a moisturizer such as glycerin to obtain a liquid or foam for greater ease of use and reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide strengthens antimicrobial activity and disinfectants for hands containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol effectively eliminate germs.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions kill bacteria, multi-resistant bacteria (SARM and ERV), tuberculosis and certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, VRS, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis), as well as fungi.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions containing 70% alcohol eliminate 99.97% (decrease of 3.5, log equivalent to a reduction of 35 decibels) of bacteria present on the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (reduction of 4-5 log) of bacteria present on the hands 1 minute after application.Hand disinfectants are more effective against bacteria and less effective against certain viruses.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions are almost completely ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, the main cause of contagious gastroenteritis.A sufficient amount of disinfectant for hands or hydro-alcoholic solution must be used to properly wet or cover both hands.
The palm and the back of both hands and the interstices between the fingers and nails for about 30 seconds should be compared until the liquid, foam or dry gel.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends handwashing rather than the use of hydro-alcoholic solutions, especially when the hands are visibly dirty.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and their rapid disposal of microorganisms; however, they must not replace a handwashing appropriate unless you have water and soap at hand.
Frequent use of hydroalcoholic solutions may result in skin drying if the formula is not reinforced by emollients and/or skin moisturizing agents.
The drying effect of alcohol may be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
As part of clinical trials, hydroalcoholic solutions containing emollients have caused significantly less irritation and skin dryness than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact hive or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in hydro-alcoholic solutions are rare.
The fact that hydro-alcoholic solutions are less likely to cause irritant contact dermatitis has made them more attractive than washing hands in water and soap.
Despite their effectiveness, non-aqueous products do not remove the organic materials on their hands, but only disinfect them.
That is why hand disinfectants are not as effective as soap and water to avoid the spread of many pathogens, since they remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of disinfectants for non-alcoholic hands depends heavily on the ingredients and formula, and has always been significantly lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based disinfectants.
More recently, formulas using benzalkonium chloride have presented a sustainable and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose efficacy is reduced after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
In low-income populations, many are those who do not have the means to buy soap, and who use ash or land instead.
Ash or soil can be more effective than water alone, but less than soap.
What is more, if the soil or ash is contaminated by microorganisms, it may increase the spread of disease instead of curbing it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant because, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap when it is not available.
The U.S. Centre for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the proper washing of hands to prevent disease transmission, following the following steps:
Wet your hands with warm or cold running water.
Current water is recommended due to the risk of contamination of stagnant water points, while water temperature does not appear to make any difference).
Place a generous amount of soap on your hands by rubbing them against each other, not forgetting the back of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails.
Soap eliminates skin germs, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than using water alone.
Fret for at least 20 seconds.
The friction action creates friction, which helps eliminate the skin germs, and the longer friction removes more germs.
Rinse thoroughly with running water.
Rinsing in a stagnant watershed can lead to recontamination of hands.
Dry with a clean or outdoor towel.
Wet and wet hands come back more easily.The most often forgotten areas are the thumb, wrist, spaces between the fingers and under the nails.
Artificial nails and scaled nail polish can house microorganisms.
A moisturizing lotion is often recommended to avoid having dry hands; skin dryness promotes the emergence of skin lesions that may increase the risk of transmission of infections.
There are many economic alternatives to washing hands when tap water and/or soap are not available. For example, water flow from a slurry or tart suspended and pierced and/or used ash if needed in developing countries.In situations where water supply is limited (such as in schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as "typey-taps" and other economic options.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a crutch suspended using a rope, and a pedal allowing you to pour a small amount of water on your hands and a soap bread.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to dry hands in public toilets is to debate.
More and more research suggests that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric hand dryers than are often found in toilets.
In 2008, a paper industry-funded study, the European Fabric Symposium, was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, to compare the levels of hygiene offered by paper towels, hot air dryers and more modern air jet hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands in hot air dryers, it was found that the total number of bacteria increased by an average of 194% on the pulp of fingers and 254% on the palms.
Drying in air jet hands resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the 42% pulp of fingers and on the 15% palms.
After handwashing and drying with paper towels, the total number of bacteria was reduced by an average of 76% on the pulp of fingers and up to 77% on the palms.Scientists also conducted tests to determine whether there was any potential for cross-contamination with other toilet users and the toilet environment according to each drying method.
The air jet hand dryer, which blowes from the air out of the aircraft at announced speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of expelling micro-organisms from the hands and apparatus and possibly contaminate other users of the toilets as well as the toilet environment in a perimeter of up to 2 meters.
The use of a hot-air hand dryer allows the spread of microorganisms at a maximum distance of 0.25 meters from the hand dryer.
Paper towels revealed that there was no significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by the TÜV Product und Umwelt, different hand drying methods were evaluated.
After hand drying, the following variations in bacterial number were observed:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and the hand dryers have been compared to drying using paper towels.
Washing hands with disinfectant sheets is an alternative solution during travel, in the absence of soap and water.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Washing hands in the medical environment became mandatory long after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) to prevent disease in the hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that emit reminders when hospital staff forget to wash their hands.
One study found that their use resulted in a decrease in infection rates.
Medical hand washing must last at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or gel to make each part of the hands moist and rub.
Hands must be rubbed against each other by crossing between fingers.
In case of residues under the nails, it is possible to use a hair brush to remove them.
Since the germs present in the water are likely to remain on the hands, it is important to rinse and wipe with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the tap (and open the exit door if applicable).
This avoids recontamination of hands to the contact of surfaces.
The aim of hand washing in health structures is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and to avoid transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the insufficient rate of hand cleaning remains unacceptable in most medical facilities, a large number of doctors and nurses who regularly forget to wash their hands before touching their patients, which promotes the transmission of micro-organisms.
According to one study, handwashing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related blood infections by 66 per cent. The World Health Organization has published a brochure describing the standard procedure for washing and rubbing hands in the field of health.
The draft guidelines on hand hygiene prepared by the Organization can also be consulted on the website to collect comments from web users.
A relevant analysis was conducted by Whitby et al.
Available devices in trade can measure and certify hand hygiene if compliance with the regulations is proven.
The World Health Organization defines "Five indications" concerning hand hygiene:
after exposure to blood/biological fluid;
before an aseptic gesture; and
After having had contact with the patient. Adding antiseptic chemicals to the soap (we know "medical" or "antimicrobial") provides the handwashing agent with action to destroy germs.
It is desirable to remove these germs before performing surgery or in environments where antibiotics-resistant organisms are very widespread. To "frotter" hands for surgery, it is necessary to have a tap that can be opened and closed without touching it with hands, a product of washing based on chlorhexidine or iodine, sterile towels to dry hands after washing them, a sterile brush to rub and another sterile instrument to clean under the nails.
All jewels must be removed.
In this procedure, it is necessary to wash your hands and arms up to the elbow, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
There is no need to rub hands for 10 minutes.
When rinsing, water on the forearms should not flow to the hands.
Once the hands are washed, hands should be dried using sterile linen and a surgical jacket should be fitted.
In order to reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for your hands before and after taking care of a sick person.
Regarding the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of hand washing were obtained during the first 20 per cent of washing, and that there was only very little additional benefit to increase the hand washing frequency beyond 35%.
Comparing hand washing with an ordinary soap with an antibacterial soap, the rate of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted to foods is more than three times higher. Similarly, comparing hand cleaning with an alcohol-based solution and hand washing with an antibacterial soap for an average of 30 seconds each, the first reduction is found to reduce bacterial contamination by 26% compared to the second.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based products to reduce influenza A virus (H1N1) and the difficult Clostridium spores present on the hands. In order to improve the hygiene of hands in health care facilities, it is possible, inter alia, to train staff to wash their hands, to make more alcohol-based products available to them and to provide written and verbal reminders on this subject.
Further research is needed to find out which interventions are most effective in different health structures.
In developing countries, hand-washing soap is considered an inexpensive and essential tool to preserve health, or even to feed properly.
However, due to the lack of reliable water points, soap or facilities to wash your hands at home, at school and at work, it is difficult to achieve universal hand hygiene habits.
For example, in most rural Africa, it is rare to find taps to wash your hands close to private or public toilets, despite the existence of economic options to build hand washing stations.
However, low hand washing rates may also be due to tenacious habits, rather than lack of soap or water.
Promoting hand-washing and awareness-raising activities in this regard can influence political decisions, publicize the benefits of this practice and lead to a change in long-term behaviour within the population.
In order to achieve this, follow-up and evaluation activities are required.
A systematic review of 70 studies revealed that local approaches are effective in increasing the hand-washing rate in low and middle-income countries, and that social marketing campaigns are less effective; with regard to the promotion of hand-washing in schools, the example of UNICEF's "Three Star Approach", which encourages schools to take simple and inexpensive measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap while respecting other hygiene rules.
Once minimum standards are reached, schools can move from one to three final stars.
The construction of hand-washing stations can be part of the promotion campaigns of hand hygiene that are carried out to reduce diseases and infant mortality.
The World Day of Handwashing is another example of an awareness campaign that claims to promote behavioural evolution.Following the 2019-2020 Coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF encouraged the adoption of an emoji that illustrates handwashing.
Few studies have examined the overall cost-effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries compared with the number of years of healthy life earned (i.e., avoided DALY).
However, a review suggests that the promotion of washing hands with soap is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of handwashing for human health, especially for people in vulnerable situations such as birth mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals, was identified for the first time in the middle of the 19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the British "founder of modern nursing care".
At that time, most people still believed that infections were due to the fetidal smells called miasmes.
In the 1980s, food epidemics and nosocomial infections led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote hand hygiene more actively as an essential means of preventing the spread of infections.
The emergence of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 led to greater awareness in many countries of the need to wash their hands with soap to prevent these infectious diseases.
In Germany, for example, posters illustrating "good hand washing techniques" were placed next to sinks in public toilets and in office buildings and airports.
The term "washing hands" refers to a person's refusal to assume responsibility or to be complicit in something.
It comes from a biblical verse from Matthew in which Pontius Pilate washes his hands from the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but this expression has spread widely in some English communities.
In Macbeth, of Shakespeare, Lady Macbeth undertakes to wash her hands compulsively to try to clean up an imaginary stain, symbol of her bad conscience in view of the crimes she committed and that she encouraged her husband to commit.
It was also found that some people, after remembering that they had committed or planned to do something contrary to ethics, tend to wash their hands more often than others and give more value to handwashing devices.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after having had such thoughts are less inclined to engage in other compensatory "purification" measures, such as volunteering.
Some religions prescribe the washing of hands for both hygienic and symbolic purposes. The symbolic washing of hands, which consists of the use of water and not of soap to wash their hands, is part of the rituals of hand washing put forth in many religions, including Baha'ism and Hinduism, immersion (tevilah) and ritual ablution of hands (Nétilat Yadayim) in Judaism, washbasin in Christianity and wudhu in Islam. Religions also prescribe the washing of hands for hygienic purposes, especially after certain actions.
According to Hinduism, Judaism and Islam, it is mandatory to wash your hands after going to the toilet.
Similarly, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam demand to wash their hands before and after each meal.
COVID-19 risk controls at the workplace
The workplace risk controls of COVID-19 refer to the implementation of occupational health and safety methodologies for the control of risks for the prevention of COVID 2019 (COVID-19).
Adequate workplace risk controls vary depending on the workplace and the tasks, based on an assessment of the risks of sources of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community and individual risk factors of workers who may be vulnerable to an infection by VOCID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the lowest exposure risk jobs have minimal professional contact with the public and other employees. In this case, only basic prevention measures against infection are recommended, including hand washing, encouragement of workers to stay at home if they are sick, respiratory label, and maintenance of routine cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
Average exposure risk jobs include those requiring frequent or close contacts with persons without COVID-19 suspected or known but which may be infected due to an ongoing Community transmission or international travel.
This includes workers in contact with the general public, particularly in schools, high-density working environments and some large-scale retail environments.
Risk controls in this group, in addition to the basic measures to prevent infection, include ventilation using highly effective air filters, hygienic windows and the provision of individual protective equipment in the event of encountering a person with COVID-19.
OSHA considers health workers and funeral workers exposed to persons with a suspected or known COVID-19 as high exposure risk, to a very high risk if they perform procedures producing aerosols or sampling or handling of samples of persons with a suspected or known COVID-19.
The appropriate risk controls for these workers include technical controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and individual protective equipment adapted to the task.
COVID-19 epidemics may have several effects at the workplace.
Workers may be absent because they have fallen sick, have to take care of other people or fear a possible exposure.
Commercial models may change, both in terms of the goods requested and the means to acquire them (including running outside the peak hours or using delivery or drive services).
Finally, the shipment of articles from geographical areas severely affected by the COVID-19 may be interrupted. A plan to prepare and respond to infectious diseases can be used as a guide for protective measures.
The plans shall take into account the risk levels associated with different workplaces and tasks, including sources of exposure, risk factors related to the family and community context and individual risk factors of workers such as advanced age or chronic pathologies.
They also sketch out the controls necessary to address these risks and emergency plans for situations likely to arise as a result of the epidemics.
Infectious disease preparedness and response plans may be the subject of national or regional recommendations.
Response targets to an epidemic include reduction of transmission among staff, protection of persons at higher risk of medical complications, maintenance of commercial operations and reduction of adverse effects on other entities of their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community where the company is located influences the responses applied.
The risk control hierarchy forms a framework that is generally used in occupational health and safety in order to group risk controls by efficiency.
Where the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are the technical controls, followed by administrative controls and finally personal protective equipment.
Technical controls involve insulating employees from work risks without having to rely on the behaviour of workers, which can be the most economical solution to be implemented.
Administrative controls shall mean changes in policies or procedures at work that require action by the worker or employer.
Individual protective equipment (IPI) is considered less effective than technical and administrative controls, but may help prevent certain exposures.
All types of PPE must be selected according to the risk for the worker, properly adapted to the needs (e.g. respiratory masks), properly and systematically worn, inspected regularly, maintained and replaced as required, and properly removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the lowest exposure risk jobs have minimal professional contact with the public and other employees.
Basic measures to prevent infection recommended for all workplaces include frequent and thorough handwashing, encouragement of workers to stay at home if they are sick, respiratory labelling, including covering their mouth and nose for coughing and sneezing, providing handkerchiefs and garbage, preparing for telework or working hours if necessary, deterring workers from using other people's tools and equipment and maintaining routine cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
The rapid identification and isolation of potentially infectious persons is a crucial step in the protection of workers, customers, visitors and others at a workplace.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States recommend employees with symptoms of acute respiratory disease to stay at home until they present no more fever, signs of fever or any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of fever or other medicines acting on symptoms. They also recommend applying flexible sick leave policies, allowing employees to stay at home to take care of a sick family member and to inform employees of these policies.
According to the OSHA, average exposure risk jobs include those that require frequent or close contact, less than six feet (1.8 m), of persons without COVID-19 suspected or known but which may be infected by SARS-CoV-2 due to a Community transmission in progress around the company's headquarters or because the person has recently made an international trip to a region with widespread transmission of COVID-19.
This includes workers in contact with the general public, notably in schools, high-density working environments and certain high-volume retail environments. Technical controls for this group and those at higher risk include the installation of highly effective air filters, increased ventilation rates, installation of individual physical barriers such as transparent plastic screen hygienic protection and installation of a drive window for customer service. Administrative controls for this group and those at higher risk include the encouragement of sick workers to stay at home, replacement of in-person meetings by virtual communications, the provision of working hours of which are a step-by-step protection, interruption of non-essential journeys to areas with active COVID-19 epidemics, the development of emergency communication plans, including a forum to respond to workers' concerns, provision of information workers and training on the provision of basic training on protection of workers, and the provision of training on the basis of personal and personal risk factors, and training of workers in the field of work, and the provision of training of training of workers in the field of work, the provision of information workers of work and the provision of training on the provision of training on the protection of personal protection of workers in the environment, the environment, the provision of personal and the means of the means of the means of the means of the means of the means of personal and of the means of the means of the means of the means of the means of the means of the means of the means of living and of the means of living and of living and of living and of living and of living and of living and of living and of the means of living and of living and of living and of the means of living and of living and of living and of living and the means of living and of living and of living and of living in the means of living in the means of living and of living and of living and of living and of living in the means of living and of living and of living and of living in the means of living and of living in the environment. of living and of living and of living and of living in the means of living and of living and of living and of living and of living and of living and of living in the means of working in the means of living in the means of living and of living and of working in the means of living and of living in the means of working in the environment.
Workers in this risk group rarely need to use respiratory masks.
If a person falls ill on board an airplane, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include the following measures: separating the patient from others by a distance of 6 feet, appointing a crew member to take care of the patient and offering a protection mask to the patient or asking him to cover his or her mouth and nose using handkerchiefs when he or she coughs or sneezes.
The cabin crew shall carry disposable medical gloves when dealing with a sick passenger or affects organic fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces and, where possible, additional personal protective equipment if the sick passenger is suffering from fever, persistent cough or respiratory difficulties.
Gloves and other disposable items must be disposed of in a bag intended for hazardous biological waste and contaminated surfaces must be cleaned and disinfected thereafter. For commercial navigation, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, risk controls include the postponement of travel in case of illness as well as the self-isolation and immediate information of the medical centre on board if a fever or other symptom is developed once on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up should take place in the cabin of the isolated person. For schools and childcare facilities, the CDCs recommend a short-term closure for cleaning and disinfection purposes if an infected person has visited a school building, regardless of the community's spread.
In the event of minimal to moderate community transmission, social distancing strategies may be implemented, such as the cancellation of educational exits, assemblies and other important gatherings such as physical or choral education courses or canteen meals, increasing the space between offices, staging arrival and exit times, reducing non-essential visitors and using separate nursing for children with flu symptoms.
In the event of significant transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, an extension of school holidays can be considered. For law enforcement who carry out daily routine activities, the immediate health risk is considered to be low by the CDCs.
Police officers who must contact persons with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 must follow the same guidelines as ambulances, including the port of adequate personal protective equipment.
In the event of close contact during an arrest, workers must clean and disinfect their equipment and service belt before re-use using a linen or spray cleaning house and follow standard procedures for containment and disposal of worn PPEs as well as clothing containment and washing.
OSHA considers some health and funeral workers to be members of high or very high exposure categories.
High exposure risk jobs include health care, support, laboratory and medical transportation workers who are exposed to patients with suspected or known COVID-19.
They become very high exposure risk workers if they perform procedures producing aerosols or sampling or handling samples of patients with suspected or known COVID-19.
Aerosol procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchioscopy, certain dental examinations and procedures or invasive sampling.
High-exposure funeral jobs include workers involved in the preparation of the bodies of persons with COVID-19 suspected or known at the time of death; they pass to a very high risk of exposure if they perform an autopsy. Additional technical controls of these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with COVID-19 suspected or known, including when conducting procedures producing aerosols.
Specialized negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in certain health and funeral environments.
Samples should be handled using level 3 biological safety precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends separating patients entering separate waiting rooms based on the suspicion of COVID-19. In addition to other IPEs, OSHA recommends respiratory masks for persons working less than 6 feet of patients with a suspected or known SARS-CoV-2 infection and those performing aerosol-producing procedures.
In the United States, N95-approved or higher NIOSH-approved respiratory masks must be used in the context of a comprehensive and written respiratory protection program including adaptation, training and medical examinations.
Other types of respiratory masks can provide superior protection and better comfort for the worker. WHO does not recommend combinations, because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than transmitted by organic fluids.
WHO recommends wearing a surgical mask only by screening personnel at the point of entry.
For those who collect respiratory samples, take care of or carry COVID-19 patients in the absence of aerosol procedures, WHO recommends a surgical mask, protective glasses or facial screen, blouse and gloves.
In case of aerosol procedure, the surgical mask is replaced by a respiratory mask N95 or FFP2.
As the global provision of PPE is insufficient, WHO recommends limiting the need for PPE through telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, limiting access to a site occupied by a COVID-19 patient to people directly involved in its care, using the PPE necessary for the specific task only, continuing use of the same respiratory mask without removing it for the care of several patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordination of the PPE supply chain and dissuasing the use of masks for asymptomatic individuals.

OBJET: [Covid-19] To lighten the load and prepare the future
DATE/HOUR OF SEND: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
LICENCE : CC0 : No rights reserved
We are in an exceptional situation this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a clear demonstration of our global human interconnection and the responsibilities we have toward each other.
Its challenges are unprecedented, but we know that our best response is based on the type of empathy, cooperation and community-building at the global level that is at the heart of this organization.
The fellowship and kindness we have observed among all our colleagues in e-mails, calls and instant conversations are a remarkable testimony to the incredible human beings with whom we have the chance to work.
I could no longer be grateful and proud to all count on you among my colleagues.
Last week, someone told me of his gratitude for our work.
This person reminded me of how important it is for the world to be able to consult Wikipedia at present, and the strong symbol that this essential resource remains online and accessible to all.
This is possible thanks to your work, whether you maintain operational sites, ensure the payment of our colleagues or the security of our communities.
The world needs information provided by Wikipedia, now more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do but also how we do it will have a significant impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and the role you play there, we will make significant adjustments to the way we work together from next week.
Adjustments to our work and our time jobs
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the team met last night to discuss our approach and our use of time in the days and months to come.
During this conversation, we considered what would be an appropriate response to the situation we are facing and the best way to ensure the sustainability of the organization during this period.
Above all, we wanted to eliminate stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to step back, don't worry.
To all staff, subcontractors and contractors:
our goal of daily working time will be about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week until new order.
We do not declare a holiday: if you are able to ensure more normal working hours, you may be useful to the mission.
However, the world is unpredictable at the moment, and if you need to take care of your loved ones, run or consult a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We're not monitoring your hours.
If you're sick, don't work.
That should go without saying, but we say so.
No sick leave or paid leave required: simply warn your superior and help your team review time schedules and jobs to ensure that the main areas of work are covered.
(If you are diagnosed positive at the COVID-19, please warn Bryan of the T&amp;C Ops department to help you and make sure your situation receives the necessary attention from management).
The hourly staff will be fully paid.
We have already announced this, and we reiterate our commitment to honor our responsibilities to our subcontractors and colleagues in the hourly staff.
Everyone will be paid on the basis of their usual working hours under normal conditions.
It's worth if you're sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a way to evacuate their stress related to the world around us.
What we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in times like this.
Once again, the aim is to preserve you.
We simply ask you to contact your superior so that we know what we expect and can take the necessary steps.
Some tasks are considered essential.
There are certain things we must continue to do.
SRE teams, HR Ops, Trust &Amp; Security and Fund Collection (including others) perform essential work that may require reinforcement.
We will initiate a process with all departments to assess the current objectives and focus on supporting core tasks for our mission.
There is enough work for each of us, we will simply focus on the most essential projects.
Slow down now won't hurt any later.
We do not intend to "work twice more to catch up with the lost time" when the pandemic is over.
We will not ask you to spend extra hours meeting unrealistic deadlines.
We recognize that circumstances have changed, and we will strive to establish new targets and timelines as appropriate.
What about the APP (Annual Planning)?
In order to adapt to our new reality and to the objectives of daily working time, we plan to adjust the timetable for the delivery of our Annual Plan 2020-2021.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan, which provides more time to prepare a budget to allow employees to focus on essential work, care for them and their loved ones while adapting to those who need it or want to see their working hours reduced in the coming weeks.
This extension of deadlines significantly reduces the workload and pressure of current planning throughout the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and inform delegates and teams of the next steps as soon as possible.
Thanks to the APP team for your leadership in this regard.
Situation, exhibition and cleaning of the office
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues based in San Francisco might have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, in excess of caution, we used an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces of the San Francisco office.
They used a hospital quality antiviral solution to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the entrance hall and elevator cages leading to our floor.
The building uses its own due diligence protocol that uses products that ensure the safety of its tenants.
We are convinced that the office will be well prepared when we decide to return.
Our Washington DC office is located in a WeWork site, which shared with us and all staff based in Washington DC its COVID-19 protocol.
Since last week, our Washington DC office has adopted a completely remote configuration in accordance with San Francisco's advice.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we also discussed the idea of renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions continue but could be adjourned.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who are used to remote work are aware that adaptation can be difficult and would like to offer you some advice:
Reduce the duration of meetings to meetings by up to one or two hours.
If longer sessions are necessary, consider distributing them over several days.
Clearly define the meeting, have an agenda and send the documentation in advance.
Making videos the standard, using tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to encourage collaboration and live exchanges.
Have a coordinator to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor the instant conversation and the list of speakers, and someone who helps take notes (or make collective notes).
Send an electronic mail to technical support if you need a comfortable helmet.
Use your wellness refund for snacks.
Join the #remote channel on Slack to talk to your colleagues about the distribution of work
The HR Operations team is studying ergonomic guidelines based on webinaries to support the increase in the distribution of work in the Foundation.
Last week, we asked all beneficiaries of the Community grant to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as edit-a-thons, until the WHO announced the end of the pandemic.
We explained to them that we understand that our requests for cancellation and other restrictions could make it impossible to carry out their agreed grant activities and that no one would be penalized in the event of delay or modification of these objectives.
Next week, we will issue additional guidelines on Wikimania and other thematic and regional community conferences.
The general feeling of the international community seems to be both sad in the face of upheaval and relief in the face of clarity and the possibility of focusing on its own communities, Wikimedia and others.
As for the future, the CRT is working to create a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and continue our communications with them.
Stay in touch despite problems related to COVID-19
We will send an invitation to your calendars for an extraordinary meeting of staff next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will take advantage of this moment to share other updates, answer your questions and spend time together.
This situation affects us all and we are here to help you in any way.
From here you can always find the information contained in this e-mail, as well as all other essential information related to COVID-19, on Office Wiki.
The CRT will update these pages and collect all information at the same location.
We also strive to maintain regular communications with staff living in countries that are currently seriously affected.
If you have questions about travel, events, a significant workflow or coverage difficulties, or if you need help with anything else, do not hesitate to prevent and work with the CRT.
We are here to support and ensure liaison if necessary.
For any confidential or sensitive matter, please send an e-mail to Bryan Judah, Director of International Operations HR.
None of these changes should be considered as a abandonment of our work and our obligations.
On the contrary, it is a matter of recognizing that at present our work and obligations will probably have to adapt in an unprecedented way.
These steps are what we consider necessary to support each other and to be able to continue our work, to provide our movement with the help it needs, and to provide the world with the service that everyone can count on.
Our planned work will be here waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it is time to help and prepare for the important work that will come in the weeks and perhaps in the months to come.
We need each one of you to achieve this, so you must preserve and care for your families in order to give the best of yourself the time to come.
Finally, if you like: wash your hands and don't touch your face!

b'Angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme (ACE2) is an enzyme related to the external face (cellular membranes) of the cells of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney and intestines.
ACE2 against the activity of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing the Ang (1-7) which makes it a promising drug target in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 is also the point of entry into the cells of certain coronary artery.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin 2 converting enzyme is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme located on the surface of endothelial cells and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains an M2 domain of end-of-life peptide N and a field of collectrine transporting renal end-of-life amino acid C.
ACE2 is a single-pass membrane protein of type I, whose enzyme-active domain is exposed to the surface of the cells of the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is cleavaged from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme called sheddase; the resulting soluble protein is released into the blood stream and finally excreted into the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is related to the cell membrane primarily to type II pulmonary alveoli cells, fatty intestine enterocytes, arterial and venous endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells in most organs.
The expression of ACE2's ARNm is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus and the brain stem.
The primary function of ACE2 is to compensate for ACE.
ACE clefts angiotensin I hormone into angiotensin II vasoconstrictor.
ACE2, in turn, phenylamine carboxylated amino acid of angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysis in vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also crack several other peptides including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apeline, neurotensin, dynorphine A, and ghréline.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane circulation of the neutral amino acid carrier SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup's disease.
As a transmembranary protein, ACE2 is the main point of entry into the cells of certain coronary artery viruses, including HCOV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus originating in SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus originating in COVID-19).
Specifically, the binding of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 spiculate S1 protein to the enzyme domain of ACE2 to the cell surface results in endocytosis and translocation of both the virus and enzyme into the internal endosomals.
This entry process also requires the initiation of S protein by the TMPRSS2 host serum protein, the inhibition of TMPRSS2 is currently being investigated as a potential treatment. This leads some to believe that the reduction in ACE2 levels in cells can help fight infection.
However, several professional companies and regulatory bodies have recommended continuing standard treatment using ACE and ARB inhibitors.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 showed that "the use of ACE inhibitors has been associated with a significant reduction of 34% of the risk of pneumonia compared to witness subjects."
In addition, "the risk of pneumonia has also been reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitor who presented a higher risk of pneumonia, especially those who have stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors has also been associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less probative than for the overall risk of pneumonia."
The recombinant human angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (rhACE2) is presented as innovative treatment of severe lung lesions and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with acute respiratory distress syndrome induced by lipopolysaccharide.
The half-life of RhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the duration of action is 30 minutes in addition to the duration of 24 hours of effect.
Several conclusions suggest that rhACE2 could be a promising medicine for people intolerant to classical kidney-angiotensin (RAS) inhibitors or for diseases with a high flow of angiotensin II. RhACE2 infusion has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
COVID-19 applications are mobile applications designed to facilitate contact tracing in the context of the 2019-20 Coronavirus pandemic, i.e. identification of persons ("contacts") that may be contacted with an infected individual.
Various applications have been developed or proposed, with official government support in certain territories and in some jurisdictions.
Several infrastructure has been developed for the design of contact tracing applications.
These systems, particularly those based on tracing the geographical location of application users, raise privacy issues.
There are other less intrusive options, including the use of Bluetooth signals to record the proximity of a user with other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced the direct integration into their Android and iOS operating systems of a functionality to support these Bluetooth applications.
The Chinese government, in partnership with Alipay, has deployed an application in China that allows citizens to verify whether they have been in contact with people with COVID-19.
It is used in over 200 Chinese cities. Singapore has opted for an application called TraceTogether.
Developed by a local computer community, it has been provided as an open source and will be delivered to the government. North Macedonia has launched "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth application that ensures the tracking of exposure to potentially infected people and quickly communicating with health authorities.
The application was developed by the Department of Communications and Technologies and the Department of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting approval by the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government stated that the application of contact tracing was at an advanced stage of development and could be deployed in the coming weeks. A similar application is expected in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are considering setting up applications on TraceTogether's model in Singapore and on the basis of the BlueTrace protocol. Russia wishes to introduce a georepeating application for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and residing in Moscow to ensure that they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, raised several possible practical problems related to the use of application-based systems, including false positives and lack of potential effectiveness if only a small part of the population uses the application.
In response to concerns about the spread of malicious or harmful "coronavirus" applications, Apple only allows "official" or generally reliable organizations to add coronavirus applications to the App Store.
Google and Amazon have applied similar restrictions.
Activists for the protection of privacy expressed concerns about the implications of coronavirus applications for mass surveillance, in particular the possible dismantling of the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the Coronavirus pandemic once the threat has been removed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for the limitation of such monitoring.
These organizations set out eight conditions to be met in government projects:
supervision should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
the extensions of control and surveillance should include extinguishing clauses;
the use of data should be limited to the objectives of combating COVID-19;
data security and anonymity should be clearly protected;
Digital surveillance should ensure that discrimination and marginalization are not exacerbated;
any data sharing with third parties should be defined in the law;
protection against abuse and remedies should be provided for citizens in the event of abuse;
The "significant participation" of all "stakeholder stakeholders" would be mandatory, including that of public health experts and marginalized groups. Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Report one Grenzen) (RSF) in Germany also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to address the problem of the persistence of surveillance by removing the mechanism for tracing the operating system of their devices as soon as it is no longer necessary.
Some countries have used a network geolocation system instead of applications, which eliminates both the need to download an application and the ability to avoid tracing.
In Israel, network tracing was approved.
Network solutions with access to gross geolocation data present important potential privacy issues.
However, all systems based on central servers do not need access to personal location data; several systems have been created to use central servers only for intercommunication, which allows privacy to be respected (see next section).
In South Korea, a non-application-based system was used for contact tracing.
Instead of using a dedicated application, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including data from mobile devices and card transactions, which they then associated with in order to send SMS warnings to potentially infected persons.
In addition to the use of this information to warn potential contacts, the government has also made location information accessible to the public, which was authorized as a result of the profound changes made to privacy laws after the MERS epidemic that affected that country.
This information is accessible to the public through several applications and websites. Countries such as Germany have considered the use of centralized privacy systems.
The details had not yet been disclosed on 6 April 2020.
The privacy tracking of contacts is a well-established concept, supported by a large volume of research data as of April 7, 2020. On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups worked on privacy solutions, including using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to record the proximity of a user with other mobile phones.
However, the PEPP-PT project is a coordinating effort that combines centralized and decentralized approaches and does not constitute a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, formerly appointed Contact Event Numbers, CEN), Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracing (PACT), among others.
These protocols ensure that identifiable personal data never leaves the device and that all correspondences are made on the device.
The Privacy Group of the MIT Media Lab is currently developing SafePaths, a platform for the use of privacy preservation techniques when collecting and using localization or contact data to monitor the spread of COVID-19.
This technique is based on the results of the White Paper "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" published in March 2020. The SafeTrace platform of Enigma MPC, a company developing privacy technologies originally based on the MIT Media Lab, is another similar effort.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive localization and health data with other users and authorities, without compromising their confidentiality.
On 5 April 2020, the TCN International Coalition was founded by groups gathered around a common approach and essentially equivalent protocols in order to reduce fragmentation and ensure the global interoperability of tracing and alert applications, an essential factor in their adoption by a wide public.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced the release of the source code of the BlueTrace protocol used by its official application.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, which control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a contact tracking initiative, stating that it would preserve privacy and associate Bluetooth Low Energy technology and a privacy encryption.
They also published the specifications of the basic technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three phases:
deployment of tools to enable governments to create official privacy-respective coronavirus tracing applications
Direct integration of this feature into iOS and Android. Google and Apple plan to solve problems of adoption of the solution and persistence of surveillance by initially distributing the system through updates of the operating system and subsequently removing it in the same way after the remote threat.
The repositioning of a drug (also called reorientation, reprofiling, reassignment or change of therapeutic indication of a drug) means the conversion of an approved drug for a disease or for a medical condition different from that for which it was originally developed.
This is a scientific research axis currently being studied to develop safe and effective treatments against COVID-19.
Other research axes include the development of a vaccine against VOCID-19 and the plasma transfusion of convalescent individuals. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 therapeutic target proteins, each of which has several ligand binding sites.
The analysis of these liaison sites offers the realistic project for the development of an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important target proteins in SARS-CoV-2 are papaine-type protease, dependent NRA polymerase, helicase, protein S, and ADP ribose phosphate.
Hussein A, et al. studied several candidate compounds that they then optimized and analyzed to determine their structural similarity with the most similar approved drugs to accelerate the development of a powerful anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in their preclinical study to recommend in the design of a clinical study.
Chloroquine is also an anti-paludean drug used against certain autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs studied in the Solidarity clinical trial.
The Governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, announced that the New York State trials on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulphate and chloroquine phosphate under an emergency authorisation (USA).
Treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorised under the U.S. only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in patients hospitalized but unable to receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC stated that "the use, dosage or duration of administration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-COV-2 infection" has not yet been established.
Physicians have indicated that they use this medicine "when there is no other option".
A Turkish research team in Istanbul conducts a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Broader studies are under way at Duke University and Oxford University.
The NYU Langone Medical School carries out a test on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials conducted in Wuhan and Shenzhen stated that favipiravir was "clearly effective."
35 patients in Shenzhen were tested negative within an average of 4 days while the duration of the disease was 11 days in the 45 patients who had not received it.
In a study in Wuhan of 240 patients with pneumonia, half received favipiravir and the other half received imefenovir.
The Italian Medicines Agency reminded the public that the existing evidence for the drug is thin and preliminary.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would purchase the medicine in Japan for its reservations and that it would use the army to deliver the medication to university hospitals where the medication would be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has opened up opportunities for Trump administration to acquire the drug. The drug may be less effective in serious cases of the disease where the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or those who are trying to procreate.
A study on lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), an association of lopinavir and ritonavir antivirals, concluded "that no benefit was observed".
These drugs were designed to inhibit HIV replication by linking to protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify these drugs to find a compound that would link with the protease of SARS-CoV-2. There are criticisms in the scientific community about the use of resources for the repositioning of drugs specially developed for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity trial.
Redesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as treatment for Ebola virus and Marburg viral infections. Gilead Sciences then discovered that redesivir had in vitro antiviral activity against several phyloviruses, pneumoviruses, paramyxoviruses and coronary virus.
An antiviral treatment problem is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more severe disease and transmission.
Some early studies before the trial suggest that redesivir may have a high genetic barrier against resistance. Several clinical trials are ongoing, including two conducted by Cleveland university hospitals; one dealing with people with moderate pathology and the other on those with more severe forms.
There are three ongoing clinical trials on intravenous vitamin C for people who are hospitalized and seriously ill with COVID-19; two controlled against plasibo (China and Canada) and one without control (Italy).
New York State began testing for azithromycin antibiotics on March 24, 2020.
The Japanese National Centre for Health and Global Medicine (NCGM) provides a clinical trial on Teijin's alvesco (cyclesonide), a corticosteroid for inhalation used for asthma, for the treatment of presymptomatic patients infected with the new coronary artery.
A form of angiotensin 2 converting enzyme, a phase II test is ongoing with 200 patients to be recruited from severe cases hospitalized in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the efficacy of treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients with moderate COVID-19 symptoms.
The study called COLCORONA recruits 6,000 adults over 40 years of age who have been diagnosed positive at COVID-19 and have moderate symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Pregnant or breastfeeding women who do not have an effective method of contraception are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, which encourages the Italian drug agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multicentre study of 300 patients and studying the use of enoxaparin sodium in preventive and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy on 14 April.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, a large number of researchers have focused on the repositioning of approved antiviral drugs that have been developed for previous epidemics such as MERS, SARS and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: Humifenovir has been recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Some antibiotics have been identified as potentially repositionable as COVID-19 treatments:
tocilizumab (anti-IL-6 receiver): approved by China.
Trials are also under way in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetic vaccine against 2019 coronary artery disease (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has passed clinical tests, many developmental attempts are under way.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that no vaccine was expected against SARS-CoV-2, a virus causing the disease, before at least 18 months.
In April, five vaccine candidates were under phase I safety study.
The COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major epidemic was reported worldwide in 2020, resulting in significant investments and research to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
As defined in April, the requirements of the CEPI initiative for the development of a vaccine include speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists indicated that 10 different technology platforms were conducting research and development projects beginning in 2020 with the aim of creating an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Targets of the main platform in phase I safety studies include:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (phase I developer and candidate vaccine: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral vector (phase I developer and candidate vaccine: CanSino Biologicals, adenoviral vector type 5)
As the CEPI scientists stated in April, 115 total vaccine candidates are at the first stages of development of which 78 (79 according to Milken Institute) confirmed as active and 37 other announcements, but with little public information available (presumed during planning or design).
A phase I-II test conducts preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests, is usually randomised, controlled against plasibo and carried out in several centers all by determining more accurate effective doses.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including a control group, and test the effectiveness of the vaccine in disease prevention, while monitoring the adverse effects at the optimal dose.
Of the 79 active development vaccine candidates (confirmed early April 2020), 74 were not yet in the human assessment phase (always in "preclinical" research).
Around 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was studying the potential of a molecular clamp vaccine that would genetically alter viral proteins to stimulate an immune reaction.

in the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
The partners also announced preclinical testing projects and a phase I clinical trial for July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that they were working on 11 isolates and that even in accelerated procedures, it would take about a year and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec, Quebec, reported developing a coronavirus-like particle through partial funding from Canadian health research institutes.
The vaccine candidate is currently being researched in the laboratory, with human testing scheduled for July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, the Guardian announced that U.S. President Donald Trump had offered CureVac "strong amounts of money to benefit from exclusive access to the vaccine against COVID-19," which led to the protest of the German government.
On March 17, 2020, the U.S. pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech for the joint development of an ARN-based vaccine.
The BNT162 RNA vaccine candidate is currently undergoing a preclinical test with the beginning of the clinical trials expected in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020 in Italy, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it would have preclinical test results in April 2020 and that the man test of its final vaccine candidate could begin in the fall.
In France, on 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) announced an investment of $4.9 million in a consortium for the search for a vaccine against COVID-19 including the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, thus bringing the total investment of CEPI in the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 to US$29 million.
The other ECI investment partners for the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, Oxford University and Queensland University.
On 20 March 2020, the Russian health authorities announced that scientists had started animal testing of six different vaccine candidates.
Imperial College London researchers announced on March 20, 2020 that they are developing a self-amplifying RNA vaccine against COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days after China sent the sequence.
At the end of March, the Canadian government announced funding of $275 million for 96 medical countermeasures research projects against COVID-19, including several candidate vaccines in Canadian companies and universities such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
At approximately the same time, the Canadian government announced the allocation of $ 192 million C dedicated to the development of a VOCID-19 vaccine with projects to create a national "vaccination bank" containing several new vaccines that can be used if other coronavirus epidemics occur.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at Pittsburgh University of Medicine indicated that PittCoVacc, a potential vaccine against COVID-19 in mice, asserting that "the subunits of vaccines SARS-CoV-2 S1 administered by micro needles triggered an important response from the specific antibodies of the antigen [in mice] observed 2 weeks after immunization."
In Canada, on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo Pharmacy School announced the design of a DNA-based vaccine candidate in the potential form of a nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be designed to replicate in human bacteria to produce harmless particles similar to virus particles that could stimulate the production of antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus by the immune system.
In March 2020, the US government, industry and three universities pooled their resources to access IBM supercomputers, associated with cloud-hosted IT resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterogeneous effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can offer benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
Another randomized trial in Australia plans to include 4,170 health professionals.
Vaccines may not be safe or effective.
Initial research to assess the effectiveness of a vaccine using COVID-19-specific animal models, such as transgenic ACE-2 mice, other laboratory animals, non-human primates, indicates a need to implement level 3 biosecurity containment measures for the handling of live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS were tested on non-human animal models.
In 2020, there was no curative or protective vaccine against SARS that demonstrated both its safety and its efficacy in humans.
According to research documents published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicines to treat SARS were a priority for governments and health agencies around the world.There is no proven vaccine against MERS.
When MERS expanded, it was thought that existing SARS research could serve as a model for the development of vaccines and medicines against MERS-CoV infection.
In March 2020, only one vaccine against MERS (based on DNA) had completed phase I clinical trials in humans and three others were ongoing; all vaccines were viral vector, two adenoviral vector (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Publications on social networks have disseminated a conspiracy theory that the virus at the origin of COVID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
Patents cited by different social network publications refer to existing patents dealing with genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of coronavirus such as SARS coronavirus.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by coronavirus 2 related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, sore throat, loss of taste and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it may vary between two and fourteen days.
While most cases cause moderate symptoms, some develop towards viral pneumonia and failure of several organs.
On 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases were reported worldwide in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568 000 people have been cured. The virus mainly spread during close contact, often by droplets produced by coughing, sneezing or talking.
As these droplets are produced at expiration, they usually fall to the ground or on surfaces rather than represent an infectious risk over long distances.
People may also be infected by touching a contaminated surface, then by touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces up to 72 hours.
It is the most contagious in the first three days following the onset of symptoms, although the contagion is possible prior to the onset of symptoms and during subsequent phases of the disease. The standard test method uses the reverse transcription of the polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The use of masks is recommended for those who think they are infected by the virus and their caregivers.
Recommendations on wearing masks by the public generally vary, some authorities discourage their use, others recommend their use, and others impose their use.
There is currently no specific antiviral vaccine or treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries of the six regions of WHO.
People infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or develop flu symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, exhaustion.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, pain or persistent chest pressure, confusion, difficulty walking and face or blue lips; in the presence of these symptoms it is advisable to consult a doctor immediately.
Less frequently, upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, nasal flow, or sore throat may be observed.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea have been observed in various proportions.
Some cases in China initially presented only chest pressure and palpitations.
In some, the disease can cause pneumonia, failure of several organs and death.
That's what the incubation period is called.
The incubation period of the COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but may range up to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that all people infected will not develop symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in transmission is not yet fully known, but preliminary elements suggest that they could contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected people who do not have symptoms is currently unknown and under study. Korean disease prevention and control centres (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during hospitalization.
The Chinese National Health Commission began to include asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on April 1st; out of 166 infections found today, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of the test.
The expectoration and saliva can both carry significant viral loads.
Strong speech releases more droplets than normal speech.
A study in Singapore revealed that unprotected coughing can project droplets at a distance of 4.5 metres (15 feet).
Although the virus is generally not airborne, the National Academy of Sciences suggested that bioaerosol transmission could be possible and that air collectors located outside the patient's chambers produced positive samples of viral RNA.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (PRC) may disperse respiratory secretions and thus lead to air propagation.
Although there are concerns about the propagation by the saddles, this risk is perceived as weak. The virus is the most contagious when people show symptoms; although propagation may be possible before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that if it is not yet known exactly how easy the disease is spreading, a person in general contaminates two to three others. The virus survives hours or even days on the surface.
Precisely, the virus was detected at the end of one day on cardboard, three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and four hours on copper at 99%.
However, this varies according to humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergents are also effective if used properly; soap based products degrade the protective lipid layer of the virus, which deactivates it and eliminates the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant) are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken on average two days after the start of hospitalization.
In five out of six patients, the first sample revealed the highest viral load, while in the sixth patient the highest viral load was on the second day tested.
Coronavirus 2 related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new coronary artery responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome, initially isolated in three people with pneumonia related to the home of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in the related coronaviruses in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which breaks its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is a close relative of the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most affected organs by COVID-19 because the virus reaches host cells through angiotensin 2 (ACE2) converting enzyme, which is the most abundant in alveolar cells type II of the lungs.
The virus uses a specific surface glycoprotein called "spicle" (peplomer) to bind to ACE 2 and enter the host cell.
Acute heart injuries were reported in 12% of people admitted to Wuhan hospital in China, and are more frequent when the disease is more severe.
Cardiovascular symptoms are high due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, however acute myocardial lesions may also be related to ACE 2 receptors in the heart.
ACE 2 receptors are strongly expressed in the heart and in the cardiac functions involved.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolic disease (25%) was observed in patients in intensive care units with COVID-19 infections and may be associated with an unfavorable prognosis. Autopsies of deceased people from COVID-19 showed widespread alveolar damage (ADD) and inflammatory infiltrates containing lymphocytes in the lung.
Although SARS-COV-2 presents a tropism for epithelial cells in the airways that express ACE-2, patients with severe COVID-19 have systemic hyperinflammation symptoms.
In particular, GM-CSF secretive T cells have been associated with the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes secreting IL6 and severe pulmonary pathology of patients with IOCID-19.
Lymphocyte infiltrates were also reported in the autopsy.
WHO has published several test protocols for the disease.
The standard test method uses the reverse transcription of the polymerase chain reaction in real time (rRT-PCR).
The test is generally performed on respiratory samples obtained by rhinopharyngous sampling; however, a nasal or expectoration sampling may also be used.
Generally, the results are available in a few hours, or up to two days.
Blood tests can also be used, however they require two blood samples taken two weeks apart and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists have been able to isolate a strain of coronavirus and have published the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world have been able to independently develop chain polymerization reaction tests (PCRs) to detect virus infection.
On April 4, 2020, antibody tests (probably to detect active infections and previous infection of a person) were under development, but not yet widely used.
The Chinese test experience revealed a accuracy of only 60% to 70%.
The FDA in the United States approved the first test closest to the patient on March 21, 2020 to be used at the end of this month. Diagnostic guidelines published by Zhongnan Hospital at Wuhan University suggest methods for detecting infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Multi-lobary glass opaciities with peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution are typical symptoms visible at the beginning of the infection.
Dominance under pleural, crazy paving (interlobular septal thickening with variable alveolar padding) and consolidation may occur with the progression of the disease.
Few data are available on microscopic lesions and on the pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings in autopsy are:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary oedema
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia may be observed:
moderate pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pulmonary hyperplasia, extended atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and formation of multinucleated giant cells
Severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (ADD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (RASD) and severe hypoxaemia.
Pneumonia in the process of healing: organization of exudates in alveolar cavities and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (CIVD); leuko-erythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding hot spots, frequent washing of hands in water and soap for at least 20 seconds, good respiratory hygiene and avoiding eye, nose or mouth touching with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a handkerchief when coughing or sneezing and using the inside of the elbow in the absence of a handkerchief.
Proper hand hygiene after coughing or sneezing is recommended.
The CDC recommended covering its face using tissue in public places to limit transmission in case of asymptomatic individuals. Social distancing strategies aim to reduce contact of infected people with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, reducing travel and reversing large groups of people.
Distance directives also include a minimum distance of 6 feet (1.8 m) between persons.
There is no known drug to be effective in preventing COVID-19. Since a vaccine is not expected before 2021 at the earliest, a key element of the management of COVID-19 is to try to reduce the epidemic peak, which is also called "plating the curve".
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands often in soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after they have been in the toilet or when their hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after having been soaked, coughed, or sneezed.
It also recommends using a disinfectant solution for alcohol-based hands containing at least 60% alcohol, but only if water and soap are not available. For areas where trade-based disinfectants are not available, WHO proposes two formulas for local production.
In these formulas, antimicrobial activity comes from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol, it is not "an antiseptic active substance for hands".
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
People are treated with support care that may include water treatment, oxygen therapy and support from other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that people suspected of wearing the virus wear a simple facial mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to treat cases of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still analysed.
Personal hygiene, a healthy lifestyle and diet have been recommended to promote immunity.
Support treatments can be useful in those with moderate symptoms at the early stage of infection. WHO and the National Health Commission have issued recommendations for the care of people hospitalized for COVID-19.
Revitalizing doctors and pneumologists in the United States have collected therapeutic recommendations from several agencies in a free resource, the CIBC.
In April 2020, there was no specific treatment of COVID-19.
With regard to symptoms, some health professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophene) rather than ibuprofen in the front line.
Caution should be exercised to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in conditions of care where procedures may generate aerosols, such as intubation or manual ventilation.
The CDC recommends placing the person in an isolation chamber adapted to air infection (AIIR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions, and air transmission precautions. The CDC highlights the guidelines for the use of individual protection equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is: PPE blouse, respiratory or facial mask, eye protection and medical gloves. If available, respiratory masks are preferred (to facial masks).
The N95 respiratory masks are approved under industrial conditions, but the FDA has authorized the use of these masks under an emergency authorisation (USA).
They are designed to protect air particles such as dust, but their effectiveness against specific biological agents is not guaranteed for uses not indicated.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends using facial protection screens, or last resort, artisanal masks.
The majority of COVID-19 cases are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or other alternatives, but a certain percentage of cases are.
The type of respiratory assistance for people with respiratory failure related to COVID-19 is actively studied for hospitalized people. Some evidence indicates that intubation can be avoided using a high-speed nasal canal or positive pressure of double-level airways.
It is not known whether either or both generate the same benefits for people in a critical state.
Some doctors prefer to use invasive mechanical ventilation when it is available because this technique limits the diffusion of aerosol particles compared to a high-speed nasal canal. Serious cases are more frequent in older adults (over 60 years of age, especially those over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per person, which limits the ability of the care system to treat a sudden peak of the number of cases of COVID-19 sufficiently severe to require hospitalization.
A study in China showed that 5% of cases were admitted to intensive care, 2.3% needed respiratory assistance and 1.4% died.
In China, approximately 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are finally admitted to intensive care.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) during COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes more difficult.
Ventilation devices offering pressure control modes and a high PEEP are necessary to optimize oxygen delivery and minimize the risk of pulmonary injury associated with ventilation and pneumothorax.
High PEEP may not be available on older ventilation devices.
The search for potential treatments to be started in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are subject to clinical trials.
Redesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new drugs may not be developed before 2021, several drugs are already approved in other indications and tests are already advanced.
Antiviral medicine may be tested in people with severe disease.
WHO recommended that volunteers participate in trials on the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments. The FDA granted temporary permission to plasma of convalescent individuals as experimental treatment in cases where the person's life is seriously or immediately threatened.
It has not been submitted to the clinical trials necessary to demonstrate its safety and efficacy for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to manage the epidemic.
Users are asked to enter their name and an identifier.
The application is able to detect "near contacts" using surveillance data and therefore detect a potential risk of infection.
Each user can also control the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the application does not only recommend self- quarantine, it also alerts local health authorities. The analysis of mass data from mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone location and artificial intelligence are used to locate infected people and people with whom they have been in contact in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Government of Israel allowed security agencies to locate the mobile phone data of persons suspected of having the coronavirus.
The purpose of the measure was to enforce quarantine and protect those who might have been in contact with infected citizens.
In March 2020 too, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregate telephone location data with the German federal government agency, Robert Koch Institute, in order to analyze and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has deployed facial recognition technology to detect people who do not respect quarantine.
In Italy, regional health minister Giulio Gallera said he was informed by mobile operators that "40 per cent of people continue to move".
The German government conducted a 48-hour hackathon weekend with more than 42,000 participants.
Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid has launched a global appeal to find creative solutions to prevent the spread of coronavirus.
People may suffer from quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of infection themselves.
The BBC cited Rory O'Connor as saying, "increasing social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic recession are a perfect cocktail to damage people's mental health and well-being."
The disease may have moderate development with little or no symptoms, similar to other common respiratory diseases such as cold.
Moderate cases usually recover within two weeks, while severe or critical cases require three to six weeks.
Pregnant women may have a higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection based on similar virus data, such as SARS and MERS, but there is a lack of data for COVID-19. In some cases, COVID-19 may affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
In the most severely affected cases, COVID-19 can move rapidly towards acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) causing respiratory failure, septic shock or multivisceral failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include septicaemia, coagulation disorders and cardiac, renal and hepatic lesions.
Coagulation disorders, in particular increased prothrombin time, were described in 6% of cases hospitalized with COVID-19, with renal impairment observed in 4% of patients in this group.
Approximately 20 to 30% of people with VOCID-19 have a high rate of liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between onset of symptoms and death was ten days, including five spent in hospitalization.
However, patients transferred to intensive care had an average duration of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In an early case study, the mean duration between onset of symptoms and death was 14 days, with a total range between six and 41 days.
In a study by the National Commission on Health (NHC), men had a mortality rate of 2.8 per cent while women had a mortality rate of 1.7 per cent.
Histopathological examinations of post-mortem pulmonary samples present widespread alveolar damage with exudated fibromyxoid cells in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were observed in pneumocytes.
The image of the lung is similar to an acute respiratory distress syndrome (RASD).
At 11.8% of deaths reported by the Chinese National Health Commission, heart injuries due to high troponin rates or cardiac arrest have been observed.
According to March data from the United States, 89 per cent of hospitalized persons had pre-existing conditions. The availability of medical resources and socio-economic conditions in a region may also have an impact on mortality.
Estimates of the mortality rate of the disease vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
Sub-numbering of moderate cases may result in overestimation of mortality rates.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of previously contracted cases may indicate that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to develop severe symptoms of COVID-19 and presented a 2.4 times higher risk of intensive care or death compared to non-smokers. Concerns were also found in relation to long-term sequelae of the disease.
The hospital administration in Hong Kong has seen a drop of 20% to 30% of respiratory capacity in certain people cured of the disease, and pulmonary scanners suggest organic lesions.
This can also lead to after-healing after intensive post-care syndrome.
In March 2020, it was unknown whether an earlier infection had effective long-term immunity in people cured of the disease.
Immunity is considered likely based on the behaviour of other coronaviruses, but cases of COVID-19 cures followed by positive coronavirus tests at a later date have been reported.
These cases are considered an aggravating latent infection rather than a reinfection.
It is believed that the virus is natural and of animal origin, by the spread of the infection.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but in December 2019 the spread of the infection was almost exclusively carried out by a human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed COVID-19 cases published in The Lancet in January 2020 revealed that the oldest date of onset of symptoms dates back to December 1, 2019.
Official WHO publications indicated the first onset of symptoms on December 8, 2019.
Several measures are generally used to assess mortality.
These figures vary according to regions and time, and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, therapeutic options, the time elapsed since the beginning of the epidemic, as well as demographic characteristics such as age, sex and health status.
At the end of 2019, WHO has affected the emergency pathological codes CIM-10 U07.1 for confirmed laboratory deaths of SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 for COVID-19 deaths diagnosed from a clinical or epidemiological point of view without laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The death/cas report reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a given time interval.
According to Johns-Hopkins University statistics, the death/world case ratio is 6.9 per cent (153,822/2 240 191) as at 17 April 2020.
This number varies by region. Other measures include the lethality rate (CFR) which reflects the percentage of diagnosed individuals who die from the disease and the infectious lethality rate (IRF) which reflects the percentage of infected persons (diagnosed or not) who die from a disease.
These statistics are not limited over time and follow a specific population of contamination at the end of the disease.
Although all infected persons do not develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies may indicate the number of people who have been infected.
In the epicenter of the epidemic in Italy, in Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 inhabitants, 80 of them (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease spread through festivals, and to young people, resulting in a relatively low mortality rate, and all deaths related to COVID-19 may not have been officially classified as such.
Moreover, the German health system has not been overrun.
In the Netherlands, approximately 3% of people may have antibodies, based on a blood donor assessment.
69 deaths (0.004% of the population) were confirmed as related to COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the mortality rate are different in men and women.
Human mortality is higher in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The risk is highest among 50-year-old men, the difference between men and women who only disappear at 90 years of age.
In China, the death rate was 2.8 per cent in men and 1.7 per cent in women.
The specific reasons for this gender difference are unknown, but genetics and behavioural factors could be part of it.
Immunological differences according to sex, lower prevalence of smoking in women and development in men of comorbidities such as hypertension at a younger age than in women may have contributed to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57 per cent of infected individuals were men and 72% of those who died in the COVID-19 were men.
In April 2020, the U.S. government did not collect data associated with the type of COVID-19 infections.
Studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of health personnel, especially nurses, are women and are at increased risk of being exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19".
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO means crown, VI means virus and D means disease, 19 being the first identification of the epidemic: 31 December 2019.
This name has been chosen to avoid references to a specific geographic location (e.g. China), an animal species or a group of persons, in accordance with international recommendations for nomenclature to prevent stigmatization. The virus causing COVID-19 is called coronavirus 2 related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 virus" in its public communication.
The disease and virus are both commonly referred to as "coronavirus".
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were often called "coronavirus" and "coronavirus of Wuhan".
In January 2020, WHO recommended using the 2019-nCov provisional disease names and acute respiratory disease 2019-nCoV for virus and disease, in accordance with the 2015 Directive against the use of sites in the names of diseases and viruses.
Official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published on February 11, 2020.
Given the capacity limits of standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers print care materials such as buckets and breathing parts.
For example, when an Italian hospital needed an emergency respirator valve and the supplier could not supply it in time, a local startup retro-constructed and printed the 100 valves required in one night.
Following the initial COVID-19 epidemic, conspiracy theories, misinformation and misinformation emerged about the origin, extent, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease and quickly spread online.
It seems that man is able to spread the disease to some other animals.
Studies have failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No medication or vaccine is approved to treat the disease.
International research on vaccines and drugs against COVID-19 is currently conducted by government organizations, academic groups and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched "SOLIDARITY Test" to assess the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the most promising efficacy.
There is no vaccine available, but several agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is used as SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both use the ACE 2 receptor to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being researched.
First, researchers are trying to create a whole virus vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is intended to cause a rapid immune response of the human body in the event of new infection with COVID-19.
A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain virus subunits.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, these studies focus on speculate S protein that helps the virus infiltrate the ACE 2 enzyme receptor.
A third strategy is that of nucleic acid vaccines (dNA or RNA vaccination, a new vaccination creation technique).
Experimental vaccines from all these strategies should be tested in terms of safety and efficacy. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine started with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains an harmless genetic code copied on the virus that causes the disease. Antibody-dependent activation was suggested as a potential challenge in the development of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, but it is controversial.
In April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are underway.
Seven trials have evaluated approved malaria treatments, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Reconverted antiviral drugs constitute the majority of Chinese research, with nine phase III clinical trials on redesivir in several countries that are expected to report at the end of April.
A dynamic clinical development analysis of vaccines and drugs against COVID-19 was also in place in April 2020. Several existing antiviral drugs are evaluated in the treatment of COVID-19, including redesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir associated with beta interferon.
Provisional data suggest the effectiveness of redesivir in March 2020.
Clinical improvements have been observed in patients treated with remedesivir for compassionate use.
Phase III clinical trials are ongoing in the United States, China and Italy. Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, some demand an independent analysis of the research work.
Chinese and Korean health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Virology Institute, while recommending a daily dose of one gram, indicates that double this dose is highly dangerous and could be lethal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine by virtue of an emergency use authorisation at the discretion of physicians treating patients at COVID-19. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes interferon, ribavirin or iodine against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are necessary to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended for further in vivo study after demonstrating a low concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that initial spicle protein starting with serum 2 transmembrane protein (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 via interaction with the ACE 2 receptor.
Studies on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have major limits that have prevented the medical community from adopting these treatments without further studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokinic shock can be a complication at later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have cytokinic shock properties. Tocilizumab was included in the treatment guidelines by the Chinese National Health Commission after a small study was conducted.
Phase 2 testing is ongoing at national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with a severe form of disease.
Associated with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokinic shock, it must counteract such developments that are suspected to cause the death of certain affected persons.
The interleukine-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA on the basis of retrospective case studies for the treatment of refractory cytokine relaxation syndrome to steroids induced by a different cause, CAR T cells treatment in 2017.
To date, there is no randomised and controlled evidence indicating that tocilizumab is an effective treatment of the SCR.
The transfer of concentrated and purified antibodies produced by immune systems of people who have cured VOCID-19 to people who need them is being studied as a non-vaccination method of passive immunization.
This strategy has been tested for SARS with few conclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mode of action through which passive antibody treatment can generate a defense against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibiotic treatment, e.g. using monoclonal antibodies manufactured, are being developed.
The production of serum of convalescent people, consisting of the liquid part of the blood of cured patients and containing specific antibodies against this virus, could be increased for faster deployment.
Coronavirus disease, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan central hospital, who then contracted the COVID-19 and died after drawing attention to the spread of the virus.
