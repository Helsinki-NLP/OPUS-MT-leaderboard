Parliament did not support an amendment to free Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian Parliament has today rejected the proposal to repeal the amendment to the section of the Criminal Code condemning opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko.
The amendment would open the door to the exclusion of the Minister, but parliamentarians rejected the proposal to reduce penalties for economic crimes at second reading.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for the alleged signing of a disadvantageous Russian agreement for Ukraine on the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not yet firm, the Court of Appeal has an obligation to review it in December.
Tymoshenko was convinced that this was political revenge of the regime, and even in the West there had been doubts about the impartiality of the court.
The proposal to withdraw paragraph 365 of the Criminal Code condemning the former Prime Minister was supported by 147 members of the vote.
For approval, 226 votes were required.
The victory of Libya
The history of Libyan liberation, or Libyan rebellion, already has its losers.
Muammar el-Gaddafi was buried in a secret place in the desert and without him there is no war anymore.
It remains to be defined who the winner is
As is already the custom in the region, Islamists won the elections, but now it is a question of delucidating whether it is moderate or radical
The National Transitional Council has brought into force the traditional law, the sharia, which we already know in a certain way.
Libya will become a country without crime, because thieves will be cut off their hand.
Women can already be forgotten about emancipation and apostates waiting for their execution and so on.
Instead of the dictator's person, society, composed of warrior tribes, will be united by the Koran.
In Libya there will be an order that we cannot even imagine and that we certainly cannot.
However, our way of life is neither the only nor objectively the best and probably did not fit the Libyans already mentioned.
The truth is that it is no surprise that Islamic fighters will accept grateful help from unfaithful dogs.
The only justification was that, from their point of view, NATO attacks did not lead them by an American general, but great is Allah, whose greatness celebrated after each successful intervention.
When they are looking for winners in Libya, the West is not among them.
We are trapped in a shooting of what Islamists and our politicians are using to get rid of a dictator in the person of a political ally without guarantee of profit.
Following the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not occupy Libya militarily.
In this case, locals do not have a problem expelling "crossers"
But, without occupation, will the oil companies get to do with the white black gold only in good words?
It is quite possible not, but it may be that the West may finally presume to protect human rights.
Whenever the sharia followers don't cross us.
A New Age of Crisis Begins
France and the rest of Europe go hunting the investor seeker
A statistical whirlwind has spread across Europe
Individual States have published their GDP data for Q3.
The Czech economy in the inter-quarter period has stagnated, while France and Germany have grown.
However, today's bond market has broken records.
Investors are no longer only fixed in Italy, but also in Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the Eurozone, Germany, Czech Republic and other European countries have already published their preliminary estimates on economic growth in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by 0.5%, France's by 0.4%
Both countries have made available the data of the second quarter, in Germany it has improved more than expected (increase of 0.3% instead of the expected 0.1%), although in France there was a slight reduction of 0.1% (the original data were talking about stagnation).
The Czech economy grew annually by 1.5% in the third quarter of this year.
However, during the inter-quarterly period, gross domestic product (GDP) has stagnated and according to ČSÚ the trend towards gradual slowdown in economic development growth is shaped.
The results are even worse than the analysts' forecasts.
Main events:
Internationally, the Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter of this year, but four-monthly has stagnated.
In the third quarter, the German economy, according to previous and seasonally recalculated data, grew by 0.5%.
The economy of the Eurozone and also the European Union, between July and September and compared to the previous quarter, grew by 0.2%, which is consistent with the expectations of analysts.
The Greek economy has fallen 5.2% annually.
The interest of their ten-year bonds is 28.45%.
The interest of Italian and Spanish bonds has grown to critical limits.
The problem is also affecting Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc.
The interests of the Czech bonds at 10 years remain at 4 per cent, although in the area the situation is getting worse.
In Germany there are voices saying that the ECB should grant loans at the latest.
Czechs are classified for Eurocopa.
They beat 1:0 and celebrate the ranking with a premium 200 million.
The football team fulfills the most difficult task of the whole season!
In Montenegro, thanks to the excellent Čech and the brilliant gatekeeper Petr Jiráček, victory was given for 1:0.
The Czech team, together with a good dose of luck in the second time, defended fantastically from the attacks of the local team, so that it will not miss the appointment of the European championship.
IHNED.cz followed the development of the party in a thorough reporting.
There was almost no emotion in the first half and a good dose of luck in the second.
The Czech team, thanks to the collapse of the local team towards the end, and also the excellent game of Čech and the heroic Jiráček, won for 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates its pass to the European Championship.
Due to the very proper Czech defence, the Montenegrins did not press until the second half.
The two injured of the party were Damjanovič and Vučinič, which allowed two great occasions to pass.
Moreover, thanks to the great Petr Čech, the Czech eleven will not miss the date of the European Cup, so the national football arks will reach a gratification of approximately 200 million crowns.
Since the first few minutes there has been a good offensive game.
Both teams were only engaged in keeping the lines and played nothing else around the center of the camp.
There was no pressure from local players in the first half, kicks to the other field in defense, just what the Czech defence could avoid.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country's nuclear program.
They formed a human shield.
Several hundred university students formed human shields around nuclear facilities in Iran.
They wish to express their support for their country ' s nuclear programme in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
The students began praying at noon on Tuesday in front of the facilities and then wrote death slogans to the United States and Israel.
Several hundred university students formed on Tuesday in the Iranian city of Isfahan human shields around the nuclear technology centre in which uranium is worked.
They seek to demonstrate their willingness to defend their country's nuclear programme with their own lives.
In a recent report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) noted that Iran, according to all indications, is striving for nuclear weapons.
In Israel there is talk of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
The students began to pray at noon before Isfahan nuclear facilities and then launched death slogans against the United States and Israel.
In the event of an attack, whose objective would be to paralyze the Iranian nuclear programme, it would be achieved, according to Israeli sources, not only the Isfahan plant but also the Natanz facilities, where uranium is enriched.
Daily menu of an obese child: not breakfast and dinner stuffed
Over one third of children aged between 9 and 13 years have overweight problems, where overweight affects 9 per cent of the school population and obesity at 5%.
Most obese children come from families with an unhealthy lifestyle, according to current research.
It again demonstrates the importance of the environment where it grows for a healthy development of the person, as well as the models that serve as a reference.
At the table, obsessive children are fed, for example, of sausages at least twice as often as children of families with normal weight.
For dinner, more than 19% of obese people had eaten fries the day before the analysis, which is linked to the prevention program " Obesity is not a coincidence."
In families of overweight children, there is no custom to practice sports, which applies to most current families, where only 15 per cent of children responded that their parents, at least once a week, find time for physical exercise.
Survey of 900 children
The survey was conducted at the end of last school year and participated in the same nearly 900 children of Basic Education throughout the Czech Republic.
It was already the second edition of the program of "The Obesity of Not a Chance", which supports the General Health Insurance Company and Unilever.
So far, more than 12,000 children have participated in the project from the 4th to the 8th course.
An adequate diet and adequate exercise in the family are determining factors, which significantly decrease the number of children with overweight and even obesity.
"Only half of the children surveyed have responded that they have five daily meals according to the regime: breakfast, lunch, food, snack and dinner, which is one of the basic conditions for a healthy diet," she collects one of the survey results.
No breakfast but with sausage for dinner
Experts warn that, in healthy development, details are also important, which also count, such as having a fixed hour for family breakfast.
In Czechia, however, only 23 per cent of schoolchildren's families breakfast at the same time.
In most families, each one has breakfast alone.
But the worst thing was to find out that 10% of households don't have breakfast.
Breakfast is, however, the basis of a correct daily diet.
The study shows that in families of obese children, healthy fries are consumed more frequently.
Almost all - regardless of weight - drink daily sweet refreshments (70%).
In general, more than 40 per cent of children surveyed do sports, but among their parents, this result is reduced to less than half, only 15 per cent.
Make your diet
The next phase of the study enabled the chosen boys (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to create their own diets from all possible offers according to their tastes and opinions.
"The food preferences of Czech children between 12 and 15 years of age, from the point of view of a healthy diet, are far from ideal."
Among their favorite foods are pasta, meat and sweets
"It is especially alarming the popularity of sweet refreshments," is announced in the final report of the study.
As main food the palm is taken the paste and closely follows the poultry meat.
Practically, children always reject vegetables and taste for fish and vegetables is very low.
Switching to healthy habits
At the same time, the study shows that children are willing to change their eating habits if they receive fair information.
"In the control group of the study participants, who filled out the questionnaire after the completion of the prevention programme " Obesity is not a coincidence", a significant change was given in many cases in favour of the principles of healthy eating," the results of the study point out.
Call attention, for example, to sweet refreshments, where many children would begin to prefer normal and running water.
Children would also more frequently choose poultry meat and fish for main food in the questionnaire and restrict the consumption of sweet food and flour derivatives.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, support the professionals
In the introductory article, How stylists learn, I already complained a little that the initial lessons were already quite loaded.
I had no idea how that would go.
Conferences of three professionals from the branch, how to dress up problematic characters and, in addition, a seminar on how it works in the world of the show.
And it'll get worse.
The closer the final exams are, the more information and practical tasks await us
And even though the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, there is no longer a threader.
We are times we have studied with the director, Alena, (in the course there is no man) about how to dress the woman who does not have a perfect symmetry.
And so is the great majority.
Someone's necky, someone's got a stylized figure without the right curves and someone's overweight.
The stylist must know how to optically smooth wide shoulders, lengthen a neck or recreate the necessary curves
We have been given certain tricks on how to highlight the body of women of the type of Jennifer Lopez, of huge breasts and hips but narrow waist and at the same time not wearing it in too challenging a
If, for example, the difference between the waist and hips is so much that the skirt or trousers do not fit, it is worth sewing at least one piece of extra fabric to fit.
No doubt they will not repent, for the garment that feels perfectly is unattainable.
With a custom skirt you will feel much better than with one that does not stop moving, getting up, dancing in the waist, etc.
The stylized body can be allowed to dress clothes with folds, ornaments, embroidered or flagged.
There are certainly many kinds of diverse information and body information, so I am glad that I have all week to put all this information into my mind.
And even so, I'm afraid with the assigned task, I already have more than enough.
Each participant in the course has been assigned two celebrities, to whom he must design two garments: one for the day and the other for the night.
The current aspect should be taken into account, the fashion style that suits the person in question.
It's been my turn to "dress" Miranda Kerr, maybe you know the Victoria's Secret campaign.
I cry from the inside, for me it is much better than, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has recently fattened a hundred pounds (please take into account the exaggeration), or the young Selena Gómez.
The dresses we have to cut them out of the magazines or search them on the Internet and print them, then elaborate them graphically.
The moodboard, which is called the complete result, also expresses our personal style and our relationship to graphic design.
It is also important to think about the graphic part of stylism.
The stylist, therefore, did not see only physically, but also dealt with, for example, product pages in magazines (specific topics such as trends, pockets, shelters, etc.).
We were told by the designer and designer Mario Kameník.
But all this is by Sunday.
The stylist must have a global vision.
The three guest specialists encouraged the Saturday conference with information about all kinds of bodies.
The designer Honza Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to take advantage of this.
And a good stylist knows how to work with the same garment in different ways.
The variability is, in this case, fundamental.
Thus, such gabardina (or as they say in English, trench-coat) can be dressed classic with cowboys and t-shirt, but it also serves to dress the naked body with heel shoes and photograph it as if it were actually a dress.
Or just pull it up and up your neck to get a completely different image.
"Play with it," he insisted.
What I value most is the following advice: "To start to work, first you need to know all the rules."
"Then you can break them," Jakub said.
Finally, it is clear to me why we memorize all these formulas, which is combined with what, why, if then it turns out that in fashion magazines we find different results.
That doesn't talk about parades.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know that a designer has to have more clothes on the reserve than he wants to photograph.
So, for a fashion story that has ten pages (so, ten outfits), you have to have ready, ready to use, at least fifteen.
And besides the photos the clothes work in combination with other clothes, all of them different from those used in reality.
All of this must be taken into account when designing the outfit.
Honza Pokorný assured us that the image and style assume themselves, in many cases, half the success.
Just look at Madonna, who is not exactly an extraordinary singer, but the image and the marquetin have made her a world star.
In Czechia, for the moment, there is not yet a clear tendency to use the services of the stylists.
Even the famous characters also find it useless (I'm tired of my skills, my physical appearance doesn't matter so much).
And when someone asks us for our services, we must bear in mind that it is very likely that they will tell us a very different size from their real (less).
Then there is only gulgular and find out if the magazines of the heart have already written on the subject, if a certain celebrity has fattened/declined, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario insisted that the designer not only has to focus on fashion, but has to understand outfits.
During your work, you should mainly communicate with the people you saw, so it is essential to be a good psychologist.
He knows how to value people, he doesn't miss, he defends his opinions.
"When a director hires you to classify the garment and complete it with beautiful clothes, you cannot take and throw away everything there was and say, "Hey, what a horror."
"Find at least a couple of things you can think about and recommend that someone put them on," Mario says.
He himself also showed us that everything should fit into the so-called "placovka", that is, the work bag.
This is fixed around the waist and all the necessary tools are held there.
They are objects like scissors, scissors, removepeluses, or indispensable. There are also nylon thread (which serves the designer during the photo session of products such as bags or hats), special lace clamps in front of them, if it is larger (the threads and other type of hooks are not allowed, as they could damage the fabric), or a sewing game.
In order not to stay in passive listening and put something into practice, we have learned to coat the soles of the shoes.
Even during the photo sessions in the study, on a flat surface, the ground could be damaged and much more the outside.
And we did nothing but coating and covering.
We couldn't touch the shoes with the scissors so we wouldn't hurt them by accident.
So I had to be very skilled.
Mario has given me a joy by praising my work without reservation.
The truth is I don't get those skills very well.
This is only a small part of all that we have heard throughout the weekend, in the second part of the course.
I have already realized that dedicating myself to stylism at professional level is not a pink road, but it gives me exactly what people say.
In Need for Speed: The Run competes all over America.
Review
A journey, in principle unoccupied, is complicated because of a series of unwarranted neglects of a routine journey during the morning shift.
To some extent, expectations were met, but that is of no use, if, in reality, nothing extraordinary was meant to be done.
The new delivery, to which The Run is added, aroused great expectations before its premiere.
I promised I'd blow up the old racing saga Need for Speed and, after the show, it appears like a game that shouldn't end up being a genre of action without more.
We are also curious to know how the scenes inserted would look, where the main character comes down from the car and walks through his own foot.
As is usually the case in the NFS series, the results do not vary much in terms of what we expected.
There are races that can be taken as acceptable, but in total computing points are lost due to absurd errors, which have been appearing in the series for years.
It is not actually possible or called errors, but rather the incomprehensible disengagement of programmers.
The adventure starts very well.
You are introduced into a story, whose protagonist, Jack, has certain personal problems; to solve them, you are offered to participate in an illegal race throughout America.
You sit at the wheel on the west coast of San Francisco, and your mission is to get to New York first.
The idea is to offer something interesting.
The route is divided into ten stages and then into more than fifty races.
It follows that each race takes place on a different route and the stages are located in different environments, which are quite diverse and interesting.
Thus, one does not even remotely feel that the game always offers the same thing.
Some of the environments are even pleasant in sight, although the technical level of the graph is equivalent to that of previous deliveries of the series.
Therefore, it is nothing of the other world.
But the walk through the desert, the autumn landscape or the high snowcapped mountains produce a very pleasant visual effect.
In addition, races are diversified from time to time by an atypical element.
So, for example, in the desert you find a sandstorm that decreases visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains you must be careful not to bury a flood.
According to that, each of the races is well developed.
There are only a couple of models, but that's enough.
For a moment, you try to advance a number of required rivals (the normal one in a classic race), then try to earn time (the classic timed duel) and then expect a duel against a single opponent.
In the middle of all this sometimes comes the police, which only makes things even harder.
The novelty is the landscapes outside the car.
Interactive animations are presented when Jack, in most cases, has to escape someone and you have to help him, always pressing the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are far fewer landscapes in the game than could be expected (in particular there are only three).
But the final result is positive, because this element does not become annoying and, in the context already mentioned, it is one of the elements that make the game more interesting.
The driving model follows the footprints of previous episodes.
That means it's no longer a big deal today, but it can't be said to be bad.
If you're looking for a realistic simulation, you can look elsewhere.
But a race designed with a lot of action suits this style of driving, although we can find something better between the games of competition.
So far, everything's in order.
But problems arise after a certain time.
Unlike the correct driving models, this is no longer the case with collisions.
Of games of this type you can't expect it to create deformations and complicated collisions, but in fact before a blow against any object, you can't predict how your car will react, with which not everything is in order.
It is typical that, by making a very tight advance or circulating the car with a normal traffic, there are only slight rocks, but in other almost identical situations, your car ends up making uncontrolled pirouettes.
Or even ends completely destroyed.
Thanks to the reset system, there are no big problems, but it can put you in a bad mood.
The resets are programmed in such a way that, when you suffer an accident or get off the track, the game returns you to the last point of rescue on the track.
However, only five resets are available in each race.
If you consume them all, you have to restart the race from the beginning.
So it's just a help in case something's not going well, but it's not much to trust.
Sometimes, neither the reset helps, only helps to learn the given stage of memory.
A great disadvantage of the game is that the same facts are repeated in different places.
In some curves, for example, you must enter in a specific way; otherwise, they are impossible to take.
Other times you find yourself somewhere "civil" vehicles always with the same configuration, although you are the first, fifth or you arrived five minutes before or after.
This makes you angry above all in situations, when you see that two cars going to meet in opposite directions, your opponent makes no trouble, but when you get there, you have to either turn or slow down.
It is the same when you arrive, because it is programmed that the "surprise" will always happen before your noses.
Opponents also have one more advantage.
During the whole game you will reach places where, regardless of the moment, the same opponent will always advance you in the same place.
This also happens at the end of the game, on a long bridge, which is even more shocking.
Your opponent must arrive before you, at any price.
When it goes ahead of you, it makes it difficult for you to see the cars that come in front of you, so at first you can pry the car.
You can understand the idea of creating a game with maximum doses of suspension and adrenaline, but execution is so apparent that you are sure to be disappointed right away.
And it's a shame, because although the model of the trip is simple, the game is fun and with action, so it's often not possible to follow the detail what happens or where.
And it really doesn't matter, if merit takes the idea with fifty exclusive tracks or the classification in the race so that it doesn't stop boredom, or anything else.
An unusual idea is the change of cars during the races.
You have to be aware of the gas pumps next to the road, because right there you have to switch cars, although in the vast majority of cases you will need what you have.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Sports are suitable for urban areas, American strong cars for straight highways and super-sport exotics for technical driving, for example by mountain roads with curves.
In addition, the main narrative thread also appears a thread of parallel challenges, that is, there are races in specific places that you will know for stories.
Here you will get not only medals, but also points of experience for your profile, which serves both challenges and stories.
At the top level, the driver opens several possibilities, starting with the car and ending with profile funds.
At the same time, an online Autolog function is connected, which compares your results with those of other players and provides other community functions.
One of the most difficult elements to understand is how the last race in history is made.
With the car you reach the subway tunnel (step), where you start running in the dark along the tracks (step).
The speed meter marks you between 150 and 200 km/h (pass) and, suddenly, behind you comes the subway convoy and you are taken in front of you without further.
In the editorial we will certainly have a discussion about this for several days, about whether during the programming of the game none thought even a little or whether the authors really take us for a bunch of fools.
The technical part of the game is nothing extraordinary, but at least the general visual effects result in most pleasant cases, sometimes even superb.
What a pity it is that, in the most tense moments, image quality is reduced and sometimes in a serious way.
This mainly affects accidents where many participants are involved, when continuous image quality is no longer valid.
The audio is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of tastes.
In order to please most of the youth group, the soundtrack belongs to the category "each of his father and his mother", but it can be assumed that no one would buy the game just for his music.
The final feeling of Need for Speed: The Run is therefore quite confusing.
If the game avoided absolutely silly mistakes, we would have trouble claiming that The Run is the best NFS game in recent years.
It gives the feeling that the game is not finished.
The fun is assured, but prepared because the mistakes will hit you in the eyes with the force of some airport reflectors.
The choirs of the Carolina University will participate in the concert "Terciopel Students".
The joint celebration of the International Day of Students and the anniversary of the Revolution of Terciopelo as a musical experience will take place for the third time at the Festival Academic Festival.
During the same period, twenty corals will be presented from secondary and university centres.
The festival revolves around two concerts on 17 November.

Ambassador to the EU, Vicenová:
Czechs have a reputation for negatists and Eurosceptics.
"The Lisbon Treaty has significantly affected the balance between individual institutions"
"I wasn't expecting a war without a barracks."
"It will take five, six years, before the situation settles a little, calms down and the new players get used to their new roles," the Czech ambassador to the EU, Milena Vicenová, began his lecture at the Law School with conviction.
How can we not take seriously its "clear and openly about Europe" motto, which he already said at the first part of his conference, when he managed to describe each body of the EU and its relations with such accuracy and clarity, as it would be the envy of many lecturers at the U. Carolina Law School.
Vice-Nová also weighed the work of the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman van Rompuy:
"The first comes out of criticism, that if it is insulsus, a gray official, able to assume any role, but I must say that he has left everyone bewildered, because he assumes his roles to perfection."
"It is a man who knows how to listen to members of the twenty-seven states, communicate with them and who has a very clear vision of where the EU should go."
The new position of representative of the foreign and security policy is explained by the question: "Who is this EU? What number can I call it?" This is therefore an important step towards the unification and clarification of political union towards States such as China or India.
Nobody wants to ban Olomouc's cheese
Vice-Nová has also taken care of the agenda, followed and followed by the European Council in the near future.
The Czech presidency two years ago was a success.
The Czechs dealt with the emerging economic crisis, resolved the gas crisis and organized a summit for the Eastern Association.
The fall of the government at that time was identified as a very negative aspect, which seriously affected Czechia.
Czech representation in the EU currently has many commitments.
In the words of the ambassador: "a good noise", not only the presidency, but also the financial crisis, which is now being dealt with.
On the other hand, the seven-year budget of the EU must be approved, caused by the current economic situation, which is much more complicated.
If the budget is simpler and more effective, which sectors will have priority, which countries will receive greater support and which countries will receive more support and which less? That is something that will be on the agenda for the next meeting.
The Ambassador also recalled her main slogans, with which she came to Europe: "About Europe clearly".
"The truth is that I don't like ugly abbreviations, strangers, or jargaes that people don't understand."
"How can a citizen understand that in Brussels the cucumbers are not truly made up of curved or round cucumbers, bananas of various sizes or that no one is going to ban Olomouc's cheese?"
It also aims to make more use of the EU's environment and bring more Czech citizens closer to the European institutions.
The Europe of Speeds awaits us
According to the Ambassador, Czechs are known as Eurosceptics and people perceive rather negative aspects than positive ones.
It also regretted the low participation of the Czechs in the European institutions.
The blame lies with many factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivating messages, but also the limited support of the Czechs.
In addition to the success of the Czech presidency, he highlighted the strength and collaboration of the Visegrad Group.
"I believe that when a Polish and a Hungarian come to me and a Slovak comes near me, a French man next to me says, "What, have you already stayed, those of the Visegrad Group?", and it seems that he does no grace."
In the future, the EU, according to Vicenová, is awaiting new tough budgetary policy regulations for the Member States.
It is perceived as something very real of the concept of the two speeds, if not more, in Europe than the new "European Federation".
"We have countries in the Eurozone and countries outside the Eurozone."
"We have the Schengen area and we also have the enhanced cooperation procedure."
"It was said for the first time that only the countries they want and those who don't, they stay away."
"These procedures will increasingly be and will strengthen Europe at both speeds," Vicenová is expected.
In this regard, he also stressed the role of Czech Republic and Herman van Rompuy in the application of the principle that all issues affecting the whole of the EU should be discussed among the Member States, not only among the members of the Eurozone.
Brand story:
The innovative IBM begins its second century existence
If someone was looking for a term that would define IBM's strategy very accurately, the closest one would be "long term".
For the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is perceived as current and, however, has already been a hundred years since its foundation.
The basis of this long-placist character was laid by the first head of the signature, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He has already coined the motto that many of the world's problems have solutions if people are willing to think.
His motto "Think!" became his seal, around which the life of the giant future will be built (it was also the title of an internal magazine that IBM began publishing in 1935).
Watson was also the basis of a carefully raised corporate culture.
"For us, IBM implies a long-term thought, a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM has survived and prospered for a hundred years for that reason, because it remained faithful to its basic principles, but without fearing the changes around it.
That has allowed us, during our first century, to transform technology, business and society.
We hope to thrive even further in our second century," said the current director of Samuel J. Palmisano during his birthday.
A fancy system
Watson, already in the 1930s, was concerned about the care of his employees as the businessman of Ba cheat in Czechia (the employees of IBM were the first U.S. workers who enjoyed paid vacations, insurance, elegant uniforms and a sophisticated pay system that rewarded the best inventors and sellers.
The same long-term sophistication keeps it IBM in relation to the customer.
Already from the beginning the company was able to discover talents (as one of the first global companies to eliminate any kind of discrimination, it could choose without problems).
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy is the current plan of IBM, for which Palmisano will replace it next year a woman: Virginia Rometty.
She's been working for 30 years at IBM, where she's been sales leader, marketing and strategies.
In recent years IBM has participated in the so-called virtual meetings, rain of ideas online, from which infinite future strategies and innovations arise.
It is not surprising that there are ideas left behind, because almost half a million people work in the firm.
An institution with a good reputation
The fixed position in the business provides the company with a strong internal and external image.
"From the beginning, IBM maintained a concept of an institution rather than a technological enterprise," says the economist professor at Harvard Business School and author of the book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that tries to solve business problems for technology users," says George Colony of Forrester Research consultant.
As the company itself says there is a difference between entering into the business and creating a business directly.
IBM - or the "Great Green" - as is known in the United States familiarly because of its logo, has become one of the largest companies in the world in the last 100 years.
It is possibly the most versatile technology company (develops both equipment, programs, infrastructure and services web hosting within a wide range of services, ranging from servers to nanotechnology).
It has the largest number of patents of all US technology companies and five of its employees have received the Nobel Prize.
Its inventions include automatic cashier, payment cards, financial exchange, bar codes and diskettes.
IBM will bill this year $220 billion. This year has become the second technology firm by market capitalization (the first one is Apple), when it first surpassed Microsoft in 1996.
Looking to the Future
Not all products and innovations have just satisfied the taste of customers and the moment (IBM did not bet on its own operating system, OS/2, Prodigy online services or PCjr IBM computers).
"If your business is based on moving forward, it cannot be emotionally settled in the past," recognized Samuel J. Palmisano.
Therefore, IBM has no problem building its bases on other platforms (and also, if they don't work, abandon them).
And that's the difference of competition, Microsoft, which basically stays and falls exclusively with Windows.
Future technology
In terms of sales, IBM is mainly dedicated to services, of which approximately one fifth are programs and another fifth of equipment.
However, even in 1990 the teams represented more than half the share of suppliers.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-performance assets for a total value of $15 billion. During the same period, it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of future technology.
Investments have continued since 2008, when for the first time the modern global financial crisis was manifested.
IBM acts according to the premise of its first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis of 29 increased investment.
It seems that the IBM company has so far been able to cope with the crisis.
The value of IBM’s shares since the beginning of 2008 has increased stratosphereally to 120 per cent, the net profit of the company has continued to increase.
The currency of IBM is to change everything except its value.
So it can be expected that when the next crisis comes, this flexible giant will endure.
History of IBM: from cheese cutter to space flights
The company IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago, being its original name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was adopted in 1924 - originally a brand used in the branches of Canada and South America.
The basis for the birth of IBM arose from the merger of four companies dating back to the 1880s.
It had inventions such as the famous "watch to fix", which allows to control the entry and exit of employees.
The architect of the new company was the businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 also presided over his supervisory board.
Flint put the head of a competition company, Thomas J. Watson, to help him with the management of the company.
The new leader eclipsed the founder of IBM ( Watson's ideas remain the firm foundation on which corporate culture and identity are based).
Watson directed the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name indicates, began with the production and sale of all kinds of business equipment, from meat cutters and cheese to register boxes.
During the first four years that Watson led the company, billing doubled by $9 million and began the great expansion of the company across the continent.
Watson was so crucial to the company that, almost forty years after occupying the boss's chair, he was replaced by his son Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s IBM personnel and computers helped NASA guide flights to space (in Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the famous flight to the Moon).
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first generation of computers, the IBM System/360 series.
The classic "fish", which established the computer standard of that time, came to the market with the name of IBM 5150 in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, which, for its part, acquired the consulting part of Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to offer full advice and high value added services.
The strategy that has paid IBM over the past three years is the Smarter Planet concept, that is, "a smarter planet".
Its aim is to make more rational use of technology, although the areas have not yet been planned and the circumstances have not been improved, for example, in terms of transport and city administration.
For the trade sector, IBM recently presented the "Smart Commerce" platform that allows retailers to manage the full business cycle.
IBM has a long history in this country.
Already in 1932 he opened a branch in Czechoslovakia, the first country to have it in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM ČR also operates the strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe is in Prague. There is also a world-renowned research team working with voice recognition.
Rychtářová about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta, stay that ass, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) said it's over!
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) had become the only protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), but also her lover, Darina continued to hope that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and return home.
However, it will no longer wait and has established clear rules for life in the future.
"Pepe can go home, but not like my partner anymore," Rychtářová explained.
When Darina Rychtářová welcomed Bartošové in her house during the summer, she could not even imagine how her marriage would end.
Despite the request, Iveta had not moved thirty days after the song and Pepe did not abandon the singer.
He even publicly declared that he loved her.
In time, Darina resigned, apparently accepted her husband's relationship and even fired her forever.
Rychytář doesn't care who his wife is sleeping with.
If one day Rychtář broke up with Bartošová, his wife would not expect him at home with open arms.
He is the biological father of my children, and if you want to live the rest of your life in our home, no one will throw it away."
"But here I would live no longer like my dear old borrico who was wrong, but like a man to whom certain ties bind me," Rychtářová said and added that he had already disengaged from his husband and insisted only on mutual respect.
Joseph so far doesn't care that he's got his wife locked the back door.
"I accept my wife's decision."
"I will be with Iveta and there is no change possible."
"My wife has established this as a marriage on paper and I respect it."
"The company remains in force, I make house arrangements, I take care of the garden, the home, I make purchases."
"Darina and I talk to each other normally, the only thing is that we don't share bed," Rychtář said.
If Rychtářová found a new love, he wouldn't object.
"We don't sleep together and she doesn't interest me, where she goes or if she has any boyfriend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take full responsibility," Josef concludes.
The worst vices of women: Are they also referring to you?
If you ask men to be able to quote some typical vices of women, each of them will usually name them without thinking.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, where certain female vices are cited that are able to boil the blood to the boys?
Go to Shopping
Do you blame your average orange who is dependent on purchases?
Do you have to buy at least one trip a week?
Do you like to buy often in discounts?
Then in your case it can be said that going shopping has become a vice.
Some women realize that they should appease their passion for shopping, at least a little.
But to see, what woman could resist the temptation to walk no more through the clothing stores, look for well-adjusted clothes and then try them all on the tester (ideally in all different colors)?
Although for most women to go shopping is a hobby, for men it can become practically a hell.
Just remember how many times you've already told your partner that you better wait before the door.
The constant dissatisfaction
"Am I not too fat?"
"I would need to thin at least five kilos--should I start exercising?"
"Do you really like me?"
Don't you hear these phrases?
What do you mean?
Then she's one of those women obsessed with her appearance.
It is not that you should stop caring, but many men are allergic to hear your partner complain all the time about their physical appearance.
Strong sex also agrees that the higher the frequency of complaints, the more annoying women become.
Order and cleaning first
It's like an infinite tiuvivo.
Clean the windows, pass the vacuum cleaner, scrub the floor, remove the dust, scrub the tub and all that at least twice a week.
Do you blame your partner for stepping on the clean floor with a dirty foot, for his children who have soiled a freshly cleaned washbasin and a shelf with glass doors that cost him so much to clean?
In case you suffer this "deviation", try to be aware that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness certainly should not be considered paramount in the family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness could threaten your relationships and family well-being.
Making Disgusting Comments
"The worn underwear are left with dirty clothes."
"You want to wear those used socks tomorrow too"
"The wet rag is not left on the ground!"
If you make those cometarios to your couple more times a day, you know you'll be able to get him out of their boxes.
Of course, you don't mean anything wrong, you just want to get everything in order.
Perhaps, if men knew this, women, for their part, would not make so many comments.
Slanders and jokes
Some women also have slanders, jokes, but also offenses and conspiracy against someone.
Women focus on relationships, so they like to talk together about things like who, where, who, how, and why.
At best each of us sometimes escapes a small and harmless chism.
With the hand in the heart, this is like almost every woman.
On the other hand, there are women who are not controlled, who love to whisper and often do so, despise everyone and are dangerous to those around them, especially on a female work team.
Jágr and Voráček helped with their assistance to defeat Philadelphia
The Jaromír Jágr hockey front participated on Monday in the NHL meeting with two assistances that brought the victory over Philadelphia 5:3 in the Carolina court and put Czech players back in the forefront of the competition.
In both cases Claude Giroux took advantage of the 39-year-old star's play, and took one more step and was declared the best player of the game.
Two attendances were awarded to the party as well as Jágr's partner, Jakub Voraček.
After the meeting, Jágr stated to overseas journalists that Giroux had announced a great night.
"Before the game I had told him I'd make triple."
"I presented it."
"Sometimes they seem ambushed," Jágr explained, after his performance gave Giroux a goal, following the first flyers stretch.
A while later, the team's second intervention also had a Czech trail.
Voraček was made with the album behind the Hurricane gate and moved it between the circles until Maxim Talbot, who scored.
A second before the first break a local player, Patrick Dwyer, was expelled, but from the beginning of the second part they already dominated the Flyers.
Specifically for Giroux.
After collaborating with Jágr he scored the third goal, after his shot slipped through Wayne Simmonds' room.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't mean to say he's the best player in the field, but he's definitely among the three best," Jágr weighted his center.
"I would never have thought that at the end of my career I was going to play with a sportsman like him."
"I'm very satisfied with it."
"I want to play for him."
All these years at the NHL, my colleagues played for me, and that now produces results," Jágr adds.
Carolina still turned the party into a drama, with Tuom Ruutu's goal and then again from Dwyer, from the penalty, to a distance goal.
Matt Read did not allow any more complications, although they ended up outnumbered by two against one.
"Pronger had a good performance in our field."
"She took off the record, I took speed and Read went to the farthest part."
"I tried to touch the record and I'm happy that I got it," Voraček described the party's last goal as he lived.
With his victory, Philadelphia has taken the lead in the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal, Jaroslav Špaček, did not play until the end of the party against Buffalo, in the second third he retired for an injury at the top of the body.
Canadians not only lost a player with a lot of defense experience, but also by a two goal difference, 2:3.
Tomáš Plekanec was unable to take advantage of one of the shots.
More than the points lost to the local coach regretted the large number of injured in the last row, and play the game only with five defenses.
"That's bad."
"We played the game only with one veteran player, the rest were new."
"Finally, but there is nothing we can do about it, we have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"As much as rotating players turned against us, we couldn't resist him."
"We had to simplify the game even more, get the record out of our field."
"And so we leave gaps," explained one of the defenses, P.K. Subban.
Ondřej Pavelec contributed thirty interventions by Winnipeg in the 5:2 victory on Tampa Bay.
Jets' goals were marked by five players who thus put an end to a series of defeats that already lasted five matches.
How travel prices have evolved since 1989
Until 1989 there were only five authorized state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Travel agencies at that time sold in most cases only trips to the socialist bloc, as travel to the West was very restricted.
Czech tourists therefore went on vacation to the beaches of the GDR (German Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union, (Sochi in Crimea in the Black Sea) to Bulgaria and Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A positive exception was the period between 1962 and 1972, when it was possible to travel to Yugoslavia, however, after which the Yugoslav regime leaned westward and the travels of Czech tourists were then quite restricted.
A great paradox of socialism was the fact that the citizens of the socialist bloc (that is, also the Czechs) were not allowed to travel freely and individually not even by socialist countries.
If a citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter, if not, the individual trip was not possible.
Travel agencies also offered trips to the West in those days, but one had to line up with a sleeping bag and spend all night, or have "good acquaintances" in the agency.
Still, it wasn't all won.
The so-called "change promise" which was the condition for travel to the West, was not granted to the "politically unreliable person," who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency and, without guarantee of change, it was not possible to obtain the resources (the Western currency) to travel to the West.
The vast majority of Czechs spent their holidays in their own country, so there were a large number of cottages and summer houses, which the Czechs acquired. This custom still persists.
The way the Czechs travel has been undergoing a real revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 it was not for us to spend the holidays in the GDR or Bulgaria anymore, last year the Czechs made 4.5 million vacation trips to countries around the world.
It is a great paradox, of which we are no longer aware today, the fact that the current favourite destination, Croatia, until 1989, could not be travelled freely, because it was part of the Yugoslavia of that time.
In the early 1990s, the visa exemption was imposed to travel to neighbouring Western European States, resulting in a huge wave of short-term visits, particularly to Vienna or Germany.
The Czechs, for a long time, did not see themselves sick of the excursions to the West, everyone wanted to see it for at least a moment.
For example, in Paris the Czech groups slept in the parks in the country stores, as our income at the time did not allow us to pay a hotel or pension.
A typical feature of the Czechs of that time was to take with it the food (conservations, sausages, etc.) to save.
Another important moment was the introduction of the convertibility of the Czech krona, so our tourists could finally, after decades, buy free Western currency.
Our standard of living increased and with it the average wages, which about 1997 resulted in an increase in the demand for travel.
With the increase in travel demand the agencies began, from 1997 onwards regularly, to prepare the trips using charter flights connections, which caused the travel prices to drop dramatically compared to the past, thanks to the possibility of obtaining discounts by the volume of passengers.
By the end of the 90th century, the Czechs were already travelling visaless to almost all developed countries except the United States, which further simplified our travels.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary tourism happened already in 2000, when it was organized, thanks to a huge demand, the first direct flight from Czech Republic to an exotic country, and went to Thailand.
Since that year, direct charter flights with Czech tourists leave each year, making countries far and hot. This winter will already fly directly from Czech Republic to 12 exotic destinations.
The exotic countries currently visit about 100,000 Czechs a year.
Another interesting moment of this time, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development, arrived in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the United States eliminated visas for Czech tourists, so our country became among the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008, Czechs, for the first time in their history, spent more than half of their vacation abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, spent more than 15,000 Czech crowns per head on foreign travel, including expenses on the site of stay.
Called Ordinary General Assembly to elect the president, who could end up dead again.
For almost five months Czech football has been without president and it is likely that Ivan Hašek's successor as President of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR) will not be known after the convening of the next Extraordinary General Assembly that will take place on Thursday in Nymburk.
In fact, an agreement has not yet been reached on the voting rules to be followed.
Without them, no vote will be taken even to elect from among the three candidates.
The players involved in running Czech football are Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
Hašek resigned from office in June, not without convening his colleagues to find a strong person who knew how to deal with football in the future.
However, after the conclusion of the Hašek era, a dispute arose between the two federations of the association unable to reach an agreement to choose a common candidate.
This was evidenced on September 16 when the new president had to be elected.
Delegates of the General Assembly met in vain at the National House (Národní dÂm), located in the Prague district of Smíchov, because the talks had been blocked and not just about the method of choice.
There was no consensus on who in the General Assembly had the right to vote - only legal representatives or delegates with full powers.
From that moment on and due to this single point, a partial agreement was reached, supported also by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, according to which representation by full powers is not possible.
However, disputes over the electoral code remain open.
More light on the situation could no longer be shed by the Executive Committee which, in its ordinary or extraordinary meetings, basically resolved nothing.
The opinion on the possibility of voting has changed a couple of times already, but the neural point remains the same.
The question is: How do we proceed in the third round to avoid the dead spot?
"The dispute revolves around whether it should proceed according to the statutes or find another model," says Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice presidents of the FAČR, who, from the direction of the association, represents professional football.
According to the model proposed in the Statutes, the third round will win that candidate with the highest percentage of support in the federation to which he will submit his application.
The Moravia Region is ready to make a commitment so that it can win that candidate with a higher total percentage of votes in both federations.
The Bohemian part, however, imposes the condition that the winner, according to these percentage calculations, should have a majority of at least two thirds.
"This would, however, take away the meaning of the two previous rounds and completely deny the concept of the bicameral system," so is how Svoboda understands the objections of the living part, according to which it would be best not to touch the order and vote according to the applicable statutes.
Tomaš Paclík, surprisingly, also agrees, although it is assumed that the electoral regulations established by the statutes of all candidates are more appropriate to Pelta.
"I would like you to vote to the maximum in accordance with the statutes."
"In order not to invent any nonsense about representatives as in the last General Assembly," said Victoria Plzen's owner, who applied for the first time as a candidate and directed his remarks primarily against Pelta.
Pelta is still optimistic.
According to him, Nymburk will decide on the new president and he believes that candidates in the future will cooperate constructively.
"All passions will be reconciled with today's party of our national team at the European Championship.
"Football will again be the protagonist, and so will be more cooperative," said the representative of Jablonice, who of the three candidates has more experience in football management, both professionally and regionally.
Rajchl is the most reticent.
"I hope that an agreement will be reached, but unfortunately the situation is much more complicated."
"It's not about the conflict between Bohemians and Moors, but there are attempts to adjust the rules to their own convenience."
"This may result in a new blockade of the General Assembly."
"However, I hope the common sense will be imposed," Rajchl said.
There is no longer much time left for all parties to reach an agreement.
Some negotiations had to be held in Montenegro, but who can know until the party starts if the football team is complete?
The special plane, in which they had to travel to Podgorica, including Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, did not leave this morning for technical problems in Prague, having to look for an alternative to transport part of the executive committee to the place where the classification party will take place.
Perhaps the decisive meeting could at last be the one that will take place at the ministerial level, which is expected to take place on Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, would very much like to incorporate the divided parties into the country's most powerful sporting organization to reach an agreement.
There is much at stake: State subsidies, the credibility of football and also the next General Assembly of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Sports Federation (ČSTV) that will try to provide a new direction to Czech sport after the financial problems of the Sazka lottery house.
Paclík will fight to reach the presidency, because he does not find a more suitable candidate.
If Pilsen's head of footballers, Tomaš Paclik, prior to the extraordinary General Assembly, knew the name of an appropriate candidate who would satisfy all his ideas about the new president of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR), he would not apply for such a relevant position.
"If there was an appropriate person, I'd be fighting for her and I wouldn't be running for election."
"But to this day you have not been able to find such a person," Paclík said for the Czech News Agency (ČTK)
What motivates Paclík to enter the challenge with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl is exactly the possibility of blocking Pelta, the alleged winner of the elections, which paves the way for the presidency of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR).
Paclík also points out that, in case of winning, he would remain in office as president only until 2013, when the ordinary general assembly would arrive.
In that position, he would like to see an expert and good manager who is not too much related to football events.
"I've already talked to some people I might consider."
"It was crazy for me to hear some say that right now they don't even want to identify with Czech football."
"I would like to change that view," he adds.
What supposedly most upset Paclík at the moment is Pelta's relationship with the President of the Regional Football Association of Pilsen Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial past, known outside the world as a powerful lobbyist capable of influencing the vote of delegates in the general assembly.
For Paclík it is so unacceptable to see Pelta sitting in the presidential chair.
"If he wins, the status will remain in force and nothing in football will change."
"With the support of Berbra, an ambitious businessman, football will benefit even less," Paclík said.
It also mentions the fact that a few years ago the name of Pelta was associated with a telephone listening during the investigation of a case of corruption, from which Pelta went unpunished.
"I don't know what prestige football could bring Pelta's victory."
"And with what eyes will the UEFA and FIFA look at us," Paclík said, who also takes with caution his previous statement that "he would sell the Pilsen Club if Pelta becomes president."
In the case of winning Thursday's elections, Paclík could be asked to cooperate with Pelta in the future.
The other candidate, Rajchl, has been supported by Paclík before the September General Assembly, which ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to follow."
"He's very capable."
"I could imagine, for example, as head of representation."
"but not as manager of an association."
"I don't even put my noses where I don't feel able," added Paclík, who in September attracted much attention to supporting the suspension of the Arbitration Commission chaired by Ludek Macel, later replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Paclík admits that he would dare to manage the association.
It relies on its management capabilities of private companies, since last summer it has also been the Director of Pilsen, who, with his support, celebrated the first division triumph in May.
"I have the strength to change some things in the field of football and contribute to their safe practice."
"To reduce the influence of some pressure groups, which probably tend to influence the decisions of the disciplinary and appeal committee, producing unpleasant situations, Paclík said without hiding his antipathies towards the president of Sparta Daniel Křetínský.
One of the priorities would also be to strengthen the relationship between FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which it exerted pressure on political leaders to devote more money to the sport of lottery taxes.
"It is one of the key problems that the new president should be dedicated to."
"If gambling taxes are increased, as political parties announce, they would support their arguments, but, frankly, they have to tell us where all this money is going to stop," he says.
In addition, Paclík now does not even take into account his association with the Pilsner Club, although he himself claims that the President of the FAČR should be "non-partisan".
Pelta is in turn associated with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla in Prague.
"It's not ideal."
"But I don't see any sense of giving in hypocritically my shares of the Pilsen Club to someone else and then going back there after a year and a half," Paclík said.
Pelta promised FAČR new statutes that would end the deadlock of the elections.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the presidential candidates, Miroslav Pelt, promised that, in the event of election, it would ensure that FAČR had new statutes that would serve definitively to resolve the electoral regulations disputes in the future.
The representative of Jablonec is optimistic about this Thursday's meeting in Nymburk, and believes that the pre-election conflict could move towards a solution today with the possible victory of the football team.
Already before the elections not held in September, Pelta promised to focus, in case of election, on representation and fundraising.
He decided to participate in the last minute in the last general assembly, so this two-month postponement could help him to defend and present, in a broader context, his ideas on football management.
"People of all levels are already taking care of football a long time ago and expect to meet the new President on Thursday."
"They feel that the time has come for someone to manage the association," thinks the man who is primarily associated with the Jablonice Club, but who worked on the Sparta and the Association's executive committee.
For this reason, he believes he has enough experience to manage Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the elections is the euphoria prevailing in Ivan Hašek's time.
"Unfortunately, the General Assembly in June approved the statutes that were not as perfect as everyone thought."
"If we exclude certain interpretations, we have a president already since September," Pelta warned.
Exactly the re-adaptation of the most important document of the Civic Association was used as a sign to win delegates.
"If I'm elected president, I'll take it as a personal challenge and I'm willing to respond in case this fails."
"It is a matter of principles, without which we cannot exist," says Pelta.
Besides, in theory, he tries not to mess with his opponents.
In the past I had warned that he was working with Henry Rajchl, whom he respects for his training in law, being aware that his opponent would also be his first vice-president.
It had been a long time without attacking Thomas Paclík who, unlike Pelta, did not give up on him.
"It's been more than a year in the world of football, and it's already achieved some successes."
"His attacks but they were embarrassing and many people were surprised by the election campaign."
"That is why many of them doubt their true character," he told his opponent Pelta, who continues to be faithful to the statements announced already in September.
His most powerful weapon is, according to him, his knowledge of football, from lower competitions to superiors.
The latter should be a football promotion window.
"As well, he would try to solve all the scandals that arose because of the Bohemians as a result of the corruption scandal last year."
"I would immediately be involved in negotiations with the public and private sector, to ensure that there is enough money for all football," ČTK told 46-year-old candidate two months ago.
He also promised that his appointment as football president would not result in any personal changes to the staff.
"I should first know the tasks of each employee," he said referring to Strahov where, after a long period of anarchy, there is an understandable nervousness.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that are viticated before the next general assembly, he believes that delegates will not travel in vain this Thursday to Nymburk.
"If the only point of disagreement is how to vote in the third round, we will certainly overcome it.
"Football needs credibility, which will only recover if you finally have a leader," two days before the most decisive day in your career as a representative, Pelta remains optimistic.
Rajchl promises, under his leadership, the FAČR would start working eagerly.
If current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl is elected to the Fourth General Assembly as the new president of the Czech Football Association, many people would surely be resented.
Rajchl promises that if he is elected, he will work hard.
It wants to implement a systematic change and make executive committee members accountable for each football area individually.
He is also committed to resolving the case of the Bohemians, improving relations with UEFA and FIFA, getting more money for football and continuing the work initiated by former President Ivan Hašek.
"As president, I'd like to devote myself to football."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to selection, through professional football or the training of high-performance young footballers."
"With this I don't mean that I would do everything alone," Rajchl said in an interview for ČTK.
"I am a team player and I want to share the executive committee's competencies so that each member can devote himself to a specific area."
"And I will assign difficult tasks so that football can, in each of those segments, continue with a lot of momentum."
"Many people will probably not like this, because it will mean starting to work very hard and not just criticizing the work of others," he added.
Because of the atmosphere of criticism in the football movement, it is said that it has considered the possibility of not applying again.
"Everyone knows that I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that this will make sense and that there will be no people behind me who will stop me and hinder every step," he explained the reasons for his indecision.
"Many people have told me that I must not give up, because then they would give up the others too."
"It's about having faith not to give up like this, no more," he said.
They say it also motivates him to continue the work he has already begun with Hašek.
"During those two years, a large part of the work has ended that I don't want it to be lost now."
"There are processes that have begun and will have their effect in a couple of years and I would not like someone to stop them," he announced concerned that, if they chose the other candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the association could again be as it was before Hašek's time.
"I believe in order, and it is something that, in my opinion, Mirek Pelta is unable to maintain.
"Behind him is above all all all those people who would take care of football so it would be just a privilege for a few elected."
"I can blame a lot of things, but not the fact that I'm in favour of someone."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to make a football for everyone, because only so will everyone feel good and not only the chosen ones," Rajchl said.
He also rejects the idea that only the president would be bohemian.
"Although some people try to say otherwise, I have in mind doing my best for Moravia."
"For example, it's time to think about dividing the second division into one Czech part and another dwelling, whose winners would go to the first division."
"The current situation in which we have only three teams in Moravia would not be given, which represents a problem for young residents," Rajchl said.
Although the presidential election was supported by Tomaš Paclík, president of the Pilsner Club, Rajchl still believes in his ability to be elected.
"I am still sorry to have strong support from the Czech Federation, which elected me as its vice president and who knows that there are clear successes behind me," Rajchl said, whose successes include the saving of some tens of millions of crowns of disadvantaged contracts, the negotiation of television contracts and the negotiations on the law of lottery.
On the other hand, recognize your share of guilt that the federation is not united.
And while he proclaims that Pelta is "unqualified to regain confidence in Czech football," he considers the other rival, Paclík, as a strong candidate who does have something to offer to football.
"No one can deny that he did a great job for Pilsen that year."
"If it is elected, it will probably follow what Ivan Hašek has already begun and would not significantly change the staffing of the committees."
"I don't want to use that for me," he evaluates his rivals Rajchl.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
Jump to blue
by Julia Stanek
Swimming pools from an incredible viewpoint, sumptuous baths in Budapest: Anyone who visits Europe can live his blue wonder, and, after a visit to the city or a walk, rest his tired legs in bubble baths.
A book shows where the best well-being is found in the water.
When Iris Meder made a research trip last year and a half, there was something he could not miss in his luggage, a bather.
He lay his back on the water, stared at the dome on the top, swam towards the marble angelots, waiting at the edge of the pool and was astonished at the modernist indoor pool meticulously restored.
He liked the bathroom, took note in his notebook at the time of all the interesting details about the style and history of the building.
The architectural historian Meder explored more than 200 swimming pools in this way and presents them in his recent book "Badefreuden": the indoor pools in Munich, the historic bathroom palaces in the Black Forest, the "constructions of concrete" in Taunus.
He made his "travel through the most extraordinary baths in Central Europe" by 13 countries: In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, he visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a city respectively in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
This 46-year-old German is a true enthusiast of the bathroom culture.
He doesn't want to have anything to do with sports, says Meder, only water is different.
It only bothers you that lovers of the bathroom have to conform to blue tiles and chlorine-hodor, while lovers of running can breathe the fascinating smell of the fir forests or listen to the happy trenches of the birds in the park.
"One day I wondered why swimming pools have to be so ugly," said this Vienna resident.
"I started collecting beautiful pools."
The surface of the water doubles architecture.
The dip in the pool and the ethereal sauna oils. The wellness factor in the pools is so great because all senses are cared for, according to Meder.
And if the builder tries, the indoor pools can be a real gift for the view: "Instead of the floor, in the bathrooms there is a water surface."
"On the one hand it is transparent, on the other, it reflects the beauty of the entire building."
Everything folds optically: the high vaults, the colored tiles, the trampolines.
The book with photographs in small format "Badefreuden" provides in 190 pages very interesting data about architecture and art history in the historical oasis of well-being, but, above all, it is willing to jump to the blue.
Meder, the pool collector discovers the outstanding examples in his research in Hungary.
Along with the magnificent medicinal baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, the waters are found with nitrates in a unique karstic cavity (baths in cavities in Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as some spas, whose swimming pools are alkaline waters and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termalfürdö in Jászberény).
Many swimming pools discovered in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: While the whole city has eyes on the roofed pool in Zurich, you can look at Arlberb, covered in snow, from the outdoor swimming pool of a bathroom in St. Antón, and: In the Turkish bath there is a window from which you can observe the practice on the ski slopes.
The design, perhaps most extraordinary, awaits customers in Längenfeld: Ötztal's water cathedral looks like an ovni that has just landed in the Alps.
From three open sources rise steam in winter, while the Ötztal mountains rise deep into the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Meder, the pool collector, did not invade his chlorine scent in all pools.
Many thermal baths smell sulphur, in the baths of Árpád in Békscaba, Hungary, the plague to gas oil is so strong that people think they have come to a bathroom.
The smell comes from medicinal waters that contain bicarbonate and alkalis and whose legume sticks to the skin when entering the pool, a enjoyment of well-being in a special way.
Iris Meder was also disappointed in a place in his search for beautiful places for the bathroom, when he wanted to visit discovered swimming pools and sunbathing in the Czech bath of Luhatschowitz, he met with a blocked land.
The 1902 bathroom by architect Duan Jurkovic was closed.
When Meder looked through the demolished windows of the modernist red, white and yellow building, he saw the trunk grow among the tiles.
The decline countered a lovely pool in the Black Forest: the Thermal Palace in Bad Wildbald.
These bathrooms have three phases of construction after themselves; they can not only be discovered neo-Romanic elements of their construction times in 1844, but also an Alhambra-style Arab hall, added in 1900.
Since its great modernization in 1995, the Thermal Palace is the favorite bathroom of the pool collector, Iris Meder, and not just because it is natural of the Black Forest.
"It has a lot of merit to merge different architectural styles into such a fantastic unit," Meder says.
In a palace like this, diving into the thermal pool apparently doesn't matter much.
Agrarian speculation
Deutsche Bank analyses the raw materials business
By Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank give up its agricultural raw materials business?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to verify the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the head of the consortium wants to show the consequences.
Hamburg,
For citizens, it is clear, according to one study, that 84 percent of Germans do not consider it acceptable for banks to speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize.
Two thirds of respondents claim that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions withdraw from this business because it increases the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a survey by the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report submitted to Foodwatch in mid-October.
Author Harald Schumann shows that global commodity stock betting increases prices, and banks bear responsibility for the global hunger problem.
The consumer advocate's campaign is specifically directed at Josef Ackermann, director of the Deutsche Bank, although large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, bets on raw materials were designed to protect traders from price fluctuations.
The main experts agree that players have disappointed offers and demands, and make profits from the costs of the poorest.
Ackermann reacted to criticism differently than US competitors: He promised to review the claims and said no business "deserves to compromise the good reputation of Deutsche Bank".
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is reviewing the demands of the Foodwatch report.
The analysis must be completed at the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the Deutsche Bank directive, together with the recommendation on how to handle the matter.
At the end of January, the management of the bank will report on the consequences.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the raw materials business, or even its total abandonment.
Ackermann is trying to fix his image.
Thilo Bode, founder of Foodwatch, celebrated the news, but reaffirmed his criticisms of the financial sector: "Bets at increasing food prices show particularly drastic how ruthless banks currently harm public welfare."
Ackermann is the largest bank manager, especially in the bonds.
"The Deutsche Bank must cancel all investments in its portfolio in which it puts the money at stake for food price bets," Bode said.
"It doesn't matter whether Ackermann deals with the issue of people who go hungry or the fame of Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann's inspection is surprising at first sight, but it is clear that the consortium chief wants to offer a perfect picture a few months before leaving his post.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank published that the chairman of the Board of Directors will change something different from that not planned in the Board of Directors.
With the abandonment of the controversial agricultural speculation you can perfect your image.
And he needs you to hardly care for any losses, that's what your successor will take care of.
Two thirds would cancel investment in raw materials
Foodwatch strives to keep the pressure on the manager high.
So far, more than 30,000 netizens have participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Forza Institute had asked 1,001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Only 10 per cent considered it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments in which food prices were waged.
Many bank customers showed personal consequences when they discovered that their bank was involved in such businesses: according to the survey, two thirds would cancel all investments from which money comes from agricultural speculation.
43 percent would rule out such a bank to their acquaintances, 49 percent would request, after reflection, cancel their account and switch to another institute.
House 21 in Vienna
The Transferred Pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with heights and a happy ending, the pavilion of the Austrian universal exhibition in Brussels of 1958 won prizes, was in Vienna for a museum, remained empty and collapsed.
It now reopens as an exhibition house.
The modern post-gerra architecture passionately, the clear forms, glass halls, the brave curves and new building materials, typical of thinking about technical progress, for which, the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 universal exhibition of Brussels is an appropriate and well-known example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion then obtained the Architecture Grand Prix for its light and floating steel and glass construction.
Construction is considered to be a contemporary milestone of architecture to date.
He made the well-known architect who also built the Austrian pavilion at the following universal exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder tower for MBW plus the adjacent building flattened in Munich, it became internationally known.
Its pavilion, designed as a temporary exhibition construction, rose after the universal exhibition at Schweizer Garten next to the southern Vienna station, was reformed in 1962 and a 20th-century museum was inaugurated called "House 20".
The building was suitable but lacked the appropriate spaces and technology for a museum; without any wall to hang art, not a good environment.
Despite this, it was used until contemporary art in Vienna had a new home.
The building has been empty since 2001 and decays more and more.
Currently, architect Adolf Krischanitz reformed the pavilion, now calls it "home 21" and will be used in the future as a museum of contemporary art.
On Tuesday afternoon the Belvedere museum was inaugurated, to which the house belongs, with the first exhibition, a stroke of luck in a certain way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new director of the Austrian Belvedere gallery since 2007, achieved a new beginning.
Husslein-Arco, a doctor in art history with a considerable career, among other things, artistic skater on ice in his youth, later in Sotheby, the Guggenheim Museum and founding director of the Salzburg Museum of Modern Art, carried out reforms with the insistence of politicians and protectors of monuments, provided public funds and private sponsors and established their use.
With the exception of contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba of the homonymous foundation are exhibited, there should be a coffee shop and a bookshop and also a office building should be built.
Strict control, low budget
Krischanitz was the best choice to make.
Not only because Joseph Olbrichs' secession in Vienna was significantly reformed, he was extended and awarded the competition, but because he studied with Schwanzwer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was for him a "great and huge place", in which he contemplated "almost every weekend" the exhibitions.
He knew the project and the problem of the building, which disappeared with its transfer to Vienna in its change of use with generosity and ease.
In the current reforms, there are major problems, the building was "an energy eater," said Krischanitz.
The profile of the windows on the glass facade was changed, an insulating glass reinforced with fiberglass was installed and the glass ceiling was replaced by a special safety crystal.
Thermal bridges and steel beams were strengthened or replaced and asbestos roofs were rehabilitated.
Two basements were used for new use, a light panel down between the house and the street provides lighting, a bridge serves to enter the building almost new, but still the Schwanzer pavilion.
The original exterior doors remain, the house is painted in ancient shades of kaoba and protected against oxidation.
And the movie room is exactly what it was like before.
And all this with strict control by the office of monuments and a low budget.
"I often had to find material that was good, cheap and also like the monument protection office," says Krischanitz and warns of rough soil in the basement.
Despite all pressures, problems and reforms, the building remains flexible and light.
The "which came from Brussels" pavilion has been difficult, said Krischanitz recently, a typical "accidental appearance in the history of the city".
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and that's why I wanted to "awaken the right conscience."
In this case house 21 is not in the wrong place, there has been a hit of urban luck. The totally new and planned "central station neighborhood", with homes and offices, is located next to Schweizer Garten.
And perhaps another stroke of luck happens: House 21 could receive a reinforcement of another construction of Krischanitz, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin temporary art room and, as you hear, negotiates with the city on a neighboring place at the Schweizer Garten.
Deutsche Bahn plans a winter crisis package that amounts to millions
The company has devised a crisis plan, which would avoid the damage of the trains in winter.
The number of staff should be doubled.
Which costs millions.
In the fight against damage and delays in the trains caused by winter, Deutsche Bahn spent more than EUR 70 million this year, according to a journalistic report.
The "Bild" newspaper reported, invoking an internal crisis plan of the group, the planned investments up to 2005 of approximately EUR 300 million.
For what we must achieve a better availability of vehicles and the rail network even at an extreme time.
Among other things, it is planned to double internal and external employees to 16,000 posts to remove snow from the roads and the Andeans.
The aim is to clean the snow and ice slopes for operation and 90 percent of the needles necessary for operation within four to five hours.
Two months ago, Rüdiger Grube, president of Deutsche Bahn, warned of train crashes and delays also during this winter after a summit with the government and industry.
Last winter, Deutsche Bahn suffered considerable problems in passenger transport, as he lacked reservations about adverse weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for authorization from the Federal Railway Office for years.
There is also a delay in the delivery of high-speed trains.
Deutsche Bahn has been working for years to check the axes of high-speed trains frequently in the workshop, after a high-speed train suffered the breaking of an axis in the central station of Cologne.
Deutsche Bank pays millions of fines in the United States
After the riot over President Josef Ackerman, a new US problem appears, Deutsche Bank must pay a millionaire fine there.
As if the problems were not enough for the Deutche Bank, its past in the United States acquires the sector giant, the Frankfurt Institute pays $145 million (EUR 120 million) in an agreement to end the contents due to the bankruptcy of five large credit cooperatives during the financial crisis.
This is about the sale of mortgage securities.
The NCUA Financial Market Regulator condemns many large banks inducing credit cooperatives with false promises to buy financial products; they have minimised the risks.
Such titles lost their value during the financial crisis and dragged the banks to the depths.
"We are pleased to be able to clarify the matter without the parties having to go to the courts," said a spokesman for the Deutsche Bank in New York.
The bank does not admit any guilt with the agreement.
This also applies to Citigroup, which required a payment of $20.5 million.
Debbie Matz, president of NCUA, celebrated the deferral of both financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. credit cooperatives and provides support in case of bankruptcy to protect client investments.
NCUA is trying to reintegrate the losses of millions.
The agreements currently closed are their first type.
The regulator had also called for accounts from other large banks and in summer disputes against JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the case of dubious mortgage securities, these are the so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on housing credits.
When the U.S. real estate bubble broke out in 2007, it led to the loss of many financial institutions.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Although the results happened a few years ago, today a complicated wind blows for U.S. banks.
Investors and inspection have initiated countless processes for receiving compensation or sanctioning faults.
The Federal Housing Financing Agency (FHFA) has produced the largest number of claims.
It reproduces to the 18 large international banks that the two US state mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have taken advantage of the mortgage business in a volume of approximately $200 billion.
The Deutsche Bank also has a demand for FHFA, which is business worth $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The inspection requires the Frankfurt Institute to respond to "substantial losses", without naming an exact figure.
The Deutsche Bank rejected debts as unfounded and explained that it wants to defend itself.
Warren Buffett contributes 10 billion to IBM
The Finance Guru, Buffett, strongly invests in the IBM Information Technology Company.
Since March it has acquired shares worth more than $10 billion.
So far the great American investor Warren Buffett has always declared no investment in computer companies or information technologies as long-term business development forecasts are negative.
But he has read IBM's trade report and changed his opinion on investing in the sector.
He must have understood much earlier that IBM offers mainly services and seeks computer systems for other companies' information technology departments.
In the financial world, Warren Buffett's investment is considered an honor.
Therefore, the primitive of Information Technologies should be called "Sir IBM".
Buffett has currently unveiled at the CNBC Economic Station that has acquired IBM shares worth $10.7 billion since March.
Its Berkshire Hathaway investment has promoted it to one of the largest shareholders of IBM with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said IBM didn't know anything about the commitment so far.
He commended the leadership that dealt with the regular benefits in the economic crisis.
"They did a great job," Buffett said about the strategy.
IBM has for some time established the services of Profitable Information Technologies such as the operation of calculation centres.
The old computer pioneer over 100 years old also offers software and advice as well as powerful equipment for companies.
Buffett avoided technology companies so far.
He said he was only investing in companies whose business I would understand.
On the contrary, Buffett took advantage of the occasion on a freight train, a lubricant manufacturer or a mechanical engineer.
Its Berkshire Hathaway has about 80 own subsidiaries, as well as part of a whole series of large consortia such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, formerly Münchener Rück.
Buffett, 81, took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 60s and, with wise investments, expanded it to one of the most valuable companies in the world.
However, his life - style is humble.
That's why it's an idol for countless investors around the world.
His quick and infallible sense of making money has given him the nickname "Omaha's oracle".
After discovering Buffett's investment, IBM stock in stock exchange rose by one percent.
"The blue giant", as IBM is known, has a stock value of more than $220 billion and figure, along with Apple and Microsoft, among the most valuable technology companies in the world.
With Microsoft, Buffett said, he doesn't want to collaborate.
Bill Gates, his founder, is a close friend.
The threat is taken into account
After the discovery of "Zwickau's cell", Turkish media doubt the state of German law.
A newspaper speaks of a "bloody ideology" that revives itself.
The murders of eight small, trick and Greek entrepreneurs between 2001 and 2006 have a background on the far right.
Turkey and the German population of Turkish origin have responded with fear and concern to this news.
For many Germans of Turkish origin returns a ghost that was believed to have died a long time ago, since the fire-shaped attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, no more episodes of violence with extreme right-wing background against the Turks had occurred.
However, it has never been questioned that there is xenophobia in Germany.
The ultra-rightist network discovered reveals a magnitude whose dimensions were not, at least, predictable.
"Is the bloody ideology revived again?", entitled the online edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The newspaper "Sabah" points out on the contrary that one of the perpetrators of the crime was an informant from the Federal Office for the Defence of the Constitution and is concerned that the German authorities may be involved in the ultra-rightist panthenal.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted wisely, the weekend reminded the victims of racist violence on a vigil at the Brandenburg Gate.
Two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin along with German and Turkish politicians reflected on a solemn act of the fiftieth anniversary of the Turkish-German agreement.
The cohabitation was set up in joyful colors, like a happy ending story.
The information came to some Turkish media as a slap: "The German present for the fiftieth anniversary," says the title of an article on the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", referring to the background of the murder chain.
The German broadcast "Hürriyet" also insists on tracing this mental connection.
"It starts to smell bad," says the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci.
He stressed that the murderers were people who paid their taxes and made an important contribution with their work to the reconstruction of Germany.
In the Internet forums of Turkish-born Germans, police behaviour and their subsequent success in searches are discussed very critically.
The authors are surprised that the German authorities have not long sought out suspects in the circle of the ultra-right.
Some are less rhetorical about the drastic media: "From now on immigrants are lost than self-defense and armament."
"This will be the best self-protection."
"The internal peace of Germany depends heavily on the quality of the clarification and the adequacy of the sanction to the entire network.", writes "Selen".
Which means that, if Germany's internal peace is in danger, the attacks on Mölln and Solingen will be cleared up in ninety years.
The image of the ruins of the Solingen fire has been recorded in the German and Turkish memories.
No other event showed more clearly to the Turks who live here that there is a specific threat and, to the Germans, that distrust and distance can lead to violence.
Attacks exacerbate the group feeling of the Turkish side.
Do not repeat past mistakes
The Turkish press then criticized mainly the failure of German politics after the attacks, Helmut Kohl refuses to visit the survivors of Mölln.
Following the attack in the form of a fire in Solingen sent a telegram of condolences to Turkish President Klaus Kinkel, his foreign minister, replaced him at the funeral in Cologne. Kinkel detailed in his speech what the Turks of Germany contribute with taxes.
It is clear how a person's value is calculated according to the amount of his taxes.
The current information from the Turkish media shows again how deep it has been since, the mistrust of many Germans of Turkish origin in the legality of this country.
In addition to the effort of a comprehensive explanation and an overvaluation of extreme right-wing terrorism in Germany, frank words are needed this time.
The Lake Zurich scandal bank
The most risky bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS almost collapsed in the financial crisis and has since slipped from one crisis to the next.
Now she's headed by a German.
I'm sure Axel Weber hadn't thought about it.
After his spectacular departure from the Federal Bank Summit in July, it was known that in 2013 he would start in a new and almost equally spectacular work: Chairman of the Board of the Swiss Bank, an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber is publicly glad, praises Switzerland for its beauty and the UBS for its newly acquired solidity and drops friendly remarks about its future companions.
"The USB has achieved revitalization."
"I am pleased to collaborate with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
In September it became clear that everything would be totally different.
A USB financial operator in London avoided all bank security systems and defrauded 1.7 billion euros.
Oswald Grübel, general director of the USB, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to come.
The president of the USB Administrative Board has since been considered equally touched, and everyone has asked: When does Axel Weber arrive?
It was known that Weber will have to advise the bank since February 2012.
And he will take over the chairmanship of the Administrative Council in May, not in early 2013, as the bank reported on Tuesday.
This is hard for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, but a professor of economics and counsellor and has had a period of adaptation that is surely necessary.
Suddenly he is responsible for the strategy of a bank, which has just re-tested that he deserves the title "the biggest bank in the scandal of Europe" for a long time.
On the one hand, the USB is huge, until recently it was the world's largest asset administrator, and on the other hand, for years, it has slipped from one scandal to the next.
Nothing, as it seems, is saved to such a proud Swiss bank back then.
The financial crisis began.
The USB had an excellent reputation until 2007.
The image of the discreet and solid Swiss asset manager, but also handy, was combined with ambitious objectives, also wanted to be a large number in investment banks.
On the one hand, with $1.6 billion, the USB manages more money from wealthy customers than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, it advanced as an investment bank in the league of the world's big banks.
This impresses.
Hans Geiger, the former banker and later banker teacher in Zurich for many years explains: "Before my students, I have always qualified the USB as a model of a good bank."
"From the current point of view, one asks, "How could I be wrong?"
I was in a big mistake.
In 2007, something came to light that went very badly on the USB.
In mid-year, Peter Wuffli, CEO, who until then was considered a great and very smart banker, resigned surprisingly.
A few months later, the reason was suspected.
The bank's investment fund embarked on high-risk securities losses and had to amortize billions.
To carry out this, the USB announced a capital injection of no less than 13 billion francs.
To this end, he found investors, of course, that some had looked with contempt until just before: an Asian and opaque state fund of Singapore and an Arab state fund, so discreet, that his name had never been heard.
This was just the first blow.
In April 2008, it worsened.
The bank had to declare the loss of billions, Marcel Ospel, president of the administrative council, in 2006 in the second best paid administrative council in Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, the disaster continued, in view of its wrong investments, the UBS found itself in the financial crisis in the face of bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the state.
The national bank bought problematic values from the UBS for many billions, the Helvetic Confederation gave six billion francs for a compulsory convertible bond, by which it became the co-owner of the bank.
All Switzerland was affected, it was stated how dramatic this was for a small country, if it accommodates such large banks.
Finally, the sum of the UBS balance sheet in 2007 was more than five times higher than the economic results of Switzerland (see chart).
"We can't rescue the UBS again," said Geiger, bank expert.
The first disaster was joined by the second.
A few months later, the UBS capitulated in a fiscal conflict with America and showed willingness to deliver data from wealthy customers, who had possibly been taxed with the help of the bank.
In addition, it approves a figure of $780 billion, refunding unwarranted profits from these businesses with compensation for payment.
With this, the UBS confessed more or less to have helped in tax fraud.
At the same time he lost something that had always been his capital in the competition by rich customers: the discretion aureola.
After the scandal, the secret of the Swiss bank is no longer the same.
This followed the resignation of the chairman of the board of directors and the chairman of the board of directors.
And the exodus of client funds.
In this way, in a few months the bank lost its credibility in its two central sectors: in the investment bank by mis speculation and in the administration of goods by aiding tax fraud.
And just when I was getting a little bit quieter again, just when I thought the UBS would get it back, this wretched story of the operator happens, an individual operator cheated 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realized something was wrong.
And it was revealed, apparently, that this still does not work well with risk management in the investment bank.
"With the Adoboli case it is evident that risk controls have changed too little," says Martin Janssen, professor of economy and finance at the Zurich University Banking Institute.
The financial director of a large German bank is also certain: "The problem of the UBS is that it does not dominate the risk controls".
So the idea of precaution arose, with which the Swiss bankers had long presented themselves, to be the guardians of the world's largest assets: no risk too great, however, the security of money wants to break across the Alpine Republic.
Swiss banks' security deposits were the symbol of unbreakable reliability, such as Lindt and Sprüngli of authentic chocolate.
The central UBS in Zurich does not fit with the cliché of the Swiss solid private bank, it is just a little bigger.
The situation is classic.
The bank has its main seat on the Baynhofstraße Street in Zurich, which runs from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, framed by the snow-covered summits of the Swiss mountains.
Here the buildings are ostentatious, the rentals are one of the highest in Europe.
Here you will find jewelry such as Tiffany`s among Swiss traditional businesses such as Sprüngli confectionery.
Swiss banks have lived here for years: from the national bank, through the building of Credit Suisse, to the elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
It enters the reception room of the UBS through a heavy swivel door.
Inside the walls are covered with marble, ahead are large leather armchairs, next to the bank logo there is a large sign to indicate the "safety".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: Security.
The two large Swiss banks, the UBS and Credit Suisse, have at some point moved the idea of the large Swiss bank, or betrayed it, as the president of a small Swiss private bank believes.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, in the end and in the end he does, like all Swiss bankers, also with the business of both large banks.
The UBS has become too large, it believes, mainly in the investment bank, where the Anglo-Saxons have gained ground.
There the Swiss had nothing more to say.
"And they have been used to the customs of Anglo-Saxons for a long time."
In fact, the UBS changed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank, handed over its first big profit and then came the disaster, no European financial entity had lost as much money in the high-risk jungle as the Swiss big bank.
On 15 October 2008, the disaster was evident.
"On Wednesday the government coalition of the small country of seven million decided the largest rescue operation in the history of its nation," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "Der UBS-Crash" ("The Crash of the UBS" in Spanish).
Politicians granted up to 68 billion francs or approximately 45 billion euros to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How do you think they're doing?
They talk to Swiss bankers, so they see the problem in the UBS dimension.
In June 1998, two of the three large Swiss banks were merged into a powerful consortium.
A bank emerges that, due to the merger, was too large for small Switzerland, and continues to grow.
It thus served to complement the two different precursor banks of the UBS: a rich but sleeping bank with the asset management centre in Zurich and a poorer but stronger internationalization.
Suddenly, the internationalised investment banks arrived in a timely way with a lot of money, with which they could run a large financial bicycle.
There are two names related to this rise in the UBS: Peter Wuffli, head of the UBS consortium from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then president of the administrative council.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a perfect team," says bank expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the intellectual, modest, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive that managed to open up a step from learning at the bank to the summit."
Finally, Ospel trusted Wuffli.
And at the end Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake: "He thought his models were a reality," Geiger says.
"It's a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
It is clear: The destiny arrived before the case.
UBS employees clearly remember directors' meetings, where Wuffli, the head of the consortium, repeated the same motto: Get down from the throne to Goldman Sachs.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
They headed the "League Tables", the classifications that then documented the success of the banks.
The UBS wanted to be at the summit.
Some steps worked out well for him.
In foreign exchange operations and in the negotiation of shares it was at the highest.
However, the company advisors in charge highlighted a weakness: In the business of international interest, in the banking language "fixed inme", there is huge compensation for large banks.
The UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
To fill these gaps, the UBS began an adventure that almost cost it its existence.
Greedy for growth, they invested both the same bank and one of their high-risk funds created in US high-risk investments.
It turned into a powerful machine to capitalize on American mortgage credits and then sell them, maintaining certain risks to its own account.
And also, like other banks, he sought the drop for a long time.
"In the summer of 2007, as the American real estate market was on fire, the UBS bought there," said Geiger, an expert in banking.
So great the euphoria, so deep the fall.
One manager had to leave, as the attempt to order was more complicated than they expected.
The UBS posts have become projectable seats and are insecure to date.
At present, who runs a large bank has almost impossible work.
You must find a strategy for a bank, before which all logical business models are lost.
Geiger, an expert in banks, has an idea, put an end to the investment bank, concentrate on asset management, return to the Swiss roots.
The bank doesn't want to get that far (yet).
But the investment bank must decline a lot, it is clear at present.
On Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the new president of the bank, will present his future strategy to the world.
In fact, only 51-year-old Italian-Swiss was thought of as a transitional solution, as the bank separated surprisingly from its predecessor Grübel.
However, he imposed himself: He must permanently direct the UBS business, communicated the Zurich bank on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return the investment bank to its state in the mid-1990s.
Removes 3,500 posts.
But this isn't enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is it?
What do you want to make money with?
These are the questions Axel Weber is definitely asking at present.
So far he's only saying he'll first find a home with his wife in Zurich.
Next year.

Smart fats spread in cities
In many places the fats are considered "problem birds": they do not expel these very intelligent animals from the cities for a long time, say the experts.
Some like them, others want to get rid of them very quickly, the fats have belonged for years to the image of the city, but in many municipalities the complaints of the neighbors are accumulated for the trash and the noise of the animals.
Although no means has appeared against the "problem birds" so far.
The fats no longer leave the cities, say experts at the first symposium on fats in Leer, East Frisia.
There specialists from all over the national territory discuss possible solutions.
Looking for alternatives in cities
Ecologists attribute the problems of cities to migration from the field of certain protected fats; chemical applications in agriculture visibly end up with traditional vital spaces.
Hunting, growing building and falling trees that host them make life difficult for birds.
The fats are protected.
There are large colonies with more than 600 breeding couples in Soest, Westphalia, among others, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen, as well as in Leer.
There in 2005 a controversial project to kill the district's fats was launched by negative media headlines.
Critics have qualified the hunting of animals by trappings for birds and killing with sticks as particularly brutal.
"Expulsing them and escaping them normally does not get anything," said Werner Klöver, urbanist and landscaper of Leer.
Shooting the nests with water or throwing the trees are usually unwanted consequences, says Manfred Kaiser, environmental expert at Lahr, Baden-Wurtemberg.
"The animals deviate, the large colonies divide and distribute elsewhere."
Running away is only imaginable as an exception in hospitals, residences of elders or schools.
"We must live with them, we no longer catch them."
Without the surroundings, the problem is not solved in the cities, says Wolfgang Kellner, Mayor of Leer.
A combination of animals from sensitive residential areas and baits may be used to re-enter the site.
"Information panels instead of chain saws" Uta Maria Jürgens, psychologist and ethnologist advertises against in order to treat animals in a completely different way: "The best thing is that we can hold a peak in the face with aplom."
Jürgens co-founded in Schleswig-Holstein the teaching circuit on Ascheberger's fats, where signers report on the life of intelligent birds.
Meanwhile, the project is accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also has his own opinion on the criticism of bird noise: "All are forms of communication, they have much to say."
The intelligence and skill of these animals are legendary, fats not only take advantage of resources to access tiny skeletons, but they manufacture tools to use them as resources.
Recently, etologists at Cambridge University checked in four degrees how far the intelligence of birds has reached.
In one experiment, birds quickly learned that they should drop a stone on a platform to reach a pollen larva.
Without much training, they firmly recognized the size and shape that the stone should have to fall on the platform.
In a second trial, the sly fats had to solve a complicated problem.
The researchers placed a small cube with a pollen larva in a vertical cylinder.
The birds could not reach their prey with the peak.
But the investigators left them a piece of wire.
With which the four animals formed a hook, with which they fished the bucket in the pipe shooter.
Three of the four fats got it in the first attempt.
Portugal at the Eurocopa 2012 thanks to Cristiano Ronaldo
The Bosnians and Turks have no hope in the championship.
The favourites, Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland will also be in Eurocopa 2012.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have sealed in the play-offs the latest Euro Cup tickets 2012 in Poland and Ukraine.

The former Bundesliga professional, Zvjezdan Misimovic with a penalty (41.) and Captain Emir Spahic (65.) shortened distances to Bosnia twice.
Sena Lulic obtained a red card (54.).
Bosnia failed because of Portugal in the 2010 South Africa World Playoffs.
At the Lisbon Stadium of Luz, Portugal started perfectly.
Ronaldo executed a free direct from more than 30 meters to put himself at the head of the points.
A quarter of an hour later, Nani showed her dowries to score from far away and got 2-0 from 25 meters.
The Bosnians, who didn't look in the first half hour, had their first clear opportunity thanks to the goalkeeper Edin Dzeko.
The former player of the Wolfsburg team, leader of English Manchester City sent a head to the pole, but the ball did not cross the doorline (33).
Jiracek right for the Czech Republic
Then Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding stood in the hurricane's eye.
After the attack on Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penati area, he decided to show Portuguese the yellow card for throwing himself to the ground (36.).
On the opposite side, Stark pitted a controversial criminalty after an action by Fabio Centrao, who transformed Misimovic.
After the break, the European vice champion of 2004 clarified everything with 4 goals.
The Czechs ended the last doubt in the 81st minute with the goal of Petr Jiracek.
The 1976 European champion is ranked fifth consecutively for the Eurocopa.
Coach Michal Bilek's team with the Bundesliga legionary Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1. FC Nürnberg) was also lucky and had to overcome a second reaction in the initial phase.
At the last moment, the gatekeeper Petr Cech avoided with a reflection a possible goal in his own door of Tomas Sivok (9).
Montenegro had more possibilities with the Dou Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic in action.
Damjanovic marked in the 40th minute of the front turn, very right in the Cech gate.
After the break the Czechs had to protect the width of the world-famous porter, the FC Seoul front again escaped (50.).
Finally, the goal before the end sentenced the game.
Meanwhile, Turkey mistook the wonder of Zagreb's football.
Four days after 0-3 in Istanbul, the Turks did not pass 0-0 in Zagreb.
While it was almost certain that the national coach Guus Hidedink had to leave his seat on the world's third-party bench in 2002, the Croats celebrated their fourth participation at the end of the Eurocopa.
Before 31,000 spectators at Maksimir Stadium, the Turks almost got a dream principle.
In the seventh minute and with a long-distance kick, Selcuk Inan only managed to play the post. The attacker Kazim Kazim was not able to send the ball inside the gate.
After the second reaction, Croatia increasingly assumed control.
After the break, Croatia did not allow any goal to be achieved.
Along with Mario Mandzukic of Vfl Wolfsburg, which in the minute 62. took place Ivan Perisic of Dortmund, Danijel Pranjic (Bayern of Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) are the legionaries of the Bundesliga in practice.
Trapatoni goes to Eurocopa
In Dublin, the Irish celebrate their first participation in the Euro Cup since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward took coach Giovanni Trapattoni's team, who won with the 4-0 in the pre-decision round, he got the lead in the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) empathized with the guest team.
Ireland pressed from the beginning, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, when Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had his first great opportunity.
From the very first moment, the defense has been avoiding possible goals of advantage.
But in the 32nd minute, he went ahead.
After a defense by the porter Pavel Londak, Ward appeared and kicked the ball across the line, getting 1-0.

Personal massacre
The intense and generous new book by Peter Englund, The Beauty and Pain of the Battle (The Beauty and the Sorrow): An intimate story about the First World War, "starts with a long character drama that can make one fall his soul to his feet.
Here are some action tips: Start this page gently and turn it into your brand pages.
He will get to know these people very well in Mr. Englund's novelist narrative, and this dramatic personae will function as his GPS, a beacon during those few moments when, like one of his men and women, he is confused and helpless in the fog of war.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, who grants the Nobel Prize in Literature.
What he has written here is an unusual book, which rightly describes as "an anti-history work".
It contains some notable names, important treaties or famous battles; there are virtually no ambassadors, elegant journalists or discussions about tactics or material.
It is not so much a book about what happened, it explains, as "a book about how it happened." It deals with "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods."
"The beauty and pain of the battle" combines the experiences in times of war of more than 20 ordinary men and women, on both sides of the war, from colleges and botanists to escalators, doctors, ambulance drivers and administrative.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Some will become prisoners of war, or lose their members, become mad or die.
Their lives blink here as votive candles lit in a church; some new ones are added to the mixture while others are turned off.
Mr. Englund's book is a deviation from standard history books.
It is also a corrective to the notion that World War I was only the disastrous trenches war on the western front.
"The beauty and pain of the battle" moves expertly through other war theaters: the Alps, the Balkans, the eastern front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book fall upon the hives; one spends Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the tse-tse flies are an intrusible problem.
This is a moving book, almost from the beginning.
War floods the lives of these people like a natural catastrophe, a hurricane Katrina that stinks of cord.
When the artillery fire is heard in the distance, and you're a woman who's at home with your children, do you stay or flee?
Who's coming anyway?
Almost no one understands what's going on, not even why you have to fight this war.
"Fair of fact," observes Mr Englund, "has been filled with conjectures, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"The Beauty and Pain of the Battle" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor of the high seas fleet.
His stories have been obtained in most of his previously published memories, letters and other material.
The explanations of their lives may be frightening or touching, but they are more full of life in the accumulation of small moments, lost details, of Mr. Englund.
Many of these are about deprivation and settling them with what is.
About telling the story of a German schoolgirl says, "Sucedanes, everywhere they happen."
Coffee substitute, false aluminum, imitation rubber, paper sales, wooden buttons.
He continues to talk about successive food in Germany.
It describes "meat made from rice cooked and pressed in beef fat (and finished with a false bone made of wood); tobacco made of roots and peels of dried potatoes; shoes with wooden soles".
There are, notes, "837 permitted meat substitutes in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes".
Some stories are about honor and courage.
An American recognizes his own impulse towards wildling and manifests about war: "You feel that, after all, this is for what men are designed and not to sit in armchairs with a cigarette and a whisky, the afternoon newspaper or a best seller, and pretend that that varnish means civilization and that there is no barbarian behind that tarnished and tarnished fence."
On the other hand, a British soldier realizes that he will probably die, and that no one will find out or care.
"Once one resists the thought of sacrificing himself, one would like to think that it could happen in front of the public," he writes.
On the other hand, it is horribly similar to "to a convicted person being strangled in secret."
Other comments are about an old Europe disappearing, and about new types of terror.
"The conflict has become increasingly an economic competition," writes Mr. Englund, "a war between factories."
Reflects the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the livestock of the young century: The killer in eloquent mass and ideologically convinced with clothes of good making that performs his butcher's while sitting behind a desk."
People behave in unexpected ways; there is both innoble and heroic behavior.
Mr Englund speaks of the soldiers who actively tried to catch a venereal disease of prostitutes as a way of escaping service on the front.
"The most grotesque expression of this can be seen in the trade of gonococcal pus, which soldiers buy and embattle with it their genitals in the hope of ending up in the hospital," he writes.
"Those who are truly desperate rub it on their eyes, which often leads to a lifetime blindness."
In this translation of Swedish made by Peter Graves, the prose of Mr Englund agile but not extravagant, is perfectly adapted to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, it reflects the way in which war has "desired exceptionally uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People start asking why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books about World War I have often been indirect, such as The Great War and the modern memory of Paul Fussell, or novels like No News on the forehead of Erich María Remarque, instead of full stories.
Mr Englund's volume joins an unconventional pantheon.
His book has one of the most devastating endings I can remember in a non-fiction work.
I won't reveal it.
But it's as if he came from his book, ripped that page of dramatis personae from your fingers, and burned it with a cherry.
After a false step in advance, a planned assault per minute
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing anti-disturbed helmets.
The night was chosen from Monday to Tuesday because Zuccotti Park would be more empty.
The operation remained secret except for a few high-ranking officers, initially telling others that they were joining an exercise.
Police Inspector Raymond W. Kelly was at the center, his presence emphasized how the operation was facing challenges for the police department.
Recent weeks' episodes could not be repeated, such as spray spray spraying pepper on demonstrators, violating the rules of the department and creating a storm of public sympathy towards the "okupas".
And so the police operation to clear Zuccotti Park of demonstrators was revealed after two weeks of planning and training.
The officers had been prepared to see how occupations had developed in other cities.
A major disaster simulation was taking place in Randalls Island, with an eye looking towards Zuccotti.
Officers increased the so-called training of riots - counter-terrorism measures that involved rapidly mobilizing a large number of police officers - to focus on the Lower Manhattan.
The last training session was on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
Orders to enter the park came in the "last minute," said someone familiar with the orders, who referred to the mission only as "an exercise".
"The few cops I know were called for this, they didn't tell them it was to enter Zuccotti Park," said the person, who spoke anonymously.
"The only people who knew they were going to enter Zuccotti Park were at the highest levels of the department."
One reason for secrecy was a lesson learned by the city.
On 14 October, some officers wanted to clear the park, but they gave up when hundreds of demonstrators emerged before time after hearing about the plans.
The Tuesday operation involved agents from several police units, including special forces throughout the municipal district - dozens of mobile agents who used to flood neighborhoods with high crime rates.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, like those who travel daily to work, had been going and coming from the park during the day, making 1 a.m. a good time to get in.
"It was appropriate to do so when the smallest number of people were in the park," he said.
Trucks from the Emergency Services Unit with focussed and loudspeakers gathered at the Pike Slip crossing with Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near Manhattan Bridge, before leaving.
The lights and pre-recorded messages resounding from the speakers seemed to intimidate many demonstrators.
Community affairs agents went to the park with their clear blue windshields, many demonstrators simply picked up their things and left.
No store was touched until 1:45 a.m., the police said, giving demonstrators time to collect their belongings.
Other teams of agents were seen meeting in the perimeter to enter if there was a need for arrests in the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to abandon him.
Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesperson for the Police Department, said it was for his safety.
But many journalists said that they tried to prevent the police from taking action in the park, and that they had been dealt with abruptly by the agents.
Mr Browne said that mobile television units on Church Street, along the western edge of the park, were able to capture images.
As the police moved west through the dense tide of personal effects of the demonstrators, including luggage and bags of paper and plastic waste packed with clothing, the cleaning department's equipment followed them, collecting what was left behind.
Some demonstrators who refused to move were dragged out, appearing images on the Internet shortly thereafter.
A central group of protesters took positions near the camp kitchen area, near the center of the park.
Some made a barrier, and the police went in to arrest them methodically.
About 10 people in the epicenter of the camp were locked between them by their arms.
And two people chained to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Emergency service officers were called to cut the locks.
No arrests were made at the park until about 3:30 a.m., said Mr. Kelly.
The eviction operation was complete about 75 minutes later, said the police.
Mr Browne said about 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests were due to "change in public order and resistance to authority," he said.
The highest-ranking officer on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the senior officer uniformed in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the head of detectives in the department, was also there.
Mr. Kelly, while he was present, "he wasn't running operations," said Mr. Browne.
A second group of agents waited along the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar streets, in case they had to enter.
They stood barricaded on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block south.
From those positions, the police were seen extending the perimeter even beyond Zuccotti Park.
At one point, a number of agents, many of them with shields, were seen pushing people out.
There were about 28 people in the northern perimeter.
Some of the most noisy action of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protester jumped over the hood of a police car, and others were seen taking off the air from the wheels of a police van.
At one point, a piece of plywood flew out of the crowd.
In the end, an agent and a protestor were hospitalized.
The union of support workers will sue the city for dismissals
The union that represents hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plans to sue the city on Wednesday, claiming that dismissals were unnecessary and discriminatory due to their disproportionate impact on schools that serve poor students.
The demand is possibly the last weapon available to the union, of the municipal district 37, in its effort to revoke the dismissals.
Sixty-two school assistants, parents' coordinators and other employees who were among the worst paid in the city lost their jobs on 7 October, in a movement that trade union leaders described as political revenge for their refusal to allow, last spring, city access to a health care fund from working groups to close their budget gap.
The municipal authorities have categorically denied that accusation.
At a hearing in the City Hall last month, education counselor Dennis M. Walcott said that dismissals were part of the budget approved in June.
One member of the Council countered by saying that nothing in the budget specified that school support staff would be fired.
Municipal officials 37 said they filed the complaint in writing, warning the Department of Education that it would be sued. A press conference will be held on Wednesday to announce the official submission of the complaint, at the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The claim will include Mr. Walcott and the Department of Education of the city as accused, and has eight workers dismissed as plaintiffs, all black or Latin women, as well as most of the assistants who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesperson for the City's Legal Department, said that the city had not seen the demand and therefore could not comment on its specific allegations.
According to a draft of the claim obtained by The New York Times, the trade union has focused on the number of layoffs in poor city schools to support a claim for unfair treatment, saying that poor schools lost more assistants, as they had been undersubsidised chronically.
It is noted that although there were no layoffs in Staten Island and a few layoffs in schools on the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school assistants lost their jobs in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were fired in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Taking into account the loss of five of the eight assistants employed by Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the demand says, "This is not a neighborhood of wealthy parents who can raise funds to cover the budget deficit."
P.D. District budget 36 was reduced by 3.26 percent this year, and also lost money when the city changed the way it calculates additional funding for each enrollment per poor student in schools.
The union also states that the directors of secondary schools may have been fooled by language in a memorandum authorising the dismissal of parents' coordinators.
The memorandum used the word "surplus" to describe the action, although "surplus" more often describes the act of transferring a paymaster from a school to a work bag, whose salaries are paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six parents coordinators were fired," says the draft of the complaint, "and not just in excess."
Mission completed, Congress prepared to reach agreement on Libya
It seems that finally Republicans and Democrats in the Capitol are willing to agree on something related to the uprising in Libya.
All that was needed was for the rebellion to succeed, for veteran dictator Muamar el Gadafi to be captured and killed and for US participation to come to an end.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee will consider a resolution, sponsored by President John Kerry (Democrat by Massachusetts), along with Senators John McCain (Republican by Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (independent by Connecticut), applauding the Libyans for their successful rebellion and US troops for their "Valance".
"This resolution is to honor the braves of Libya, when they begin to rebuild their country," Kerry said.
"It is a statement of bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations."
Language may seem harmless, but nothing about the debate on Libya has been easy so far.
This summer, the legislators of both parties fought with each other and with the White House on drafting a series of resolutions to approve or reject the role of the US military in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain submitted a resolution authorizing the limited use of US military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated in the House by a broad bipartisan margin, and it never came to vote in the Senate.
But on the same day the bill was rejected in the House, the camera also rejected a measure that would have cut funds for US operations in Libya.
That left the U.S. mission in a sort of legislative purgatory - with Congress as annoying as to criticize Obama's management of the mission, but not as angry as actually to harvest the grass under his feet.
The Congress's indecision was then overcome by events.
Tripoli fell into the hands of the Libyan rebels in August, and Gadafi was killed on 20 October.
The NATO mission ended officially on 31 October.
Now the Senate could be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs " congratulates the people of Libya on their tremendous courage and extraordinary resistance to free themselves" and " commends the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism."
The resolution also "declares the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure gain the full support of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, or will it divide legislators as the June bill did?
The latest version was rejected by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indiana), the principal Republican of the committee.
Lugar spokesperson said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new bill.
Beyond the Capitol, the House will vote this week on a constitutional amendment demanding a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republican congressmen and some Democrats.
The measure, sponsored by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Republiced by Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other item that actually achieves a vote of the entire assembly in the House or Senate in this Congress.
Other legislators have not succeeded so far in bringing their amendments to the assembly, but not due to lack of attempts.
Goodlatte's is just one of the 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced in this Congress, covering a wide range of issues.
Some are duplicated - the same bill is proposed in both the House and the Senate - and others with slight variations between themselves.
There are at least 15 versions of the amendment of the budgetary balance only in the House, and another handful that "will control federal spending."
Some of these bills are also identical to each other, but they give their sponsors - especially new Republicans who seek to refine their curricula - the opportunity to boast that they were the "authors" of this measure.
The Budget Control Act, which was passed in August, required both the House and the Senate to vote on an amendment to the budget balance.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution that supported the idea of that amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of mandates that members of Congress can fulfil, while the representative José E. Serrano (Democrat of New York) wants to remove the limit of two mandates for presidents.
The representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat by Illinois) has proposed a number of amendments that guarantee the right to quality education and health care, among others.
An amendment prohibiting homosexual marriage is a perennial proposal, as well as one prohibiting the burning of flags.
Some legislators also want to allow federal laws to be abolished if they are rejected by two thirds of the states.
So enthusiastic that members have been proposing amendments, they are not moving at a faster pace than in previous years.
At the 111th Congress, the legislators proposed 77 amendments, and presented 66 in the 110th.
The pace is unacceptable compared with that of the 1990s when members regularly tabled more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they didn't have much more success then than they have now.
The last amendment which was added - 27 - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Bounce but not defeated," Giffords talks in his first TV interview since the shooting
Ten months after a gunman shot him in a constituent act in Tucson, representative Gabrielle Giffords (Democrat by Arizona) appeared on national television on Monday night, sang accompanied by Broadway's melody "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said he wanted to recover more than he wanted to return to Congress.
In his appearance in ABC News "20/20", with Diane Sawyer, Giffords struggled to form prayers and needed help walking.
The program documented its difficult way back from the damage caused by a bullet that fractured his skull and drilled the left side of his brain, and passing from the front to the back of his head.
Three months ago, he returned to the House in surprise to issue his successful vote in the debt ceiling agreement.
In his first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six and injured 13, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and described his recovery as "difficult".
When Sawyer asked how he felt, 41-year-old Giffords said, "Very good."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour "20/20" special program, which was issued on the eve of the publication of the new couple's book, "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope".
The special programme analysed the recovery of Giffords since the shooting on 8 January.
In videos recorded by Kelly in the first few weeks, she is seen in her hospital bed, with a shaved head and a long scar across her forehead.
She can only hold one or two fingers up, while her husband encourages her.
Months later, you see Giffords sitting in a wheelchair while therapists teach you how to perform simple actions.
A head movement.
A mouth-breathing.
And then his first word, "What."
Within a few days, Giffords pronounced another word - "everything", a change request on his breakfast menu.
Videos broadcast by ABC show that music played a central role in the recovery of Giffords: She sees the congressman singing along with the therapists the songs "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper and "Free Falling" by Tom Petty.
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who has been on therapy every day for two hours, said he doesn't remember shooting day.
Her husband said he was reading to Giffords an article in the newspaper about the murder of 12 March when she stopped him to ask for the first time about the six who had died in the incident.
The suspicious gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is being arrested in a Missouri prison and being forcibly medicated while awaiting trial.
"Many people died," Giffords told Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
Kelly told Sawyer that at a time of his wife's recovery, she said, "I've been defeated."
"So, I told him, "'Gabby, you haven't been defeated," Kelly said.
"You've only been beaten.
And you're gonna get out of this, and you're gonna get yourself back and you're gonna come back harder than ever."
Troops make them feel more sorry than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about impotence, frustration and loss.
At that time, several hundred soldiers, sailors, aviators, and marine children broke into their posts around him.
The crowd of labels stood up and applauded.
"The men and women were considered heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the collection of spring funds.
A high-ranking military officer at the gala, also known as the then President of the Joint Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were shown as a sort of orphan," the officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know they had them.
But it wasn't respect, really.
The markedly contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship taken by the military and a often distant American audience, sometimes worshiping.
He gives praise to the troops for their sacrifices.
But the praise has a price, say the members of the service.
The public acts more and more as if they hurt those uniformed.
"We are not victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded the troops in Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way some show their support is to put ourselves in the role of helpless souls."
The subject is a very sensitive subject for military leaders, who do not want to look unpleasant or disagree with the audience they serve.
They also realize that the anger faced by the troops who returned in recent years of the Vietnam war was much worse.
As a result, most of the discussions on grief take place in silence and in private among war veterans.
After his two sons returned from fighting with the Marine Infantry, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that people apart from the military would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with a feeling of fear because they faced the insurgents and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if there would be "an angry and violent veteran under the surface," said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to high-level government work in Washington.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some interviewers had asked him subtly whether he would be able to endure under the pressure of a demanding Washington job immediately after his combat tour.
"When you talk about your service, you need to face negative impressions," Cancian recalled telling his children.
The military concern arises, in part, from the American indifference to wars.
The achievements on the battlefield are rarely chosen for praise by a country that has little familiarity with the military and sees few direct benefits from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.
"We, as a nation, no longer value military heroism in ways that were completely common in World War II," said retired lieutenant general David Barno, who commanded US troops in Afghanistan.
On the other hand, the praise of politicians and the public is largely focused on the depth of the suffering of a member of the service.
Troops are recognized by the number of tours they have endured, the number of friends they have lost, or the extent of their injuries.
Army Faces Growing Pressure to End Rape
This week, a historical audience will decide whether 28 women and men have a case against the army for their alleged passivity to rape.
If not, hundreds of applicants are organizing for the following.
First soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 and 11 weeks pregnant the night she said she was raped by a mate.
It was October 2008, and he was heading back to his headquarters at the Miramar Air Base, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend when he met a colleague who was carrying a pack of 12 cans of beer.
He asked if he could join her in her room for a drink.
"It was an alarm signal," says Lyman.
However, the Texas native put aside her concern.
I thought, no, he's 19.
"It's from Texas," he says.
"I wish I'd listened to my instincts."
Within minutes of entering Lyman's room, the man approached him from behind, throwing her down and raping her, he claims.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and another 27 members of current and former military personnel look forward to a judicial decision in a historic trial to be held in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether the lawsuit they filed against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor Donald Rumsfeld will be brought to trial.
The claim alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to reduce the widespread violation among the military, in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
Submitted in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., the claim initially involved 17 plaintiffs, but grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, they all claim that they were raped or sexually assaulted by their comrades, and that the army failed in investigating, prosecuting, or providing adequate justice after the alleged assaults.
Burke says he's going to get the bigger plane of the army, because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a structure from up to down," he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to eradicate the culture of reprisals?"
Burke also says that since February, nearly 400 more survivors have been contacted, many of whom may be part of future demands.
Your strategy: Instead of accumulating all the applicants in this case, putting all the eggs in the same basket, so to speak, will present several cases, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.
The defence team for the Department of Defence, led by federal prosecutor Neil MacBride, has tabled a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defence strategy - in essence, that the military cannot be sued by current or former soldiers for injuries suffered in the armed forces.
By a judgment of the 1950 Supreme Court called Doctrine Ferries, the federal government is not responsible for the damage suffered by active staff.
"The damage alleged is part of the military service of the complainants," the documents say.
The Department of Defence refused to comment on this article.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women are still officially forbidden to serve in combat, this distinction is only nominal: Modern wars rarely have clear front lines.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of women soldiers are playing increasingly important roles, especially to reach local women in war zones.
The result: between those two wars, 150 women soldiers have died and two thirds of them have been killed in combat situations.
It's time for the army to modernize, says Burke.
She's not alone in her struggle, and three other demands are in progress, besides hers.
At Yale Law School, the Legal Services Clinic for Veterans is preparing a case against the four main military academies for allegedly promoting a misogynistic environment.
On the other hand, the non-profit organization Vietnam Veterans of America is composing a demand against the army that focuses on the diagnoses of " personality disorder" assigned to victims of rape in order to release them from service - a common event, according to activists, such as Anu Bhagwati of the Women's Action Network in Service, a group of human rights.
Its group filed a complaint in December against the Veterans Administration, accusing it of discriminatory practices in the way it handles claims for benefits for persons who claim to have been sexually assaulted in the service.
Nine separate bills have been tabled in Congress by a two-party mix of senators and representatives, proposing a series of corrections.
In 2010, there were 3,158 reported sexual assaults, according to the Office for the Prevention of Sexual Assault and the Department of Defence Response.
However, the attacks are significantly below reported, and by the Pentagon's own estimates, which account for approximately 13.5 per cent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also examines the processing rates: in 2010, 20 per cent of the reported cases in the army were tried - half that in the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case describe their attacks as just the first of a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, he reported the alleged violation of the military police less than an hour after it happened.
That night, he says, he was asked to tell the details of his rape 11 times different from a multitude of police, doctors, and commanders.
She submitted to a rape kit, and the blood of her aggressor - from a cut in her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a hearing before a judge, during which he was asked about having sexual intercourse with his boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six persons testified as personality witnesses on behalf of the alleged author, who was finally acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was read," says Lyman.
"I thought I was going to work -- I found myself screaming from the room."
"They put me in the psych ward, and when I got out, I remember telling my commanding officer, "That wasn't his judgment. That was my judgment."
Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist, who finally diagnosed a personality disorder, which made her unfit for service.
In January 2010, it was exempted from service under less-than-honour terms, which prevents it from receiving any benefit.
As to whether the case presented by Lyman and his suitmates continues, it is a very remote possibility, says John Turley, Professor of Law at George Washington School of Law.
However, he says, "In my opinion, they should be able to move on."
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first published.
I've been a permanent critic of Doctrine Ferris.
The army is decades behind because it does not have the same incentive and deterrence that raises responsibility.
And he adds, "Probabilities are strongly against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the audience doesn't go their way, Burke, the plaintiff's lawyer, will put his other hundreds of applicants in line for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until the reform happens," he says.
"Or until we die, what happens first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Researchers Are Studying You on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just another guy who aired his anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to having carried out a massacre in Norway in July, which left 77 dead, faced his first public court hearing.
While Breivik could have acted alone, he was far from being alone in cyberspace: He had spent most of the time before his attack on his computer, talking to some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social networks.
After this summer's tragedy, researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy - you just have to go to Facebook.
"We realized that it was not so difficult to reach them," says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recent report on European digital populism by the British DEMOS study centre.
The personal information ally of Facebook is so encyclopedic, says Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the advertising tool to determine their desired demographic characteristics with scientific precision - the way the sellers have been using for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million right-wing fans across Europe and then they directed ads, but instead of linking them to a new band or diet product, the ads invited users to complete a survey asking about their educational level, attitudes towards violence and optimism about their own future.
On arriving through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to study more than 10,000 followers of 14 extreme right parties in 11 European countries - all without leaving the office.
"It's a totally new way of doing an investigation," Bartlett says.
Some of the results are not entirely surprising: Online supporters of right-wing groups tend to be young, men and angry about immigration.
However, in a kind of spin, "those who combine their online activism with off-line activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who stay behind the computer screen."
DEMOS's work is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new and important tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centers, medical researchers and political scientists are using the site to study everything, from health problems to social trends as expressed in the "I like", messages on the walls and state updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three content pieces per day, Facebook's "data supernova" is generating an increase in research, boosting the number of academic jobs with the name of the site in the title up to almost 800% in the last five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you couldn't get close to with a folder on the street.
"In the past, when you tried to interview people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You should go through the game, and they would never allow you access," Bartlett says.
"Facebook removes all that -- you go straight to them."
Others say that the site could provide a way to identify and address health-social problems.
A recent study conducted by Dr. Megan Moreno, University of Wisconsin-Madison and her colleagues, found that university students who talked about their drunken exploits on Facebook had a significantly higher risk of having drinking problems than students who remained silent on the subject.
Moreno suggests that fellow students, such as residential advisors, could control the site and intervene to help a student who publishes too many state updates with their drunkards.
"You can't handle a problem if you can't diagnose it," said Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Moreno and director of the Child Health, Behavior and Development Centre at the Seattle Institute of Child Research, Washington Post.
"We have found a way to identify children at risk who would otherwise not be diagnosed."
Facebook is also constantly "punching" its own population to obtain data.
The Site Data Team has developed statistics on the status of the relationship and Valentine's Day, the expectation of electoral participation in the middle of the legislative period of 2010, and a National Happiness Index (mainly using information that can be accessed - digital freedom defenders long ago who maintain that the site should make available to others their large amount of research data).
However, Facebook users know that the site is watching them, they like it or not - the sacrifice to be able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away is to allow the site to mine your personal information.
But what happens when Facebook users become part of a survey they don't even know?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to collect their offline data, online is a free bar for everyone.
"I don't think many of the users have even thought about the fact that a researcher might be examining their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, about a 2006 study that carried out with the public Facebook walls of students.
"As far as they were concerned, it was only between them and their friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even off-line, there is no guarantee that an investigation topic is being completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know that part of the information on a user's profile and the messages on the wall are true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside Facebook are two completely different things," Selwyn says.
That's why, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn believes that a pen and pen are still the best research tools no one can use.
"There is no substitute for entering the real world and talking to real people," he says.
"Social research is supposed to be about social -- and a lot of social still happens off-line."
"Friend and inhuman: Anders Behring Breivik makes his first public appearance in court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to being the brain of the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has described himself as a "resistance" fighter during his first public appearance in the Oslo court.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and in the Templar Knights of Norway," he said in front of a room full of 500 people.
"I oppose the court, since it has received the mandate of organizations that support the ideology of hate and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the facts but I don't plead guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during that monologue, because "I didn't want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this audience as a platform to express his views."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who delivered a written speech in advance, to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, prohibited him from accessing the media for four weeks, and said the authorities would have to have strict control over all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came hoping to look at Breivik in the eyes, others to confirm that he is under house arrest.
They all attended with the aim of moving towards the conclusion.
"I thought it looked cold and inhuman," said a Utoya survivor to the Norwegian NRK station.
"It was uncomfortable, but for me it was a step forward after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Dressed in a dark blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the audience and looked at journalists and survivors in his eyes when he entered and left the building.
Despite Breivik's strange notion of being part of a greater "resistance" movement, the judge determined that he is not a mental illness, and said that there is no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
Some may be advised that the attacks on 22 July seem to be the work of an extremist rather than a group of radicals.
But that does not automatically soften the pain and confusion that a whole nation still feels.
"I'd like him to look like a monster, but he doesn't look like it," said a victim's relative.
"It would be much easier if it looked like it."
7 Lessons from Steve Jobs' Lost Interview, shown in a theater this week
After Steve Jobs died on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford — distinguishing the genius of technology as the Great Modern Inventor.
But what Apple fans might find more revealing, in an interview to newly rediscovered Jobs that has been dismantled as the advance of a series of special projections in the larger markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood about the business processes and workflows of the products.
It was undoubtedly a self-recognized designer, dreamer, and hippie, but it was also a meticulous organizer and an enuki of flow diagrams - a man who believed that many executives suffered "a disease that consists in thinking that a great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] there is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the TV series The Triumph of the Nerds on the top of the personal computer, and he sat for more than an hour with Jobs for an extensive and rare conversation.
At that time they had been barely 10 years since Jobs had been forced to leave Apple, and already worked intensively in their new NeXT computer company, waiting for popular Internet adoption.
While a small part of Cringely's interview was used in Nerds, he said that the originals of the interview disappeared during his transport.
It was only after Jobs died that a complete copy of VHS was discovered in the director's garage.
This archive material, slightly reissued, is the basis of Steve Jobs: The 68-minute lost interview that arrives at the Landmark cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known to hate in-depth interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly willing to expose his technological philosophies and commercial strategies.
And very thoughtful.
In four different points throughout the interview, there are great silences between questions and answers - from 10 to 15 seconds of reflections, where Jobs is clearly weighing his thoughts, seeking precision.
There are also times when Jobs' perfectionism comes to the surface, where it seems impatient due to Cringely's questions, pushing him to go faster towards the subjects or arguments of greater importance.
Filmed before the era of Pixar, the iPod or the iPhone, there is something strangely prophetic in The Lost Interview, when Jobs evaluates what other companies see doing right and wrong, and offers their own vision of the future of computer science.
One thing is to read posthumous evaluations of Job's career, but there's something raw and inspiring in the Jobs we see here, the eager dreamer on the edge of greatness.
He has a vision of how they can and must be things.
Not long after explaining everything in detail here, he went and did.
A quick summary of seven remarkable sequences of The Lost Interview:
About how he learned to run a business:
"Over the years in the business, I always asked: "Why do you do things?" and the answers they give you in an invariable way are: "Oh, that's just the way it's done."
No one knows why he does what he does, in business no one thinks about things very deeply.
That's what I found.
Jobs brings to the detail its efforts to simplify Apple's accounting.
Disturbed by the way in which the costs were recorded - often starting with a "standard cost" that was made to the eye of good cover, and then adjusted with a "variable" - developed an automated factory that ensured that they could determine the commercial costs in detail.
About the Pope's joke:
Jobs tells the "Blue Box" that he himself built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to hack effectively the phone company and make long-distance calls for free.
It has been extensively written about the device, but the euphoria of Jobs here depicting the Blue Box as an act of empowerment is contagious.
Describes how he and Wozniak tested the box using a public phone, making one call, and then connecting from one AT & T network to another, while creating a loop with as many satellites as possible.
"We were involved around the world a half dozen times and you screamed through the public phone and returned a minute later to the public phone from the next door," Jobs says with a laugh.
"We were young and what we learned was that we could build something ourselves that could control billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world."
The two of us, we didn't know much, but we could build a little thing that could control a giant thing -- it was an incredible lesson, and I don't think Apple would ever have existed without it.
Jobs continues to describe a glorious joke that he and Wozniak almost abandon, calling the Vatican through the Blue Box in the middle of the night and asking to speak with the Pope while doing his best imitation of Henry Kissinger.
As several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak with the American diplomat, the two burst into jail just before the Pope himself was awake to answer the phone.
About falling in love with technology (and selling by phone with Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, to the hunting of spare parts to build a frequency counter, he searched for Bill Hewlett in the phone guide and made a call.
Shortly after his 20-minute phone conversation, Jobs got a part-time summer job in Hewlett-Packard.
"That was a remarkable influence on me, it was the only company I had seen at that age and formed my vision of what was a company and how well they treated their employees."
Jobs later became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desk computer ever made".
It was as big as a suitcase, it had a small cathode tube screen, and I fell in love with it.
I'd get a trip to HP as a teenager and waste time with that machine and write programs for her.
On improvising innovation:
In several points of the interview, Jobs talks about inventing new products on the march.
Soon in his career, as he dedicated himself to selling a handful of base plates, he asked a customer if he could mount the whole team.
Working with only 30 days of credit, I had to find out the assembly and delivery of finished devices.
Later, while he was in Apple, he recalls the struggles he faced in the development of a computer mouse:
"I remember having dramatic arguments... they screamed that it would take five years [to create a mouse that would cost 300 dollars], and I got sick and left and found a designer.
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could build for 15 dollars and it was totally reliable.
About big companies losing strength:
Long before he led Apple's rebirth, Jobs prophesied how many industry leaders would stumble in their vision, and lose control of their market share.
"He says you work in IBM or Xerox, so you make better photocopiers and printers, so what?"
You have the monopoly of the market share, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing departments increase success, so it is this kind of people who end up leading the companies and the people responsible for the products are expelled from the decision-making forum.
The genius of the products that led to that monopoly position is rotten because of people who do not have the notion of good products versus bad products - the knowledge of the necessary trade.
That's what happened in Xerox...
Xerox could have taken over the entire computer industry.
Could have been ten times its size, could have been the Microsoft of the 1990s...
They took the victory defeat.
About innovation as an artistic expression:
"There is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product... as the great idea evolves, changes and grows."
Much is learned about its subtleties.
There are sacrifices you have to make - some things you can't make make electrons, glass makes them, robots make them, factories do them.
You have to keep 5,000 things in your brain -- these concepts -- all adjust them at once...
In the end everything is reduced to taste - it goes down to trying to expose yourself to the best that a human team has done, and then try to adapt those things to which you are doing.
Picasso said good artists copy, great artists steal.
We've never been ashamed about stealing big ideas.
What partly made Macintosh great was that the people who were working on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who were randomly the best computer scientists in the world.
If it wasn't for computer science, it could be doing wonderful things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas dinner with the rivals of the Health Care Act while the court accepts the case
On the day the Supreme Court met in private to examine the politically controversial question of whether they would accept the challenge to President Obama's Health Care Act, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were hosted at a dinner sponsored by the firm of lawyers who will present the case before the High Court.
The occasion was last Thursday, when the nine judges met in a preliminary hearing to thoroughly study requests for review.
One of the cases in question was a demand filed by 26 states challenging the total reform of health care adopted by Congress last year, a law that has been a war cry for conservative activists across the country.
The judges agreed to admit that the application is being processed and, in fact, a historical claim is expected to be 5 and a half hours by March, and the result will probably further disrupt the 2012 presidential career, which will be at the height of the time when the court's decision is known.
The lawyer who will appear before the court and claim that the law must be discarded will probably be Paul Clement, who served as U.S. Attorney General during the government of George W. Bush.
Clement's firm of lawyers, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a group that has been dedicated for many years to defending conservative legal principles.
Another signature sponsoring dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Independent Business Federation.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., who has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the dispute.
Dinner was held at a Washington hotel, hours after the court's preliminary hearing on the case.
Among the attendees was Mitch McConnell, the most important Republican in the Senate and a declared opponent of the Health Care Act.
The special guests at dinner?
It is nothing new: The two judges have been attending events of the Federalist Society for years.
And it's not something that conflicts with ethical standards.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct governing the actions of lower federal judges.
If they were not, it could be said that they would fall under the Canon Code 4C, which says: "A judge may attend events to raise funds from law-related organizations and others, although the judge cannot be a speaker, an honored guest, or be on the agenda of such an event " .
However, the absolute proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms in the case, as well as to a company with enormous financial interest, was enough to alarm ethical activists in the government.
"This striking breach of ethics and indifference to the code goes against the demands of several judges who comply with the same rules as apply to all federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of Common Cause.
"The judges were provided in a gala fund collection with lawyers who have pending cases before the court."
Its appearance and assistance in fundraising for this event undermines any demand for impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest in criticism that they claim to mix the court's activity too easily with the agenda driven by groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife, Ginni, is a prominent conservative activist.
On the other hand, conservatives argue that it is magistrate Elena Kagan, who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan worked as a general prosecutor for the Obama administration when the first legal challenges were presented to the law in the court of first instance.
His critics have pressed for Kagan to refrain from seeing the case, saying that he was too involved in defending the law as for now being impartial.
Kagan has given no indication that he will.
Boeing receives a record order of $18 billion
Emirates airlines request 50 Boeing 777 double corridor aircraft, with an option of 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner planes to Oman Air, an operation valued at over $1 billion.
Rarely is it news when a company gets an order of 50 units of its product.
But it's a big deal when the company is the manufacturer of Boeing Co. planes and the selling price for the 50 aircraft amounts to a record of 18 billion dollars.
It is as large as the place where Boeing received the order: Middle East, a gold mine growing from future orders of planes.
In a study on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that over the next 20 years airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion.
Boeing announced during the weekend his biggest order in history for commercial aircraft for its value in dollars - 50 Boing 777 double corridor jets.
The successful request came from the Emirates airline in Dubai.
The airline also has an option to buy 20 more aircraft, which would raise the total selling price to $26 billion, announced Boeing at the Dubai Aeronautical Hall 2011.
Then on Monday, Boeing said that Oman Air had requested six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, to assume fuel savings and spectacular passenger services.
The selling price for six of them is over $1 billion.
"This clearly has a huge positive effect for Boeing," said Morningstar Neal Dihora analyst.
"The quality of these particular customers is very strong."
Many Middle East airlines are owned by their oil-producing nations.
Therefore, they not only have the money to pay the planes, but an increase in fuel prices - usually detrimental to airlines, because it is one of the biggest costs - is not so detrimental, because the country is earning money with the increase in oil prices.
That is important because they are less likely than other airlines to cancel or delay flight orders when fuel prices rise, Dihora said.
"They have natural protection," he said.
The request of the Emirates solidifies Boeing's leadership in the wide-breathing aircraft market and helps keep track of the attempt of its competitor Airbus SAS to invade his domain with the passenger aircraft A350.
Boeing's victory at the air fair takes place four months after Airbus said he was going to delay the debut of the largest A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
He retracted the debut to add more impulse after customers required an increase in the payload and range.
Boeing Co's shares increased by 1.5% to $67.94.
The sister of the President of Mexico, apparently defeated in the vote of Michoacán
Luisa María Calderón states that drug traffickers helped his PRI opponent Fausto Vallejo in the governor's contest.
President Felipe Calderón's sister seems to have lost her candidacy to the governor of Michoacán during the election of the violent state, and she stated on Monday that drug traffickers helped to tilt the race in favor of one of her opponents.
The preliminary results gave the lead in the career for governor of the Western State to Fausto Vallejo, of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process and, especially yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoacán, but for the whole country," said Luisa María Calderón in a radio interview one day after the vote on Sunday.
"They threatened our candidates, our electoral workers... they took over the polls, installed barricades... and ordered the people to vote" in behalf of the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost its presidency in 2000.
However, it is the setting up of a return, and victory in Michoacán is an important step in that effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential elections in July.
Vallejo seems to have barely outstripped Calderon, who had led the polls before the elections.
Calderon, a candidate of the Conservative National Action Party of his brother, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the left-wing candidate for the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who currently holds the position of governor, remained third, a great defeat for the divided and unfortunate left before the 2012 presidential elections.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the preliminary results.
Vallejo, the mayor of the state capital of Morelia, denied links to drug trafficking and urged the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specialized in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
It is the birthplace of President Calderón, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive directed against traffickers in December 2006.
However, violence has persisted.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election while campaigning for Luisa María Calderón, and many candidates left the local candidates for fear.
Although for the PRI, however unpleasant the elections of Michoacán seem, a victory will help to drive the party.
The man who is supposed to represent the PRI in the presidential elections, Enrique Peña Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said, "I think this victory should be very encouraging, ahead of next year."
BASD urges Asia to help rescue the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (BAsD) has called on India and China to prepare themselves to help rescue the eurozone from its sovereign debt crisis to prevent a long-term recession that would prevent the growth of Asian economies.
Rajat Nag, Director General of the Asian Development Bank based in Manila, said that the two largest growth economies in the world had to "do everything possible" to accelerate the recovery of the economic bloc either through the International Monetary Fund or directly through bilateral agreements.
He warned against BRIC [Brazil, Russia, India, China] countries that observe Europe's difficulties in a "impartial" way and said that Asia's financial assistance along with European leadership and resources would help prevent a long-term crisis in the global economy.
"We're all together in this."
"So anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia can be protected to some extent, but it can't be immune."
"So if China and India can help, let it be by all means."
The European monetary union has been severely undermined by a sovereign debt crisis in recent months.
Over the last few days, Italian debt costs have been thrown dangerously and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The current sovereign debt crisis in Europe has increased fears that it could push the world economy into recession and have generated calls for major emerging economies to unite to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channelled through the IMF, but said that bilateral assistance - such as the purchase of EU bailout bonds, the European Financial Stability Fund - provided greater negotiating power for Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, Indian Minister of Commerce, said that "India will do everything possible" to help the eurozone as its own economy was now suffering the fall in exports and the exhaustion of foreign capital revenues.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We have monumental challenges and we have to maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not an option, it's a imperative, because where we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies like India have no responsibility to help rich Europeans when facing their own and profound economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be politically very difficult to sell aid to Europe for the billions of people from India, of whom up to 800 million live with about $2 a day or less.
"At some point they will realize that the Greeks retire at the age of 50 and go on vacation to the beaches and that will not fit," he said.
Lee Howell, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India's reserves should be used to maintain the numerous and well-paid Greek public sector workers, in jobs of poorly managed enterprises, and loss generators such as railways.
Mr Nag said that the eurozone crisis threatens "great chain effects" across Asia.
The forecast of the Asian Development Bank of 7.5 percent economic growth in Asia for 2011/12 is now facing the "downside risks" due to the threat of Europe.
He said that vulnerable emerging markets needed to make contingency plans to protect themselves from a crisis and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Several Pentagon warnings about possible defence cuts
The Secretary of Defense, Leon Panetta, warmed Congress on Monday, warning that the automatic budget cuts that follow could undermine national security and provoke a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon corridors, to the Afghanistan battlefields, to civilian assembly chains.
The Pentagon is already designing the $450 billion reduction over the next decade, but now it fears an additional 600 billion or more reduction in cuts that can be imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the department," Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, republican for Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, Republican for South Carolina.
He said that the failure of Congress to reach an agreement on the budget and its consequence, the so-called "rescue", would result in 23 percent global reductions and a halt to many new projects.
"A cut so large, applied in this indiscriminate way, would make most of our naval and construction projects cannot be executed - you can't buy three quarters of a boat or a building - and seriously damage other efforts of modernization," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We would also be obliged to withdraw many of our civilian officials in an involuntary manner and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, it is almost certain that we would have to license civilians in order to achieve the goal."
"These changes would break faith with those who maintain our army and seriously damage good will."
The cuts over time would reach the combat troops, Panetta said.
"Although the financing for wartime accounts in overseas contingency accounts is not directly affected by kidnapping, the efforts of the war would be negatively affected by the serious disturbances in the basic budgets," Panetta warned.
"The recruitment of staff would be reduced, leading to delays in contracts and the monitoring of the war-supporting contract."
"Payment personnel would be reduced, resulting in delays in payments to suppliers in time of war, and legal and political support would be interrupted."
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for information on the possible impact of automatic cuts on the Department of Defence.
"The consequence of kidnapping in the Department of Defence would cause a rapid decline in the United States as the world's largest military power."
"We are firmly against this draconian action," the senators said in a joint communiqué on Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
"This is not a result that one can live with, and certainly is not one that we should impose ourselves."
"The kidnapping is a threat to the interests of the United States' national security, and it should not be allowed to happen."
If the letter from Panetta and the recent warnings from the senators will increase the pressure for a budgetary commitment or intensify calls to exempt the Pentagon from the cuts is to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly frank about possible cuts, although she came to a job at the top of the Pentagon with years of experience in budgets at Congress and the White House and knowing she faced difficult decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defense painted a grim picture of what might be ahead - an army with a shell, but not a nucleus.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a bulletless brigade."
"It's an aerial wing without enough trained pilots."
"It is a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough soldiers trained to fulfill the mission," Panetta said in his opening words at the Pentagon.
"It is a force that suffers moral downfall, poor preparation and is not able to stay up to date with potential adversaries."
"In fact, he invites aggression..."
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta outlines new details of how reductions " generate significant operational risks: delay in responding to crises, conflicts and disasters; severely limits our ability to be deployed and previously committed worldwide; and poses an unacceptable risk in future combat operations."
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defence projects could face the axe, including those that are already being tested and some only in the early stages of planning.
This list includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter combat aircraft, a planned new bomber, the new generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal combat boat and the new ground combat vehicle that the Army and Navy need to replace, the humvee.
Stop development and additional F35 evidence could generate some $80 billion in savings over the course of 10 years, but its supporters say it is the next vital step to improve and address potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to detect a lie
A look at the most recent headlines tells us how serious and omnipresent deception and lies are in daily life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging allegations of sexual harassment with several women; each party accuses of lying to the other.
The administrators of the State University of Pennsylvania have been charged with perjury for allegedly concealing reports that a retired football coach was sexually assaulting children.
Last week, French President Nicolás Sarkozy was "piled" with an open microphone telling U.S. President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lying has destroyed careers and convulsed countries.
Congressman for New York and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made the ridicule with his defiances quickly challenged by the irrefutable test.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of infractions in funding the campaign related to the cover-up of an extramarital relationship.
And again, no one who lives will ever forget the media circus unleashed by President Bill Clinton by lying during his second term about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Legends about the traps in school and university exams are very widespread.
There have been cases where teachers have given the exam responses to students in order to be better seen in their performance assessments.
Mentors who should be teaching otherwise are sending the message that lying and deception are acceptable.
How much deceit do we have?
On any day, studies show that they can lie to you anywhere from 10 to 200 times.
That's for sure, many of those lies are pious lies.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes of meeting.
Detecting lies, or "the location of lies", is an essential skill that we must all acquire, for personal as well as professional reasons.
Far from being a board game similar to, for example, Charada, where the goal is to exclaim: "I have you", the detection of deception is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data obtained during the last six decades in prestigious universities that have conducted deep research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the investigation is that the old myths about the lie have been rebutted.
Liars do look in the eyes.
They don't always stutter, gossip, rub or worry.
Nor can it be concluded that liars are difficult to detect or unmask.
A trained lie detector can come to the truth by learning about the structure of the statement, microfacial expressions, the formation of questions and times.
I spent several years testing scientific discoveries about deception in the vast and always emerging body of knowledge, and it was clear that the detection of deception is a modern technique that is easy to learn and help to navigate through our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include recruitment, interviews, or negotiation management.
Good liars have the ability to read well to others, making them feel at ease, handling their own emotions and feeling intuitively how others perceive them.
We know from research that the extroverts lie more than the introverts, that men say more "lies oriented towards themselves", while women say more lies "orientated towards others" -- usually to protect someone's feelings -- that married people lie less frequently to their mates than those who are not married (but the lies they say tend to be "great").
We also know that if you are perceived as an evildoer, others will feel less guilty when lying to you.
How to know if someone's lying?
First, observe the usual conduct of the subject.
This is called "creating a baseline."
Helps provide benchmarks to measure changes later.
Observe the posture of the subject, laughter and vocal characteristic.
It's better to know if someone usually beats his foot all the time not to make unfair accusations when he sees his feet hitting in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for deceptive, verbal and nonverbal behavioural groups.
Consider these behavioural groups as warning signals, not as proof of deception.
People who cheat can freeze the top of the body by trying to remember their story, they can point their feet towards the door, lean towards an exit, change their position significantly, or exhibit a "post-interview eviction" -- that exaggerated sigh of relief and change of posture once all the difficult questions are over.
The interviewers often falsely see that the interview has ended only in search of that post-interview relief.
It also pays attention to the subject's vocabulary.
Scott Peterson stepped to the bottom and used the time ago as he claimed that his murdered wife was alive, launching a search for her at the national level.
People who cheat can also use a distant language: "I didn't have sex with that woman... Miss Lewinsky" or repeat a difficult question entirely.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "restrictive language" when answering a difficult question: "Well... to tell the truth... until I understand myself."
This makes the answer a perception rather than a fact and is often a warning sign.
There is no magic formula to detect lies, but developing skills to discover deception is possible.
These skills will improve the chances of anyone to avoid being victimized by scam artists in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial plan of the pipeline diverted after the threat of the US delay in its approval
Days after Obama's administration threatened to delay the approval of an oil pipeline planned from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- angering trade unions, as it appeased environmentalists -- the company that seeks to build the pipeline says it is willing to redirect the project to redirect it.
TransCanada said Monday night that it will move the planned oil pipeline out of the ecologically sensitive Sandhills area in Nebraska, and trusts that the project will gain approval.
The company announced the decision at the press conference in the Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada's director, Alex Pourbax, says the company maintains its confidence that the pipeline will eventually be approved, although it is true that with a different route.
This follows the announcement last week by the State Department that they would delay the decision by a federal permit for the project until new potential routes avoiding the areas of Sandhills of Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, a vast supply of groundwater, are being studied.
"This is a real way of making progress," said representative Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, to Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the State Department may separate any decision until 2013, after the next year's elections, although officials denied that the policy was involved in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the request of the State Department, and expressed his full support to them.
The 1,700-kilometre oil pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would take 700,000 barrels a day from Alberta province to refineries in Texas.
To that end, it would be necessary for him to cross six states.
It is hated by environmentalists, but loved by working groups, who have bet on the estimate of 20,000 jobs linked to the pipeline.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed to the plan are overstepping legislation to force a distance from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala aquifer, the largest source of drinking water and irrigation.
The Department of State's current environmental impact study found that the project only presented limited adverse environmental impacts, but the source of the energy industry said that the department's general inspector has ordered an independent proof of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is if the lobby member hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliot, who was Hillary Clinton's campaign advisor in 2008, represents a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is if a signature that was hired to conduct the original study was an inappropriate choice because it was linked to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle alleged to have caused a child to throw up in fear
A New York family claims that the diva of the disco music, Patti LaBelle, acted like a madman in the lobby of his Manhattan building, landing his little daughter to the point where she vomited out of fear.
The diaphragm of the singer "Lady Marmalade" frightened 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered " personality changes, sleep disorders" and "increased her fear of strangers," says her family in the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
It was November 10 last year when Tramoist Kevin Monk, his wife, Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were getting ready for a family trip.
While Kevin Monk took the car, Roseanna Monk went down to the lobby of the Riverside Boulevard building, with his luggage, taking Genevieve.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped by the door and put her daughter on the floor for a moment.
"Someone came back and said to me, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said "yes' and I went to get it," he said.
LaBelle reprimanded the pregnant woman.
"He said in an aggressive tone, "I shouldn't have left his daughter near the door," said Roseanna Monk.
"I said, "I have no interest in what you say or think."
He became angry and began to use bad words - word C and word J aloud...
He had a bottle of water and started throwing water from the bottle over me."
He said Genevieve became hysterical.
"I told this woman, "Look what you did to my daughter," said the girl's mother.
LaBelle shook over the mother -- who was still subject to Genevieve -- and had to be contained by her environment and withdrawn from a car waiting for her, Roseanna Monk said.
The little girl was crying so loud she vomited, she added.
Later, the family sent a note asking for an apology from LaBelle, but he did not get an answer.
LaBelle's lawyer and representatives did not return calls to comment on what happened.
The suit seeks unspecified damages, but family lawyer Sam Davis said he took the case for free and that the family plans to donate all the money that he gets to a support association for children with cancer.
"The purpose is to make Patti LaBelle responsible for his conduct," Davis said.
"This type of behavior is completely unacceptable, especially when it addresses a kindergarten teacher who carries an 18-month-old child in her arms."
Climate adversity halted the economy
During the first year of management of Mario López Valdez, Sinaloa has increased unemployment and informality, lowered foreign investment and contracted the economy
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of government of Mario López Valdez, self-denominated of change, which generated great expectations for progress in the economy, but given the climate adversity of the beginning of the year, there is no growth, instead there is a deterioration in the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures of February, in addition to causing millions of losses to the agricultural sector, limited the possibilities of the state economy to grow, caused a contraction in economic activity in general of 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, mainly justified by the historic fall of 31.16 per cent in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of the other economic sectors.
According to the report of impacts on the icelands, issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, damage was sustained in 582 thousand 835 hectares cultivated, of which 78.03 per cent suffered total damage and the remaining 21.07 per cent suffered partial damage, the main sinister crops were those of vegetables, corn and garb.
The fall in economic activity has generated, until November, a steady increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the rate of State unemployment during the first three quarters of the year was seen as an accelerated growth, since by January to March 55 thousand,053 signposters were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 per cent of the economically active population, for the second quarter the rate rose to 5.28 per cent, and between July and September the average continued to increase to 6.19 per cent, a rate that in number of persons dropped to more than 74,000 unemployed signposters, an increase compared to the first half of 18 thousand 969 individuals.
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, for economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the UAS Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences, the growth of unemployment can be explained indirectly, depending on the actions that have taken since public policy.
"What is being seen is a growth in unemployment which has to do with several factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market due to the effects of a restriction of resources by the legislation passed at the Congress to combat money laundering, and for people who seize dollars illegally it is not easy for them to work, invest and use them in something," he said.
Organisation
López Cervantes pointed out that there is also a demographic factor in increasing unemployment.
"The number of people leaving the state looking for work abroad in the United States has been restricted, first by the difficulties of entering, and secondly because entering already have many difficulties to find work, these people are staying and demanding sources of work here in the state, which causes unemployment to rise," he said.
Informality
The analysis of the signal labour market is aggravated by considering the high level of informality prevailing among working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 percent of the population employed in the state works without being listed as a worker before any social security institution.
Together with unemployment and informality, another of the state's job losses is low wages, the entity has the lowest wages in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Social Insurance Institute and the Ministry of Labour and Social Security.
The average monthly income of signal workers was, until September, 5 thousand 352 pesos, well below the national average, located at 7 thousand 375 pesos.
FDI contraction
Together with the fall in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, during 2011, the largest decrease in Foreign Direct Investment over the past 10 years is recorded, according to the Secretariat of Economy from January to June of the State FDI amounted to $630,697, representing a decrease of 87,74 per cent compared to the $5,143,312 recorded during the same period of the previous year.
For its part, the Secretariat for Economic Development of the State Government accounts for a total investment of 17 billion 280 million pesos per year, mainly from third-party companies.
Debt
In the light of the economic contraction scenario, the State Government requested in July the state congress to approve a loan of 3 billion pesos, even though investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities would be aimed at re-activated the economy, the approval of the local congress was of an amount of 2 billion pesos, and until November they did not observe the benefits of debt in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
For business sector representatives, Mario López Valdés' first year of government shows a lack of government management capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry, said that during 2011 there was a lack of harmonization of wills of the different sectors, including the state government itself.
"The performance of the economy in Sinaloa during this year has really been very poor, we must work hard to recover the land we lost this year, in 2012 we have to redouble efforts, we have failed to align the effort of everyone and above all the good march already synchronized of this new government team, we hope that next year will be much better," he said.
Economic slowness
Loredo López reported that events such as early-year ice cream stopped the state economy and restricted its performance and growth.
"The low economic flow is the product of several events, including ice cream, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that doesn't turn fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows us to have an acceptable level of flow in processes, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year, we are closing far below the expectations we had," he mentioned.
Redefine vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the National Confederation of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, he stated that it is necessary to bring the state into productive activities of greater dynamism.
"In general terms we have observed that it has been working, we believe it is necessary to develop a long-term programme in which the vocation and economic direction of the state is redefined, because it is important that all the potential of the material and human resource that Sinaloa has is depleted," he said.
Work to be done
The Chairman of the Coparmex stressed the importance of developing a vision for the future that better governs the efforts of the Government.
"In general terms, I would say that the Government has been working hard to achieve good results in different areas of economic development, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He pointed out that the current administration has shown progress in its conduct of public policy.
"There are elements that allow me to say that the Government is being more inclusive, I can say that there is work done and I think the Government is aware that there is work to be done," he said.
He's sentenced for 8 kg of marijuana.
A neighbor of Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in a fine for the possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Office of the Attorney-General of the Republic reported that the sentenced drug addict is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for the offence against health, in his variant of possession of marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to the file AP/SIN/CLN/68/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by elements of the Mexican Army, on 7 June 2010, in a surveillance operation on Cipriano Valdez Street, opposite the post 80, in the village of El Castillo, Navolato.
The narcomodist drove in a pick up truck, white, where he carried a black bag in the vehicle box and in the copilot seat a small backpack, where the military found eight kilograms 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the insured person was at the disposal of the District Second Judge and the sentenced person continues to remain in the Centre for the Execution of the Legal Consequences of Crime.
Must contribute to works
Social works contemplated in programmes such as Habitat, Public Space Rescue and 3x1 for migrants are at risk of not being completed or being seriously delayed due to lack of economic resources, Miguel Ángel López Miranda said.
The Director of Municipal Social Development indicated that although the work programmes have so far advanced, they are at risk because of the failure of the Government of the State to comply with the contributions of which they add a resource greater than 11 million pesos to the three programmes.
He noted that the total investment in these three programmes is nearly 50 million pesos, of which the State accounts for 25 per cent and that so far only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for the works, so that the possible delay in the conclusion of them is in effect.
"It's almost 12 million things to contribute to them and despite the fact that the year is about to end they haven't given us a fifth, when since July they had to give us a share," he said, "we've started the works so we don't delay, and they're very advanced, but we need the money."
He mentioned that last year, in the administration of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the State failed to comply with their respective contributions, so at the beginning of the administration the Municipality had to apply for a credit to cover the more than 7 million that the state administration did not provide on that occasion.
"It has already happened to us in the previous sex year because the State did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programmes continued to walk, and this year we had to obtain the resources to cover what the State had left behind," he said.
Despite the State authorities ' commitment to comply with the delivery of these resources, he commented that the request had been made to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to speed up efforts to ensure that the percentages corresponding to them were reached as soon as possible.
"It's almost 12 million what they have to contribute and even though the year is about to end they haven't given us a fifth."
Valid cut "analog blackout" in Mexico in 2015
Replacing analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) rejected the constitutional disputes brought by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against the presidential decree advancing the so-called "analogue blackout" from 2021 to 2015, not meeting the eight votes necessary to invalidate it.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers by issuing the decree detailing the actions to be taken to concreteize the transition to digital terrestrial television.
As a result, the constitutional dispute promoted by the Senate of the Republic was rejected because it did not reach the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and the decree remains in force.
The draft sentence, drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed to declare the decree unconstitutional because the regulation of radio and television matters is a power reserved by law for the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), contrary to the principles of hierarchical subordination and reservation of law.
In favour of the project, only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and the Sánchez Cordero themselves voted.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies promoted two constitutional disputes to challenge the decree, and by admitting the demands, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the implementation of the decree and all the actions in it arranged for the digital transition.
The plenary of ministers also decided to reject the request made by the Chamber of Deputies, without entering the discussion of the project, also by Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the President-in-Office said he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the Federal Executive could not structure through general rules the measures for the preparation of public administration.
"I also do not consider that if I did so, the autonomy of the regulatory body would be affected," and recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector corresponds to the Federal Executive, who has the constitutional mandate, the state's rectory.
Replacing analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years, and it translates into better use of the radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
To postpone the change, he said, would delay the benefits of digitisation, which involves a decision of public interest, which has not only a technical dimension, "for it covers economic, social, political and national security issues".
These issues, he stressed, “require the operation of the entire system established, in accordance with the principle of economic rectification of the State, includes a group of powers which the Constitution leads to the power of the state executive”.
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the digital transition, and has done so through the Executive, despite having highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, by issuing the contested decree, which somehow invades the area of competence of Congress, since compliance with the laws issued by the legislature is being provided in the administrative field.
They analyze the possibility of a vote count in Michoacán
According to the data released by the PREP, the difference between the first and second place of the election of governor is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total records.
The possibility of counting "vote by vote" is a reality with regard to this year's electoral process in Michoacán, where according to the data released by the Pre-Trial Electoral Results Programme (PREP) the difference between the first and second place of the election of governor is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total records.
In this regard, the President of the General Council of the Michoacán Electoral Institute (IEM), Maria de los Angeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, just on 9 November, the electoral body adopted a series of guidelines in order to harmonize local rules with federal electoral reform.
As will be recalled, Michoacán did not approve its Political Constitution or its State Electoral Code or its Electoral Justice Act, provided that the Congress of the State approved the reforms shortly before the end of the legal period so that they could enter into force in this electoral process and Governor Leone Godoy Rangel omitted its publication within the time limits set out in the Law of the Official Journal of the State, with the argument that he had some objections.
On the same November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional dispute promoted by the local Legislative Power and called as "invalid and illegal" the vote of the State representative on constitutional reforms, since he has no right to "sanction or veto them".
Interviewed on the possibility of the "vote by vote", Maria de los Angeles Llanderal explained that through the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of the EMI it will be possible to conduct partial and total polling accounts by the local electoral body.
In this way, the partial counting of votes, of one or more electoral packages, may be made on the assumption that: the results of the records do not coincide; there is no ballot and calculation in the case of the box or does not operate by the chairman of the register; or, where there are obvious errors or alterations of the records.
In addition, the total number of votes received in all the ballot boxes may be made when there is evidence that the difference between the alleged candidate winner of the election concerned and the one who obtained the second place in the vote is equal to or less than one percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the meeting there is the express request of the party representative and/or coalition that applied for the second of the nominated candidates.
The total vote may also be counted if at the end of the ordinary calculation it is established that the difference between the alleged winner and the second candidate is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that there is the express request of the representative of the political party whose candidate remained second, in which case the electoral packages which have been the subject of partial counting will be excluded.
It should be mentioned that in this situation there is the choice of Morelia, where according to the PREP the difference between the first and the second place is only 0.16 percent, although without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total records.

Felipe Bacio Cortés left the city of Saltillo very young to enter the Air College in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some did not believe it because they said that they were even navigating in the truck; however, he always tried to fulfill his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio recalls him as a very good person, "only in Saltillo was the whole family wanted to greet him, like the occasion he brought Martha Sahagun to Saltillo."
The young man recalls that even when he was seven years old, he traveled to Zapopán for the graduation of his family, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he liked most in life: flying an aircraft.

Locate three abandoned corpses on Cadereyta NL farm
Hours before the finding, the military authority presented to the media eleven persons who were detained in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found shots killed in different parts of the body and with the shooting of grace, on an abandoned farm in the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The finding took place at 1.5 km from the road from Cadereyta to Santiago, at the height of the community known as El Castillo.

The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has placed that country on the brink of the economic disaster
Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet on Wednesday with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of the economic disaster and has put the whole eurozone at risk.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet on Wednesday with President Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that he can form a government.
It is expected that he will present a cabinet composed mostly of technocrats, although it is unclear when the new executive will take over.
Monti said he will present to the president the outcome of his talks with the political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," the former European Commissioner told journalists.
Monti did not explicitly say that he could form a government but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles had been overcome.
"The frame is now well outlined," he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than normal, while Italy fights a political and financial crisis that has driven the costs of its debt at unsustainable levels.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package required by European leaders to regain the strong confidence in Italy.
Stressing the pressure on Monti to hurry, the instability of the markets placed the performance of the Italian BTP bonds at 10 years above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland were obliged to be rescued.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian employer Confindustria, told the press after meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government a lot."
We believe that this Government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this emergency situation.
Monti's chances of success were greatly driven by the support of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party, to which the crisis forced him to resign on Saturday.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti are meant to have a good outcome," he told the press Angelino Alfano, secretary of the mid-right party.
The support of the PDL, the largest party in Italy, is significant because so far many of its members have opposed the technocratic majority government that is forming Monti.
Parliamentary support
The new Government of Monti must have strong parliamentary support to implement what is likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockade or delay in its efforts could lead to a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks came under pressure to warn that a failure in Monti would be a disaster.
Monti began consultations on Monday with political parties, trade unions and business groups, as well as with youth and women's organizations.
It will end its round of meetings on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, who has enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief breath at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would resign, the costs of Italian debt have now returned to critical levels among uncertainty as to whether the new Prime Minister will succeed.
Rescue Italy, with a public debt of EUR 1.8 billion, would be too much for the current financial defences of the eurozone.
Monti has said that his government should last until the next elections, scheduled for 2013, despite the generalized predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement reforms before the elections are made.
Monti has said that he would like to include politicians in his office, but the big parties insist that it should be formed only by technicians, an indication of his repairs to a process bound by financial pressure.
Political sources noted that mutual mistrust and disagreement between parties are making it difficult to include political figures.
The roce of the Spaniards is superior to that of the tics
Of the 22 footballers called from Spain, ten outnumber the 50 international games.
On Costa Rica's side only one of the 22 called came to the 50 meetings.
A capital contrast to Costa Rica, if compared to the 22 called by both countries for today's friendly at 3:05 p.m., at San José National Stadium.
While world and European champions, number one of FIFA's monthly ranch, account for a broad record of class A games, Tricolor only owns the defender Michael Umaña as the only one with the 50 international parties.
This figure was reached on the previous Friday in the match against Panama (0-2), at the Rommel Fernández.
Spanish football players playing in the League of Stars and in powerful clubs of the League Premier of England maintain an intense activity every year in league championships and home cup, and high-level shocks in European Cups such as Champions League.
To the above is added the experience with the Spanish Fury in complicated eliminations of Eurocopa and the World Football.
The tic footballers, on the contrary, possess a limited international rock in an area, such as Concaf, which is considered the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the highest record of the Spanish Selection is from the archer Iker Casillas, who on the previous Saturday before England (fall 0-1 in London) equalized the registration of the exporter Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international meetings.
Casillas will play today in front of the Tricolor and will impose a new record for Spain of 127 internationalities.
Xavi Hernández, a Barcelona brain wheel, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi, even, were recognized the previous week by UEFA along with the other hundreds of Iberian team, the cited Zubizarreta 126 and the Schalke aries, Raúl González, 102.
Almost close to the centenary figure is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
He follows Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fabregas, with 61; and David Silva, with 53.
On the tic side, and near Michael Umaña, are left side Júnior Díaz, with 48 presences and artillery Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five passed the 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least.
More than 30 presentations in Spain include Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 presences, Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest isn't approaching at 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Victor Bolívar has only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson still do not start.
The historical goalkeeper of Spain is David Villa, with 50 dianes, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
By Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who records more with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country on his two-decade tour of history
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In an exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said the band is ready to offer one of its best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
They have been waiting for more than 20 years, but the band ensures that for them it will also become the dream of playing in the country.
This was said by the bassist and founding member, Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively with Viva from Brazil last week.
The grouping is located in the South American wing of its two-decade work celebration tour and on Sunday 20 will make its only scale in Central America.
That day will be presented at the National Stadium, beginning at 7:30 p.m., next to the Angeline band The X and the nationals of Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, whose complete transcript is in La Nation on the Internet.
For its Costa Rican followers, it is a dream come true that Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica, are you aware of what their fans are living?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is just our second time in South and Central America and so far it has been great.
I've been to Costa Rica only once and on vacation; it's such a beautiful country and I think we'll be able to stay there for a few days.
So we're excited to take our music there.
I ask you this because there is some kind of devotion to the band, fans live with intensity on the previous days.
What do they tell their most fervent followers?
Thank you for staying with us through all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so long and we regret that it took us so long to get there.
Some people even refer to their concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does that add some pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we've played over the last 21 years have happened over the last couple of weeks.
We played a couple of giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that it has brought us into shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we're really looking forward to playing there.
We love that country, we love surfing and jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is among the best in the world.
How did they discover Costa Rica and its surfing waves?
We have many friends who are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves there are amazing.
My friends were always going to surf in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, together with Mexico, they're great places to surf; that's how we found out, through people who love surfing.
Seeing the tour, they've been delivering huge shows with lots of songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
As we've never touched there before, then we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to give the best possible show with a good variety of songs; we will try to play a couple of songs from each album and give our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What's this for?
I think it's partly because we have nine albums and we can play more than 120 songs and each one likes different songs, so it's hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we haven't played, that keeps us focused and also makes us surprised because it reminds us of the reasons why we liked those songs and that we might have forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting to us and, therefore, I think it also makes it more interesting to people.
With this tour, they are celebrating 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything they've achieved?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I think none of us imagine that we would be in a big rock band and have done it for more than 20 years makes it look like a dream.
We continue to count our blessings and we are very excited that we can continue to make music together.
We all love each other and we love to create music.
We are fortunate to go to places in the world to which we always wanted to go.
Things couldn't be better for us.
What did it mean for you to have been a fundamental part of the grunge emergence?
It has always been an honor to be part of that group of big bands.
We are very friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and it is unusual.
From time to time, there is a band in a city, but it's much more strange when five or ten bands leave at the same time in a city.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on their tour, so we're lucky to be friends of all of them yet and honor us to be part of that Seattle sound that emerged.
It is also very strange for a band like yours to remain united and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which alone is much longer than many bands last.
First, I think we are all lucky to be still alive, and secondly, we all care about others.
We are all very close friends and, thanks to that, musical avenues have also been opened that give everyone freedom to experience.
We trust each other with each other's music and could not be better.
Your relationship with the word fame has not been simple; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do whatever you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we've been growing up, it's been easier to find a balance.
We make sure you're not too busy on tour because it's easy to fall into that game of great crowds and people who love your music.
While one remembers that people are there for music, it reminds you that you must respect the music and what brought it, without getting entangled for being famous and being a rock star, something that none of us really care about.
How do you remember your other Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote very good songs and at first it was something great.
We were a band for almost three years and never published a record until after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There was a lot of frustration because it lasted so long and most importantly we're still very friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started in the band with us and when I hear a song or I see a picture I think about the incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football and much more.
He was a surprising human being and we missed him.
The national band Las Robertas will be responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know your work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose it for the opening?
Yes, production sent us videos with several proposals and that was the band we liked most, so we are eager to see what Las Robertas can offer live and have to be very entertaining.
Why do they always change Yellow Ledbetter's lyrics live?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he does it with the first thing that happens to him.
As a bassist, what are your influences?
There are so many.
Among the first things I can think of are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I love.
How did Pearl Jam keep the grunge relevant even though it was no longer a fashion?
I think we all always feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands I mentioned earlier, such as Mudhoey, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all that came up at the same time, and, if there's relevance now, I think it's something wonderful because it's music that's worth listening to and bands like Mudhoney are now doing better music than ever.
At first, his music had a darker content and has now become more positive.
What does this change mean?
It's interesting because I think there are a couple of songs on the new album that may seem lighter, but there are also songs, such as The End or Just Breake that qualify as very dark songs although they may sound a little positive.
With both, when Ed touched me, I cried when I heard them and they were deeply dark songs.
I think that when you grow up and there's some trauma in your life and you lose a relative or a friend, those things start to influence your art and your music and those two songs, they certainly represent that to me.
Also, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make music that is dark.
Peru:
Fujimori is admitted again for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized on Tuesday in a public hospital to be assessed by the loss of muscle strength in his legs, his head doctor reported.
Fujimori, 72, who serves a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his government (1990-2000), suffers from several ailments, including cancer in the language for which he has been operated four times and remains under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal physician, told the TV channel N that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the reason for the pain and loss of strength of its lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate for the benefit of the pardon for humanitarian reasons, however, he said that he does not want it because he is known to be innocent.
It was operated four times as cancer in the tongue, has a weight loss of 18 kilos to which other diseases such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreas cyst, kidney calculations, hypertension and circulatory problems in the legs have been combined, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been in detention since September 2007 at the National Directorate for Special Police Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people by an army annihilation squad who operated clandestinely in the early years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official committee, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica, and composed of several ministers and entrepreneurs, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday in order to expand trade between the two nations and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican partner, Felipe Calderón, the highest point of an extensive agenda of meetings with political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the community of Uruguayan residents in Mexico, according to the agenda broadcast by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents, in the city of Guadalajara, will be "proper for the exchange of information in all the political affairs between the two nations," said the South American presidency on its website.
According to local media, Mujica would seek to get Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France when French representative Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country in a list of tax havens, at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that continue to be tax havens, a statement that provoked Uruguay's rejection and the call to consult its ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group composed of the most powerful emerging and developed countries in the world, and has been in force with the South American country, since January this year, an agreement to exchange tax information in order to avoid double taxation.
In recent years, the Uruguayan government has been trying to speed up the implementation of tax exchange agreements in order to get out of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) 's "gray list" made up of countries that did not implement all international standards of tax cooperation.
At the commercial level, Mexico and Uruguay have been in force since 2004 a Free Trade Treaty (CTA) which has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The moustache fountainer passes through the three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has struggled, tireless, over 25 years to save Princess Peach from the claws of the evil Bowser, but he had never done so so far in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of the girl in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which arrives this month at shops all over the world, has been designed from the beginning to take advantage of the characteristics of the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows to play in three dimensions without the need to use glasses.
"Mario is the character who has to say how stereoscopy without glasses should work," said Nintendo's specialist press manager in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Alvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game originally designed for that support", since so far successes such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo's spokesperson has argued that despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "accessible" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and fluid game.
Alvarez has stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to hook the less skilled users.
Once exceeded, the most experts will be able to take a "second round" at the levels of the game, which this time have greater difficulty.
In addition, users can choose in real time between an "D aggressive" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it will be necessary to play in three dimensions in order to overcome the different challenges and "not succumb to optical illusions".
This incursion of Super Mario into the three dimensions also involves the return of the character to a portable console, which did not occur since 2005.
In this video game Nintendo gives clues to the followers of the saga and repeats the formula for the success of previous deliveries, consisting of that the moustache's fountain will have to travel endangered platforms in order to release Princess Peach.
Although the player will find news in movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also a "playable" Luigi.
Colom endorses Portillo's extradition to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced this Tuesday that he was preparing for the extradition of former Governor Alfonso Portillo to answer in the United States for the conspiracy to wash up US$70 million.
This concludes the process for Guatemala to respond to the northern country's request for Portillo to judge him there.
At the press conference, Colom stated that his decision was due to the independence of judicial and executive powers, taking into account that a court of sentence had already ordered extradition.
He claimed that during his term he “did not put his hands” into judicial decisions and handed over all extraditions he has known.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Morocco will be extradited for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
This is done by Colom after all judicial and constitutional bodies were exhausted to prosecute the ex-mandator from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Court of Constitutionality (CC), Portillo must be extradited once it has resolved its legal situation in Guatemala and its human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted of Q120 million in the Ministry of Defence when he was president, which was the process that preceded extradition, but the Public Ministry appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was born to avoid falling into the marginality of untrained boys
The balance of the first 25 years of life of the social support institution Trinijove is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have been helped to overcome a difficult situation throughout this fourth century.
This adds to the hundreds of jobs currently achieved for this social group.
The anniversary served yesterday to balance an event held in the former factory of Fabra i Coats, attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was born in the district of Trinitat Vella in 1986 in order to help young people with little training, without work, with problems of degree or in a position to fall into marginality.
Yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu concentrated on a large number of heads of entities and institutions who have collaborated with the association in these 25 years.
The varied political representation, in full electoral time, showed the unitary character of the work carried out by Trinijove.
Together with the President of the Generalitat, Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, attended the act the former counselor of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragall, and the extensive mayor and current eco-socialist councillor Richard Gomà.
The current adviser to Social Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the director general of La Caixa's social work, Jaume Lanaspa, also came to the large room of Fabra and Coats.
But he said that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that the present one too is, but he added that the work done so far "is a good basis".
The president set Trinijove as an example to know how to fight the bad circumstances and give hope to people in difficulty.
"The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does," he said.
Dislodged an Okupada farm where they were making macro-fests
The invaders had taken 11 of the 13 floors of the building in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants left the farm yesterday noon without offering resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that the neighbors of the 51st of Balmes Street have come to an end.
Twelve people left yesterday's noon voluntarily the building that they were illegally occupying, where they organized macro-fests that were desperate for the neighborhood, by court order and without the need for police intervention.
When the operation was completed, the door lock was changed to avoid repeating the situation.
"From now on there will be access control," said the administrator.
The Okupas, which had invaded 11 of the 13 floors of the building - the rest are inhabited - took all the electrical installation and part of the water, besides painting the walls and leaving waste of all kinds, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
The first three floors were the stage of the crowds parties, which lasted up to two days and desperate for the tenants.
Next to the building is a disco, Balmes 51, which has also been damaged.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat explained to Europe Press that since the building was occupied the business has dropped by 80%.
The owner of the disco indicates that the invaders of the farm made him disloyal competition, as they sold the cups to three euros, while at the discotheque they were worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the entertainment venue had had to respond to neighbouring noise complaints, while, according to her point, the harassments did not cause them by the disco, but by the residents of the Okupada house and, above all, by the party attendees who were organized there, who had increased their frequency and intensity in recent weeks, according to the angry neighbors of the area.
The manager of the disco explained that the trouble was so great that he even reached an agreement with the owner of the property and nine months ago he "forgave" the rent.
The Urban Guard also confirmed that in recent weeks it has received more complaints from neighbours about the situation.
The president of the municipal group of the PP in the city council, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had claimed last week "to immediately unload the property to eliminate the problems of coexistence and civicism that produce the neighbours, as well as the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer there was only one plant of the occupied building, but over the past few months the Okupas had been entering all the floors of the building and almost all the floors, and that in some even there have been thefts.
In this sense he added that, "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to be determined against the incivisism that has been generated on the farm".
Also yesterday, the Mossos relocated a building in Nou Barris.
At 3.30 p.m., the police headed to 35 Mont-ral Street, after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed four persons accessing the building.
All four were arrested at the time.
Park or mountain?
Architects agree on the occasion of the call beyond the controversy over fees
The municipal competition on the 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the middle of the 80s, in the middle of the already extinct Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration printed some promotional pasquines of Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great park of the metropolitan Barcelona.
Moreover, he was accompanied by a comparison, in figures, with the New York Central Park.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park again stood, in the imaginary of many, as the upper limit of Barcelona, being the Catalan capital of the few that are not oriented in the north-south axis but above (mountain) -down (sea).
Collserola's rating as a natural park leads to this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with the wild boars on the Yogi bear's role.
In these were until, in September, the city called a mega-competition composed of 16 competitions for so many other access doors to Collserola.
A door refers to the idea of the park, no doubt.
Or that or someone intends to put doors to the field.
The question comes out alone: Collserola, park or mountain?
The competition, both because of its purely organisational aspect and what it implies as reflection on the city is the topic of conversation among all Barcelona architects.
It is almost already a recurring subject to be handed over when two members of this former caste of electors are recognized in an elevator.
And this fact is precisely one of the few coincidences between the views of three Barcelonean architects, and university professors, who have presented themselves.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modóol and Marta Bayona: the contest is timely.
For Roldán, after addressing the coastal front "it is necessary" to debate on "the mountain front", since the speech of Ildefons Cerdà, that of the green apples, has not been carried out.
"It can be based on the fact that the most extensive park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things because of its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex," says the architect for whom the title of "gates of Collserola" contains a "lexic trap": it is not necessary to think of them "like access to a park, but the delimitation of areas where it is necessary to act".
Modéol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, qualifies the proposal for "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers".
Dangers derived from the "uncertainty that it is today to project the public space" after the experience lived in the 80s and that it had in the area of the Forum "his singing of the swan".
The first fear is the very delimitation of borders on which it can be built.
"Limitating something is fixing the next step," that is, its overpass.
"There is a need to think about new urban planning instruments, because the current ones [referring to the Metropolitan General Plan (PGM)] can bring about real disasters."
More focused on the question, Modéol believes that, simplifying, the Vallesana aspect of Collserola "can be understood as a park, that of Barcelona, no", for a purely topographic issue.
Modéol recalls that there is already a work done by the Patronat de Collserola that "must not fall into a broken bag", although he appreciates the opportunity that the city council offers its support to intervene in this project "from the first moment".
And even more, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the safe conduit that allows the architects to enter the debate, but "doubt" about whether this technical profile should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("all a success," he points out) that they have had to create: "The architects should only be a tool".
Bayona insinuates that the answer to the question that gives title to this piece is complex, because at the basis of the competition there is a global view of Collserola: "16 cross-cutting contests have been called in the mountain-sea sense, but there is no longitudinal reading, which sees and understands the area as a whole".
This causes, at least in your case, that you have chosen to participate in the 16 invitations to tender.
Otherwise, a project for one of the doors may collide in program and definition with that of the architect of the door next door.
In his opinion, yes, the municipality should ensure that the band immediately above the Dalt Round should provide, in its entirety, an area of equipment that would make a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonah Larrazábal and will be free
After 72 days of roots, the legal holder of the Casino Red granted forgiveness to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey of the process that followed him for alleged blackmails
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the legal holder of the Casino Red has granted him forgiveness before the District Criminal Second Court, which follows a blackmail trial against the mayor's brother Monterrey.
After the attack on the Casino Royale, the owner of the Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, made public a series of photographs and videos in which Manuel Jonás allegedly demanded payment of an economic fee so that the city council would allow the clandestine operation of the betting house.
Following the public complaint, the State Prosecutor ' s Office opened a criminal proceedings against the Panist Mayor ' s brother, and on 2 September he was arrested and rooted for 30 days.
After four hours before the Public Prosecutor's Officer 3 in Heritage Crimes, he was transferred to the House of Root 1, located in the Old District of the State Capital.
At that place he remained for 49 days after being given a second warrant after the Public Prosecutor ' s agent had dismissed the crimes of cohecho and organized crime.
On 19 October, he was transferred to Cadereyta's prison for blackmailing the owners of the Casino Red with one and a half million pesos; however, he remained only a few hours in the middle-security prisoner as there were threats of death against him.
The authorities allowed him to follow the trial in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On 25 October, he was charged with arrest by the secretary of the District Second Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who said that almost two months after the investigation, sufficient evidence was found to determine Jonah's guilt, such as the 1.5 million pesos charged to the representatives of the betting company in return for the operation.
This Monday, the legal takeover of Casino Red, Victor Aldo García Gómez, came to judge José Luis Pecina to ask forgiveness for the brother of the mayor's royal office; so in the next few hours he could recover his freedom.
During the legal proceedings, the agent of the Public Prosecutor's Office attached to the Court, Ramiro Arias, questioned García Gómez if the damage had been repaired and who of the gambling partners was the one who granted the pardon, although the lawyer tried to reserve the name.
On the basis of file 197/2011, legal forgiveness is granted to Jonás Larrazábal, and no claim may be filed in respect of the following proceedings; besides that no compensation or punishment will be required.
Following the hearing of the legal takeover of the betting house, about 15:50 the immediate release of Larrazbal Breton was ordered.
The secretary of the Court, Jorge Yánez, moved to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolás de los Garza to notify Jonah that he has been legally forgiven and his file will be filed.
He shall also notify him of the order of immediate release issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionysio Pérez Jácome gives details of the air crash where the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake, and seven more people lost their lives
The Communications and Transport Secretariat (SCT) reported that the results dropped on the accident in which the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora, and seven others, lost his life indicate that the helicopter was directly impacted on the ground in full structural integrity, without the pilot being able to attempt a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionysio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that before taking off the aircraft, the pilot found that the weather conditions were adequate for flying.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the ground, the quotes had contact with trees 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage."
It also reported that the unit was designed for 19 persons, so it had the necessary requirements for transporting staff.
In addition, he said that research carried out in the impact area did not report the appearance of parts on the ground.
"In a search it is reported that there are no parts or components of the ship elsewhere, the impact was presented structurally.
"The helicopter's design was for 19 passengers, had suitable requirements for transporting passengers.
The terrain has a slope of seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
For the time being, the secretary assured that it is a priority with the results as soon as possible; however, research can last several months, even reaching a year.
For his part, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Airports and Auxiliary Services, assured that at the time of impact, the Presidential Major State helicopter operated at cruise speed and that this happened on a soft ascending terrain.
"This information strengthens the hypothesis of a normal cruise operation at the time of impact," he said.
At the press conference, the TBS holder, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
The flight was carried out under the visual flight rules in accordance with aeronautical regulations, which implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and the terrain.
Weather conditions:
The reports in the AICM placed adequate conditions for takeoff, as the aircraft advances towards the boundary area between the DF and the State of Mexico, low-level cloud layers were present.
Selected paths:
Due to cloud conditions, the crew may have sought a less elevated area and greater visibility towards the Cuernavaca Valley.
Location of impact.
The impact coordinates and the latest radar aircraft record coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration in the flight path.
Dispersion of aircraft remains in a reduced area:
The information available so far suggests that the impact occurred in a straight and side path.
The aircraft remains dispersion pattern suggests that the helicopter was impacted on the ground under structural integrity.
No evidence of fire or explosion has been detected:
At the site of the disaster there is still no evidence in the remains of the ship of any kind of explosion or fire.
The latest findings of the investigation indicate that he may have had multiple contacts with the field.
During the field work parts of the aircraft have been found at an elevation of 9 thousand 200 feet above the average sea level, the terrain has a slope ranging from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which it was expected to disarticulate throughout the course.
The information provides elements that appear to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts on the ground.
After careful search in a wider area than the agreed site, around the accident, no scattered parts of the aircraft have been found, which strengthens the presumption that the impact was presented under structural integrity.
MSS announces protocol to find obesity gene
Social Insurance Conducts an investigation to discover the obesity gene in children and young people; it is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) announced that it conducts a research to discover the obesity gene in children and young people, called the 'Genetic protocol of obesity in children and adolescents', which will allow them to have markers associated with overweight.
In a communiqué, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry of the Specialties Hospital of the National Medical Center 21th Century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionologists and social workers was integrated.
This team is supported by specialists and graduate students of the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The research invites the population to participate whether or not they are eligible, to visit the IMSS sports units participating in the Valley of Mexico, where the tests are carried out to minors every Saturday from 8:00 p.m.
He pointed out that the protocol began in the Quauhtémoc Sports Unit (State of West Mexico) and that since 8 October, the activity has been carried out in the Nezahualcoyolt Sports Unit (State of East Mexico).
Once the goal of gathering 500 or 600 minors is fulfilled, the study will continue in the Sports Independence Unit (south of the Federal District) and finally in the Sports Morelos Unit (northern of the Federal District).
He explained that the purpose of this research is to know the components and the importance of genetics with regard to the development of obesity and identify risk factors in Mexican children and young people to prevent the emergence of chronic degenerative diseases.
At the celebration of the World Diabetes Day on 14 November, he stated that the aim was to bring together 3,000 children and young people between the ages of six and 14, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the implementation of specific food questionnaires.
They will also be asked about the physical activity and family history of disease, in order to avoid risk factors that trigger diseases such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He detailed that Saturdays are applied to all participants anthropometric measurements (weight, size, waist circumference), blood pressure, blood glucose level determination, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetics (we seek to identify genes that are associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz López noted that this research is due to the concerns of health professionals about the alarming weight gain in minors.
'The 1999 and 2006 health surveys indicated that in just six years, there was an increase, in the case of children, of 77 per cent in obesity, and of girls of 47 per cent; in terms of overweight a dramatic rise was also observed', said the IMSS specialist.
He indicated that the justification for the search for markers is based on the fact that the country's population differs from others by their genetic history.
He reported that on average, Mexicans have 65 percent of Indian American heritage, 30 percent European and five percent African and this condition is reflected in genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that overall, the genetics of obesity translates into the inability to burn the excess energy that we consume (calories) and that is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants is the comprehensive assessment of children, allowing to detect whether they have any degree of overweight or obesity.
Even he said, the presence of dark-coloured folds (canthosis) in the neck and forearm, which indicate the likelihood of metabolic alterations and even predisabetes.
The information is handled confidentially, the doctors deliver it in writing to the parents, who are explained to each of the measurements and changes in the lifestyle they must make in order to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: sedentaryism, which is the lack of daily physical activity, remain most of the day sitting in front of the TV and use means of transport rather than walking short distances.
It is also due to high caloric intake, i.e. the increased consumption of sugar drinks, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburger, etc.) with high fat and protein content and the genetics analyzed in this protocol.
UNAM asphalt would avoid baccalaureates
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry of UNAM, develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with better performance, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signs sending the floor were taken care of, it would not be necessary to repair about 200 thousand baths each season of rain in the Metropolitan Zone of the Valley of Mexico, warned Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of UNAM, who ensured that if the process of building and maintaining an asphalt floor is adequate, the baths could be reduced in quantity or even completely eliminated.
In his lecture A technological opinion of the baccles, dictated within the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, revealed that the laboratory in charge develops asphalts modified with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of the asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera estimated that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, like some cities in the north of the country, to improve its performance and therefore the formation of baches.
He explained that asphalt, the heavier part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, high molecular weight molecules, called asphaltenes, and other low molecular weights, called Maltese, which together give the floor its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behavior of asphalt consists of that at high temperatures, about 180 degrees, behaves as a liquid, 120 degrees centigrade its viscosity is very high and 50 degrees centigrade has an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes brittle, he added.
The above means that in the streets the asphalt resistance is not uniform, but that it is changing during the day according to environmental and temperature conditions, warned the chemical engineering specialist.
The FQ researcher observed that the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered by flexible flooring, which consists of six layers of materials, of which the last three involve asphalt.
Among the most superficial layers is the asphaltic folder, made up of small stones bathed in asphalt and then compacted.
Each of the pieritas that constitute the folder, pointed out, is bathed with asphalt.
By transiting the vehicles and generating efforts, it allows forces to spread very well on the floor.
If it were modified asphalt, it would spread even better, said the chemical engineer.
On the asphaltic folder, it abounded, placed a last layer called a bearing folder, which is made of a fine stone material, i.e. a sand that is also bathed in asphalt.
Since it is the layer that will be in contact with the wheels of the vehicles, it must have more mechanical force than the asphalt folder and provide friction on the road.
Being the part of the floor that will receive and disseminate the efforts, the bearing folder also requires the appropriate thickness and the material to be taken care of is to be taken care of.
The climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, is also a very important factor to consider, especially water, said, because it significantly affects the performance of the asphalt folder.
When the soil is moistened, the water spreads inside the folder and it is difficult to get out, this causes a re-balancing of all layers of the floor and therefore the formation of baches.
In the process of forming a boat, he said, the first to wear is the rolling film and only afterwards is affected by the asphalt folder, but the damage does not happen instantly, but it is a process that should be addressed to the first signals with appropriate maintenance programs.
The member of the National Research System explained that the vehicle load is another important factor in the formation of baccalaureates and, therefore, the thickness of each layer of the floor should always go in relation to the vehicle load and ensure that it is fulfilled, in order to avoid frequent baccalation.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to be done to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, asphalt emulsions, which in other countries are already on the market and allow to repair the bags easily and without the need to use high temperatures.
What did the Valle candidate miss to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that affected Melina Ramírez Serna did not reach the crown of Señorita Colombia.
The Valley receives its title number 14 of princesses.
Once again, the Caucasian Valley is left with the wishes of the crown of Señorita Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to settle for being in the winning podium, polishing the silver crown and the band that accredited her as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where the Atlantic Miss Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Dominguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorraine Alvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanca (1988), Monica Evers (1989), Maria Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcès Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
Today the big question many are asking is what was missing?
Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite that at each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, not in vain was elected Queen of the Police and Best Jolie Face of Vogue, titles that obtained queens such as Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that is considered key in the jury's decision to appoint her First Princess is that she did not agree with her answer to the question "What is that book that has marked you and why? made by Martín Murillo Gómez, of the Literary Carte Leamos.
To the interrogator, the Caucasian valley replied:
"I read a lot, I believe enough in literature, I think it's a way of culturalizing, I definitely think that the book that marked me from childhood is "The beginning," is quite a deep book.
I currently read "Crimen and Punishment", it is a book of universal literature that we must all read; and today I am reading the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book called "The Burning of Blood."
A response that did not like first the term "culturalize" and second because it does not explain in a concrete way how each of the books quoted have marked it.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina expressed her calm and happy with the result "the universe is wise whatever has to happen.
And for everyone, please read a little, "The Beginning" is a great book."
Among the hypotheses launched, it is said that Valle was burned by favoritism.
A Bogotano journalist insinuated that by being the favorite, the ovationate and the candidate who held all the preliminary awards (Oster gastronomy challenge, public vote for the best craft costume, and Queen Mother), "he aroused the zeal of the other candidates, stressed the queen and therefore did not shine on the stage."
And that was noted in his first presentation in bathing suit on Hilton Beach and his two parades on the coronation evening.
Although he struggled safely, he was found lacking the strength and momentum that the representatives of Magdalena and the Atlantic had shown.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program "How at Home", of the RCN Channel, said that the fact that Melina was appointed princess "see that the most successful candidate during the competition does not remain queen."
In addition, Valle showed itself to the last very dodge with the press, and there was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury about its interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
For something, two days before the election, the international jury Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social needs of their parents.
"The beauty alone is not enough in a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond the physical and focus on your social sensibility, which before entering the Competition are already involved in projects," he explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned because of her defects in the back and fibrosis that was noticed in her abdomen, but it is contradictory because precisely the jury chose her as the candidate 'Natural Beauty' with the healthier body, good food and responsible physical work.
Queens preparer Jorge Hernán Orozco acknowledges that Melina did not have the best body, which was better, "but her problem of fibrosis in the abdomen, that the truth for me was not very well known, dropped points on the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of Cromos magazine considers that the error of the vallecacana was the surgical interventions practiced.
"Surgeries are fine, but Valle wasn't able to do them.
His body was never his strength and it was collected here."
For this prize, which for the first time gave birth to the National Beauty Competition, after the show in bathing suit a cruel vitinium arose last night, as it was said that this was the contentile Raymundo gave Melina not to give her the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina has begun a year of reign since today, not as sovereign, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international certificates by designation of the National Competition itself.
However, she will pass to history as one of the queens who, despite her rolling passage through Cartagena, was spared her crown.
So was the work of the master who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A clofoscopeist from Cali passed to history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these staff members is key.
On November 4th, a clofoscopeist from Cali's ITC passed to history as the man who confirmed the identity of the FARC's top leader: "Alfonso Cano", through the cottage of his fingerprints.
Of the seven Lophoscopists working in the ITC section, that week he played the "availability" shift to Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has worked in the judicial investigation area for 21 years.
When he began his career, González worked in municipalities of the Chocó, where he often had to stay in the jungle for more than five days to reach the place where the corpses were to be identified.
In 2000 he moved to the capital of the Valley and, after taking the corresponding courses, specialized in loposcopy, which is the study of friction skin, that is, palms of hands and feet.
The week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano to Eliazar warned him to wear minimum clothing for three days.
Something big was waiting for you.
On Friday night he left for the Cauca on a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew he should identify two corpses and that one of them was suspected of being one of the men who led the oldest guerrilla in the world, so they asked him to carry Guillermo León Sáenz's decacticular card (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the research team at the site where the body was located, he did not recognize it because of its physical appearance, since it was very different from what he had seen in the media.
He was without a beard, dressed like a peasant in the area, without glasses and much thinner.
But the prints don't lie.
Accompanied by a galtonian lens, ink, a transplanter and a flashlight, Eliasar compared the fingerprints of the body with those of the card.
His eye did not fail him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man coming from Puerto Tejada was responsible for confirming to the Minister of Defence, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that he was the chief of the Farcs.
In search of the fingerprint
For a fingerprinter of the Sijín de Cali the recognition made by President Juan Manuel Santos to Eliazar González, in the press conference for the operation against "Cano", is very significant.
Many people don't know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an accurate science, without any margin of error, which can become key to solving crimes.
Apart from the identification of corpses, Lophoscopists support investigations into crimes such as theft and murder and confirm the identity of the captured persons.
When captured, many criminals have false IDs or no papers.
We take their fingerprints and search them in the database.
The investigator told him that, in a case of theft, he was moved to remove a piece of wall from a house, for in that place the thief had supported his hand to pull out a strong box full of jewelry and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not suitable surfaces for fingerprinting, but in that case we could get the mark from all hands and identify the offender, who had participated in various thefts," he recalled.
The fingerprints can also rule out or reaffirm suspects in cases of murder.
They recently found a dead man with bottles of liquor around him.
Through the investigation it was determined that a family member could be suspected of the crime and, indeed, a mark on the bottle coincided.
Although this does not guarantee that he was the killer, it does place him on the scene of the crime.
A CTI fingerprinter explained that in the objects "the prints are extracted with chemical or physical reagents".
When they appear, a transplanter or tape is used to lift them.
After this, the impressions are sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the Registry.
"The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians," said the ITC expert.
He clarified that not everything is as shown in the CSI television program.
Just as not everything that shines is gold, not everything that is played becomes footprint.
However, if it can be used, if it is performed the respective cottage.
The "indignified" challenge the authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators flocked in front of Zuccotti Square to camp.
A large part answered the eviction order and moved to a nearby paruqe.
The members of the Occupy Wall Street movement challenged the New York authorities on Tuesday by trying to enter again, under a court order, at Manhattan Square from which they were left early in the morning and trying to occupy another Grand Manzana Park.
Hundreds of demonstrators flocked to Zuccotti Square, where they wanted access to a court order that allowed the "indignants" to re-camp in the place, while another part of the movement responded to the eviction by occupying a park further north of the city, where there have been new arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to re-camp in the square, we will settle somewhere else and continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, as well as through peaceful sittings and demonstrations," said one of the spokespersons of the "Occupa Wall Street" movement, Mark Bray.
Bray explained that the response of the "indignant" to the eviction of his camp, personally dictated by New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, came to the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting forced evacuation of the place and allowed demonstrators to remain camped.
In addition, the "indignant" proceeded to occupy a new park located in the confluence of Canal Street and the Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland tunnel, which unites New York and New Jersey, and property of the Trinity Church parish.
At least for an hour they managed to occupy the place, but then the police came and proceeded to arrest some of the protesters, although Bray was unable to confirm the concrete figure, while he assured Ephège that he saw several journalists who were also handcuffed.
The organization assures that several hundred people had been installed at that point, where a delegation of religious leaders had already been displaced in support of the members of the movement and had tried to mediate with the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square - which is a private-owned building - remains closed pending a judicial hearing scheduled for this same Tuesday in which the legality of the evacuation of this morning should be analysed.
Some of the demonstrators so far carried and distributed copies of that court order to these hours and even handed them over to the agents who were guarding the square, which led to "some small clashes," said Bray, who reported that some officers had proposed strikes to the protesters.
The court order prohibits the authorities from dislodging the members of Occupa Wall Street or applying "laws that were issued after the occupation began or prohibit demonstrators from accessing the park again with shops or other properties they used previously."
Mayor Bloomberg pointed out to the press that, because of this court order, the city had suspended the reopening of space to the public and the demonstrators, to whom he warned, however, that local laws do not allow them to re-install themselves with tents and sleeping bags.
The registrar personally defended the eviction of Zuccotti Square early in the morning, an operation in which about 200 arrests were carried out and which was decided because the protesters were "violeting the law".
Bloomberg explained that he gave the order to evacuate the square because it was becoming "in a place where people did not come to protest, but to violate the laws and, in some cases, to harm other people", because "some businesses had received threats" and the neighbors feared "because of their quality of life".
"The eviction of this morning was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is more interested in preserving the financial interests than those of American workers," added the spokesman for the movement, who accused the mayor of "missing respect for freedom of expression."
The "Occupa Wall Street" officials also indicated that they intend to organize "great actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community and trade unions, to commemorate the two months that the protests lasted, which began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary on a special television holiday
Together with Michael Bublé and other Canadian leading players, he will appear on the television program "It's to Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st
Canadian Pamela Anderson has been Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", assisted in "Baywatch", "Playboy" co-directed, the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary on a Canadian TV Christmas special.
The private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, along with the "crooner" (baladist) Michael Bublé and other Canadian prominent people, will appear on the television program "It's to Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1 giving life to a very particular Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed images of the television program in which Anderson, also known for the wide Internet distribution of a pornographic home video in which he appears together with his then husband, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appears dressed like the Virgin Mary holding in a manger a doll representing Jesus.
On the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comician of Indian origin who recently acted as a presenter in part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" tour, appears as José.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, CTV's special Christmas has Canadian singer Bublé, who married in Buenos Aires at the end of March with the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato, and who is not strange to the controversy.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian "sow" during one of his concerts in New York City.
Japan reindeer after the earthquake
GDP grows 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and puts an end to the spiral of falls that began in March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, still convalescent by the devastating earthquake that has become a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster Japan has suffered since World War II.
The Government of Tokyo ' s first estimates amounted to $300 billion in material losses, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, appears to have been mitigated.
After three consecutive quarters of falls, the Gross Domestic Product data between July and September served to move on, definitely: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% at an annual rate.
The second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also represents the highest rate of growth from January to March 2010.
Recovery is partly explained by the resurgence of the purchase of machinery to restore the areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1 per cent, compared to the decline of 0.9% in capital expenditure observed from January to March, the first downturn after six months of uninterrupted climbs.
However, the true repulsiveness of the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Keynesian impulse that invites to take advantage of the crises to strengthen - or rebuild - infrastructure, to use the shortcomings to grow from scratch.
Japan has awakened, above all, thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable rose by 1%, driven by increased expenditure on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo has been entrusted to the internal market, when the yen - the Japanese currency - has become one of the "refuge values" chosen by investors fleeing the debt crisis in the euro area and the troubled US forecasts, a privilege that weighs like a coward in the accounts of the exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products are more expensive abroad, a serious reversal for a country whose economic float line is determined by the health of the major technological groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, found their weak results between July and September to the Yen's contribution.
While the markets continue to be besieged by the peripheral countries of the EU, the Yoshihiko Noda Government does not pay attention.
"There is a need to pay attention to the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of Thailand's floods and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said yesterday, Secretary of State for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
And, indeed, prospects are not encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) specified that the majority of member countries presented clearer signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates inflection points in the world economy highlighted that the major powers are slowing down.
Since it dropped four tenths to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 August.
The euro area was even below the average, which is at level 100, by falling eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens once again feeds on doubts
Papadimos says the adjustments will be approved, but the conservatives will not sign any written compromise
With the peripheral risk premiums fired and the uncertainty resettled in the parks, Greece continues to be entangled in the maze leading to the outbreak of the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Greek Transitional Government is more imposed by the requirements of Brussels than by genuine political conviction begins to be confirmed by facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there was no alternative for structural reforms and that the hundred-day period agreed in his appointment might be short to implement them, conservative party leader New Democracy Antonis Samaras assured that he would not support new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections for the scheduled date on 19 February.
"The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the summit of 26 October," Papadimos said yesterday, opening a parliamentary debate that will conclude tomorrow with a vote of confidence to the new Executive.
A package with 24 programmes to boost employment, reform of the disciplinary code of officials and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras' message does not express any doubt about his position: "We have committed ourselves to helping the transitional government, but we have not committed ourselves to anything else."
The conservative leader was a step further in his pulse to the EU and the IMF, the agencies that must unlock the 8,000 million that Athens urgently needs, and made it clear that he will not give his visa to any letter of commitment to comply with the adjustments.
But the European Commission, which is still aware of the impact caused by the Papandreu referendum order, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not unlock the aid if the new Government and the leaders of the main Hellenic parties do not sign "a written commitment without ambiguity and as soon as possible".
The spokesperson for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the Troika inspectors will return "very soon" to Athens to discuss with the new government "what is needed to pay the sixth instalment" of 8 billion, although there is no definitive date.
The Greek wood still has thread for a while.
Madame Sofia: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights Spain's "preponderant" place in relation to this type of finance
Spain "has reached a dominant place at the global level in the role of Microfinance".
Queen Doña Sofia recalled yesterday that the country has become in these last two decades the second donor of the proposal in relation to this instrument of cooperation, whose "essence" stated that it is a "tool for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity, based on trust in human beings".
The Queen opened yesterday the Fifth World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the conviction that "there is no doubt" that this type of operation is "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the Millennium Goals established by the United Nations by 2015 horizon, and, "very especially, in that it aims at halving the volume of people living with incomes less than one dollar a day, with which the "poor threshold" is set."
Spain "keeps working" to expand the network of beneficiaries "to every corner of the planet, and takes on this task with "responsibility," said Doña Sofia, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions that originate at the Summit, which will extend until Thursday, "will guarantee the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest, and especially for women", the main beneficiaries of these loans.
They are "many of the achievements achieved" and "many of the challenges we face."
The Microcredit Summit presents itself not only as a forum for discussion, but also as the platform from which to promote "two basic goals".
Thus, His Majesty explained that it is expected that by the end of 2015 there will be 175 million poor families that have accessed these financial services and that hundreds of millions of these households will emerge from the poverty line in which they are submerged.
The momentum in the conception of microcredit in Spain and the rest of the world "has followed the path begun years ago in a pioneer way" by Muhammad Yunus, highlighted Doña Sofia as an "act of justice and due recognition".
And he described the father of this tool as "admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", whose work he has known for 15 years, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to learn about her lending policy on the ground.
This experience was followed one year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada 2006, and "in all I have been able to see the continuous evolution," explained His Majesty, whose connection to this project earned him yesterday the qualification of the "family head" gathered in Valladolid by the "baquero of the poor".
Finally, Queen Doña Sofia concluded her intervention by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for every democratic state.
In this regard, he explained that it would be an error to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic good, since it is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez considered that microcredit means "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to eradicating poverty", and now "more than ever" developed country governments must work under solidarity criteria and not let it fall victim to cuts.
For Spain, microcredit consists of "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
For its part, the Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, applauded "the success" of giving "trust" to people "excluded from those who all close the doors"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present to a city that "opens its doors infected with the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the European President by universal suffrage
On the first day of the Congress of the Christian-Democrat Union (CDU), on Monday, 14 November, in Leipzig, it has been without great difficulty for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and President of the Christian-Democrat Party.
Initially, Europe's future had not been included on the agenda, but the issue was imposed in autumn, in particular to satisfy militants who believe that the government's policy is currently too narrow with the Greeks and could be too strict in the future with the Italians.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the management, was adopted practically unanimously.
Of the 1,001 delegates, only nine votes against and ten abstentions were recorded.
The standing ovation of several minutes won, with its interventions, Angela Merkel and, after several hours, Wolfgang Schäuble, the Europhil Minister of Finance, clear any possible doubts.
The key idea of the Chancellor, and of the motion, is summed up in a motto: the response to the crisis "is not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe represents peace, but also because "nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro".
For the Chancellor, "the time has come to open the way in Europe".
This could be manifested in amendments to the Treaty of Lisbon to enable the European Union to strengthen its control over the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, although it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage to "make Europe a face".
In any case, that is one of the motions adopted by Congress, clearly the idea of Wolfgang Schäuble.
It is certainly unlikely that the twenty-seven will quickly reach an agreement on this radical change: Britain is hostile to it and the leaders of the CDU seem to know that Nicolas Sarkozy too.
But the ball is on the ground.
On the other hand, delegates have rejected the proposal by a overwhelming majority to weigh the weight of each country in the directive of the European Central Bank on the basis of the weight of each economy, which would obviously strengthen the weight of Germany.
Looking forward to calming the moods within her party, the Chancellor has increased the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. But it is also that she has tried to win her congress at the expense of the "small" European countries or countries in difficulty to criticize the arrogant Germany.
Although the motion on Europe devotes a section to the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel has not mentioned France.
Except for the past.
Recalling that two centuries ago, a bloody battle took place in Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats for Napoleon's army.
The incidence of fraud in sickness reductions
Following the grants, the UMP and the Government undertake an offensive against disease casualties.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 November to visit a box responsible for family allowances and deliver a speech on the subject, already recurring since 2007, of the fight against social fraud and aid.
In addition, in order to accompany such an offensive, which is part of the willingness to save rigorously, but still recalls an axis of the presidential right-wing campaign, most want to focus on disease casualties.
First, in order to implement budget cuts: the Government plans to impose a fourth day's shortage on private sector workers before they can take the fall.
In short, unless there is a specific business agreement, a worker who falls ill would lose four days' wages, i.e. a minimum of 15% of his monthly income.
This is a measure that could raise a wave of anger, but would save EUR 280 million, according to Les Echos.
In addition, it would be accompanied by another measure with a more symbolic scope: to impose a day of non-remuneration in the event of unemployment (to date, they are not lacking, compared to the three days that apply in the private sector).
While these issues are being discussed, the majority again put the issue of fraud on the table, this time oriented towards the abuse of low-employment.
"The controls will increase considerably, and if someone is found committing fraud, he will have to refund the amounts," Xavier Bertrand said speaking at RTL on Sunday, November 13.
As in other cases, the effects of the announcement seem slightly disproportionate to the reality of low-employment fraud.
In fact, since 2002, there has been constant follow-up to this issue and a number of political offensives have been launched, which have usually been successful.
The French are no more ill than in the rest of Europe.
Let us pay attention first of all to national figures.
According to the French Social Security Institute (CNAM), more than EUR 237 million was paid in 2006 for low-employment benefits.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in the Health Economy, low subsidies accounted for 5 per cent of health expenditure in 2008 and amounted to EUR 11.3 billion.
Of this sum, 46 per cent corresponds to maternity leave and occupational accidents, while 54 per cent is related to sickness leave, which amounts to €6.2 billion.
Consequently, 2.5 per cent of health expenditure.
In 2010, the French took an average of 14.5 days off from work, compared with 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
An average that no doubt conceals deviations: another survey, published in 2007 by the Syrian professional management Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed claimed that they had not taken a single day off by illness.
Another study, in this case of sickness insurance, indicates that in 2010 37 per cent of the sick leave was less than 8 days, 22 per cent between 8 and 14 days, 15 per cent between 15 days and one month, 15 per cent between one and three months and 11 per cent were longer.
If we compare them with our European neighbours, French workers are no more likely than in other areas to catch sickly casualties.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers indicated that, between 1994 and 2001, the overall absence rate (both for health and other reasons) was between 10% and 11 per cent in France, compared with 20% and 28 per cent in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or between 16 per cent and 18 per cent in the Netherlands.
Fraud in disease reductions is not particularly significant compared to undeclared work.
Fraud has a rather limited scope.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has led to systematic controls of sick leave over 45 days.
In 2008, of 1.5 million inspections, CNAM found, in 13% of the 285,000 carried out, that short-term reductions were "unjustified or too long", i.e. 37,050 cases.
In the case of falls of more than 45 days, subject to systematic inspections, it was considered that 11 per cent of the cases were "adequately adapted or unwarranted; a figure of 1.2 million, with departure, amounted to 132,000.
Thus, a total of 169,000 "unjustified" cases are reached among several million workers who have taken a sick leave.
Undoubtedly, a small figure compared, for example, to black work.
According to UMP Member Dominique Tian, author of a report on this issue in June, this practice would represent tax revenue losses of between 9,000 and 15,000 million euros a year, that is, more than the total cost of low subsidies and, no doubt, considerably more than fraud in this latter area.
Papademos: Greece will have to implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment plan to address its economy.
This is what Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos said to Parliament on Monday, 14 November, and added that the 100 days granted to his union government would not be enough to achieve that goal.
"To make efforts leading to economic recovery, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme," said the Head of Government, who delivered his first public address during the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken during the Eurozone Summit on 27 October will be the "primary task" of the new government, since "the country's stay in the euro area is at stake," he added.
As a result, Papadémos has predicted that the country's public deficit will be reduced "to about 9%" of GDP by the end of the year, after reaching 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
Right rejects new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the head of the right-wing group, showed Monday his support for the measures already adopted to try to get out of the debt crisis, but he has warned that his party will not commit to additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote in favour of further measures," he said during a meeting with members of his party "New Democracy".
He pointed out that he agreed with the objectives of reducing deficit and debt, as well as combating waste, but against any policy that impedes economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the necessary EUR 8 billion loan without a written guarantee of the support of all parties to the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his word would be sufficient and that he would not sign anything because of external pressure.
An expert committee states that euthanasia and assisted suicide must be legalized
Canadians live by denying death, according to the report of the Royal Society of Canada
With regard to palliative care, the Committee calls for Governments, health-care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, not only in cases of cancer.
Canadian society lives by denying death.
In fact, only 9% of Canadians are willing to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make arrangements for that purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an imposing report by the Royal Society of Canada, which included the participation of six experts from various areas, including ethics, legal and medical.
This committee recommends that the Government amend the Criminal Code so as to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, when the patient raises this option and has been judged competent to take the decision.
To begin with, experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit that compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada occupies tenth place, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has generated a culture in which people are afraid to deal with the issue of death."
With medication or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to experts selected by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the fact that most Canadians want to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying at the hospital.
Overall, the highest rate in this regard is recorded by Quebec, where 86% of deaths occur in the hospital.
With regard to the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report reached conclusions that are inconsistent with the Federal Government's position, which has already stated that it does not wish to amend the Criminal Code in relation to euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to experts, which have also studied the situation in all countries where such practices have been legalized or do not constitute a criminal offence, there is no evidence that the fact that they are not considered a criminal offence has not resulted in an abuse of their application, i.e. the use of euthanasia or assisted suicide with persons who are not competent or who have not given their consent.
Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, claimed yesterday by teleconference that, on the contrary, there were more excesses in those countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide have not been legalized.
"In Canada euthanasia is practiced, although it is clearly illegal."
"In Canada assisted suicide is practiced, although it is clearly illegal," Jocelyn Downie explains.
Canadians, in favour of euthanasia
Let us remember that 85 per cent of Canadians have already spoken in favour of euthanasia, as they believe it would allow people whose death is near to alleviate their suffering, according to an Angus Reid survey conducted in 2010.
In addition, 66 per cent believe that legalizing euthanasia will not imply that the lives of older or disabled people have less value.
As for those who have committed assisted suicide, 41 per cent of respondents believe that a process should not be initiated against them.
With regard to the maintenance or interruption of health care for a patient, the situation is not as clear as the authors of the report indicate.
Furthermore, among its recommendations, it suggests that the Criminal Code states that the withdrawal of health care, if legally rejected, does not constitute a criminal offence.
The Committee of Experts also requests that health professionals be trained to respect the fact that a patient rejects assistance at the end of his life without fear of dealing with a complaint.
With regard to palliative care, the Committee calls for Governments, health-care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, not only in cases of cancer.
Finally, in relation to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in the health institutions of Canada, the Committee requests that, unless it serves to reduce physical pain, it be considered euthanasia and subject to the same procedures.
Other experts express reservations
Other health law experts have already expressed their reservations regarding the findings of the report of the Royal Society of Canada experts.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has described as "extreme" the position of the experts who sign the report, among other things because the practice of euthanasia is not limited to the terminally ill.
"This leaves the door open to a situation in which someone who is tired of living and over 18 years of age can ask for help in committing suicide," says Deschamps, who consulted yesterday a summary of the report.
Mr Deschamps also pointed out that the authors of the report seem to give priority to personal autonomy over any other value of society.
However, he adds that "in society, there are labels and limitations".
The health law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed her "strong opposition" to the findings of the report, which she called "manifest for euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, who also belongs to the Royal Society of Canada, particularly questions the lack of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, as in the Netherlands and Oregon.

The partisans of Bachar El Asad protested yesterday in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs building.
Yesterday the diplomatic pressure on Bachar El Asad's Syria intensified, which, with Russia's support, resists and denounces that there is a "competence" against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union has strengthened the sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, neighbours of Syria, have expressed their support for the abandonment of power by President Asad.
King Abdalá II of Jordan was yesterday the first Arab leader to ask President Bachar El Asad to "put off power" in Syria, where a forty-six civilians and members of the regime's forces have already died.
"If Bachar really cares about his country, he should resign, in addition to creating the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," said the King of Jordan, a neighboring country in Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
For his part, Turkish diplomat Ahmet Davutoglu has regretted that the mediation efforts he has been making since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have ended in failure.
"Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said, referring to Syria, a neighbouring country where Turkey is taking an increasingly tough stance.
For its part, following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union, the United States has concluded that the consensus against Asad and the actions of the Syrian regime has been "strengthened".
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and other countries, such as Turkey, are taking on an increasingly hard tone" with regard to repression in Syria, says Mark Toner, spokesperson for the State Department.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians have already lost their lives and at least 19 members of the regime forces in the Deraa region in southern Syria, as announced by the Syrian Human Rights Observatory (OSDH).
Two other civilians have died "during bombings and shootings with heavy machine guns in Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, according to that NGO.
During a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Al Mualem considers that the country "goes forward towards the end of the crisis".
In addition, it has reacted strongly to the Arab League's decision to suspend its functions from Damascus, which in its view constitutes a "dangerous step".
Syria "will not flak," he added, ensuring that "the plot against Syria will fail."
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently studying a “civil protection mechanism” and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, military media and observers to the country.
The French Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alain Juppé, has also expressed his support for sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime which, in his view, is enclosed in the "paranoia".
A further extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled to be held in Rabat tomorrow to develop the implementation of the crisis exit plan adopted on 2 November, which includes, in particular, the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities in the hands of opposition and the release of the detained demonstrators.
The Russian Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, judged yesterday the Arab League's decision "uncorrect", while China urged Syria to implement the crisis exit plan, although it did not express its support for the implementation of possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti asks for time to the markets and sacrifices to the Italians
The future head of the Italian Government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for some time to form their team and launch a programme that will include "sacrifices" intended to recover lost credibility during the last months of the Berlusconi Government.
The former European Commissioner discussed yesterday with political parties and today met with trade unions and employers.
It should form a relatively restricted cabinet, composed of technocrats outside Parliament.
"Monti has spoken of a broad programme with many sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many small parliamentary groups who participated in the meetings, having met with the President of the designated Council.
For his part, the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, has said that he hopes that Mario Monti will request a vote of confidence from Parliament by Friday to ensure that the new Government has sufficient support.
The consultations will end with Mr Monti's presentation of a limited list, no doubt of a dozen ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Monti has commented on the nervousness of stock markets and bondors yesterday, asking for time.
In the "democracy, there are precise deadlines" to form a government and prepare its programme, he stressed, adding that it is "sure that the markets will have patience and understand it".
Its designation by the President was initially welcomed by the markets, but then concern was raised, particularly after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The designated Prime Minister should create a team consisting mainly of technocrats, even if he has pointed out that he would like to include "politics".
The new Government will have to operate until 2013, the date of the forthcoming legislation, it considers.
According to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will get the vote of confidence from Parliament by Friday.
Monti has pledged that, when he is in charge, he will work in the light of the urgency and with the aim of Italy "regaining its role" in Europe.
A spokesperson for the European Commissioner Olli Rehn pointed out that "even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy will not vary."
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its objective of achieving a budgetary balance in 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, has called for further rigorous measures.
Italian chief Emma Marcegaglia, who will see her mate, also stressed the need to boost the economy, "since a country that does not grow cannot meet the deficit requirements".
Monti, famous for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "change of time" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism"; the "professor" symbolizes "the challenge of seriousness" and "other Italy", according to editorialists.
The great incognito will be the longevity of your team.
President Napolitano wants to avoid early elections, since Italy has to place some €200 billion in state obligations before April 2012.
A Russian scientist has collaborated with the Iranian nuclear programme
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has collaborated with Iran in the development of a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, said on Monday an American NGO specializing in atomic risk.
For the identification of the researcher, the International Science and Security Institute (ISIS) is based on a recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents issued by that United Nations agency.
The IAEA expressed last week its "grave concern" about a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to ISIS, based extensively on IAEA documents, Danilenko, born in 1934, had worked for three decades since the 1960s at a Soviet military nuclear centre in Cheliabinsk (Ural) and would have participated in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, it would have left the centre to form a company focused on the production of "nanodiamers" in Kiev.
His company's economic problems would have led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Thereafter, it is believed that it cooperated with the Iranian programme between 1996 and 2002 before returning to Russia.
In its last report, the IAEA notes that there are "clear indications that Iran is developing" a nuclear detonation system "with the help of a foreign expert, who was not only familiar with the technique, but also, as one Member State has informed the Agency, worked during most of his career in that technology in the military nuclear programme of his country of origin."
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by about 50 per cent between 2009 and 2010, while in the same period, other types of racial and religious violence have decreased or increased only slightly, according to statistics published by the FBI on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of acts of violence against Muslims has increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. it has increased by 49 per cent, compared with a 13 per cent increase in acts of violence against Catholics, a 4 per cent reduction in crimes against the Jews and an overall 14 per cent increase in the number of crimes and anti-religious crimes.
The total number of “hate crimes” has increased slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% are due to racial differences and 20% to religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is worrying that these crimes and crimes have increased again," the human rights organization Human Rights First said, "the increase in acts of violence against Muslims is especially significant," the organization added in a communiqué.
"Human Rights First has long been pointing out that violence against Muslims, as well as all kinds of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights," added a leader of the organization, Paul Legendre.
"The U.S. Government can and should strive to put an end to such abuses," he said, "as such efforts could include an improvement in police reports on "hate crimes".
The "hate crime" in U.S. Federal Law was inherited from the time of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation was adopted following the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence linked to race, skin color, religion, origin and, now, sexual inclination.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The microblogging Twitter site modified on Monday the presentation of its platform to allow its users, in particular, to observe the activity of the people they follow, which causes their service to look a little more like Facebook.
A new "activity" tab and another so-called "name" tab allow you to follow more legibly and live the activity of other "Twittos", i.e. those netizens whose messages ("tweets") follow on the Internet or who follow you.
This lets you know if you follow up on messages, if you subscribe to new accounts, if you prefer any messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "with a small percentage of users in August" before spreading it to the rest of the network on Monday, according to AFP Twitter spokesperson Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was known for its uninstinctive operation, with slightly esoteric terms (RT to forward another person's message, followfriday to recommend follow another user) making the happiness of the initiatives, thus opening up to a wider audience with a more comparable handling than that of the public networks Facebook and Google+.
On the net, users have debated with different opinions the interest of this innovation.
"It's useless, it's invasive and it looks too much like Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"The Activity function will help me follow some elements of my Twitter stream better," writes @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction of a "golden rule" budget in the Constitution
The Government of the great Social Democratic/Democratic coalition that is in power in Austria has decided on Tuesday to include in the Constitution a "gold rule" budget to reduce the public deficit and thus to avoid possible degradation of Austria's sovereign note by credit rating agencies (triple A).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor, Werner Faymann himself, who announced this decision following a Council of Ministers, when the Austrian public debt reached 74.6%, a figure well above the ceiling of 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency were to be reduced to one level, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay €3 billion more in interest every year," said the Democratic Chancellor of Foreign Affairs, Michael Spindelegger.
Austria thus responded to a request from the Brussels Summit to the euro area member countries of 26 October: in it, the Heads of State and Government called for the inclusion, before the end of 2012, of the reduction of the public deficit and the recovery of the balance of public accounts in the Constitution or in a Law with equivalent value.
The arrangements adopted by the Austrian Government are close to the "German model", as Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the structural government deficit should fall by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year and, starting in 2017, the structural government deficit of the Federal State should not exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while regional States, as well as municipalities, should present balanced budgets.
The objective is to reduce public debt by around 2020/2021 under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty.
A Strong Man
The threat of new intervention by the foreign exchange market
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would again intervene in the marking of change if the yen continued to increase.
"We will intervene, as we did last time, if we find that excessive volatility occurs" in the yen's exchange rate, Noda explained to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose up to levels close to the historic peaks that the Japanese authorities made on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo sold massively yen for dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had just reached a new record since 1945 compared to the US currency.
But the yen has been slowly rebounding ever since, driven by the purchases of investors who consider it a "refuge value" in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar to recommit Tuesday to less than 77 yen and the euro has dropped below the symbolic 105 yen bar, reaching levels close to those that caused the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was about 120 yen and the euro was over 160 yen.
This explosion of the Japanese currency is detrimental to the exports of the archipelago, as it increases the products made in Japan and reduces the value of revenues obtained abroad by Japanese companies when they convert them to the national currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild itself" after the earthquake and tsunami of 11 March, which devastated the Tohoku region (north-east), Noda highlighted, who fears that the root-cut Yen's caressing the weak recovery.
The third world economic power has recovered growth in the third quarter (1.5 per cent in relation to the previous quarter), for the first time in one year, thanks to an increase in exports and consumption of households affected by the catastrophe.
But the Prime Minister considers that the high level of the yen did not reflect the "economic bases of Japan".
The Minister of Finance, Jun Azumi, has asked the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Council on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
However, the Deputy Governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken "the appropriate measures", suggesting that greater monetary flexibility should not be expected on Wednesday.
During its last meeting at the end of October, the issuing institute increased its purchases of Letters of the Treasury by five billion euros (47 billion euros), bringing to 55 billion yen (519 billion euros) the threshold of funds devoted to the acquisition of various financial instruments to flood the liquidity market.
euro area:
the types grow, the bags weaken
The risk of debt crisis contagion continues to harm European indices.
Despite the appointment of new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy, as well as better growth figures in France and Germany, the types of weaker countries continue to increase.
Still concerned about the stability of the euro area, European stock exchanges sink a little further into the negative area on Tuesday, 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., ACC 40 loses 1.4% and stands at 3,064 points.
Dax loses 0.4% in Frankfurt and London 0.1%.
"In view of the new tensions in relation to the yields of loans from the most affected euro area States, stock markets around the world continue to be part of their recent profits."
"The investors, nervous, are perfectly aware of the risk of contagion," explains Terry Pratt, institutional corridor at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange has closed with a fall of 0.7%, renewing the concerns of market participants regarding Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has a fixed eye in Europe and exchanges will continue to take place in a limited margin of variation, so that investors will have no evidence that the situation has stabilized," considers Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
The reappearance of concerns about the future of the euro area affects the single currency, which continues to decline on Tuesday.
The euro remains at its lowest level for a month and a half.
At 10 a.m., the European currency was worth $1,3570, a fall of 0.4%.
According to the runners, it has lost courage after the match of Chancellor Angela Merkel, the CDU, which met on Monday in Congress, adopted a motion which includes, in particular, the option for a country in difficulty to leave the euro area without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish types outperform 6%
The credit types of Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
On Tuesday morning, the performance of the Italian obligations at 10 years was 6.85 per cent, while Spanish titles at the same time offered 6.2 per cent.
These tensions in relation to the interest rates of the countries of the south, although also in France, continue to fuel the fears of the speakers.
The head of the future Italian Government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for time to improve the situation in Italy, which is at risk of suffocating itself with the weight of their debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, for his part, has stated that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October would be his Government's "principal work".
Spain is at the point of view of the markets, while the legislative elections will take place on Sunday.
The difference between 10-year obligations in Germany and Spain has reached a new historic peak.
Waiting for growth figures in the euro area
From a statistical point of view, France has recorded an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, i.e. a figure more favourable than 0.3% expected, driven by domestic consumption.
The Insee, however, has revised the figure of the second quarter downwards, with a decrease of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
In addition, the fourth quarter is the one that really concerns economists.
Germany, for its part, has experienced 0.5 per cent growth over the same period.
The first forecasts are expected for the euro area as a whole at 11 a.m. after the European Commission has warned about the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
facts must be worth more than dogmas
If there is an issue that cannot be addressed taking into account short-term considerations or simply thinking about emotions, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly influence the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is appropriate that an election meeting should be time to reflect on these issues and on the place of nuclear energy.
The debate will only be useful if it examines the economic, social and environmental implications of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, on rational data.
Now that we are 7 billion people on the planet, demographic developments will mean doubling electricity demand by 2050, unless a large part of the world's population is deprived of a vital element.
At the same time, the growing shortage of fossil resources must be alleviated in order to continue to produce electricity continuously, without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate change, an issue that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany remains alone in its decision to give up nuclear energy.
That is not the case either of Belgium, which submits its own to the need to find a source capable of replacing it, or Switzerland, which aims only to build state-of-the-art power plants.
On the other hand, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, for example, continue with determination with their projects.
The United States, for its part, after Fukushima decided to add a unit to its park, returning to the construction of a disrupted power plant following the accident of Three Mile Island.
If the German model, based on renewable energies, is sometimes presented as an example, reality goes against such speech.
The election of Berlin will result in an increase in the price of electricity, an increase in energy dependence due to the increased need for imported gas, in particular from Russia, an increase in CO2 emissions from the construction of gas and coal plants.
Within a few months, the harmful effects will be noted.
Consideration should be given to the case of Denmark.
Europe's champion in the wind sector, of which 30% of its electricity is also one of the major users of coal and gas due to wind intermittent; for this reason, its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the constancy of our energy policy, our neighbours pay an electricity bill of 40% higher than that of French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of maintaining industrial utility in the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For that reason, any significant reduction in nuclear energy would result in a sharp rise in the price of electricity, which would leave realism to the wonderful declarations about the reindustrialization of our country and the defence of our purchasing power.
This is a price which the vast majority of French people refuse to pay and, in fact, do not manifest opposition to that kind of energy by principle, according to surveys.
Let us remember that our country's energy policy has lost building an industrial sector with 125,000 executive jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Extensively export-oriented, it covers a galaxy of SMEs specialized in international markets and which can create non-relocable jobs.
If France decided to abandon nuclear energy, it would entail the sacrifice of much of these SMEs and the loss of EUR 6 billion annually in French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
What electrician would charge an EPR designed to work sixty years, when it is expected to collapse its manufacturer?
In order to solve the equation of nuclear energy, it must be admitted that there is no miraculous source of electricity production, just as there is no devilish source.
The development by Areva of low-carbon and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementary nature of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is essential to maintain the highest level of security.
In France, we have a security authority that exercises strict and transparent control over both existing plants and the construction of Flamenville.
Our teams, of recognized professionalism, are also obsessed with security.
In the middle of the century, the nuclear sector has suffered three serious accidents.
Only one, that of Three Mile Island, occurred under normal operating conditions; it did not cause any consequences for people or the environment.
In Chernobyl, the accident was due to reactor design and unforgivable human failures.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was due to two natural disasters of an unprecedented magnitude, which led to the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear sector will learn from this accident, as it did from the previous two.
Thanks to this progress and cooperation between the security authorities, and the French and German operators and builders, the EPR presents a design capable of resisting such phenomena.
While all the electric actors who want to build a power plant study, the interruption of their construction in Flamenville would be a great gift for the competitors of Areva and EDF, as it would leave them free to take the lead in the inevitable development of the nuclear sector.
It is essential and legitimate to seek the best energy options for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the emotions, dogmas and partisan maneuvers dominate such an important debate for our country's economic, social and financial situation.
Immigration, a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy implemented by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from a number of points of view: the saturation of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the figure policy, the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of "human rights countries" of France.
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students who have jumped the headlines, with the Minister of the Interior (see Libération newspaper of 23 May) proclaiming in the past that France "does not need foreign talents, workers or waiters".
However, it is rarely considered economically.
The question is that, on this issue, there is quite a consensus between the left and the right.
In the case of the right, Jacques Chirac set the orientation stating in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed people should not be a problem for a country with about two million migrant workers", while on the left, the tone was Michel Rocard saying that France "cannot take care of all the misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, both the left and the right shared the fear of the invasion of the national territory by a multitude of Polish plumbers.
On both sides, immigrants are regarded as a burden to the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity with which they act with respect to immigrants.
In his programme, François Hollande limited himself to including trivialities, indicating that the coderroll will solve the "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be profitable electorally, but economically it is very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in a recent work summarizing the latest knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among experts on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
Limitation of immigration weakens growth and harms employment.
Fears related to the impact of immigrants are based on the idea that they can replace national workers, particularly those who are less qualified, by pressing for their wages to be reduced.
But experience shows that immigrants are actually rather complementary than substitutes for national workers and are mainly employed in sectors with a lack of employment.
Unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national and most skilled workers in dynamic sectors where training does not meet the demand for staff.
A positive effect on wages
In the same way that a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country where there was a lack of anesthetists, complementarity between nationals and immigrants led to a positive impact on the wages and employment of nationals.
Taking into account the above, Giovanni Peri calculated that an increase of 1% of migration flows represents an increase in real long-term wages from 0.6 to 0.9%.
And, without taking into account the fact that the diversity that immigrants contribute contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (there are a large proportion of American Nobel prizes naturalized and businesses such as Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Immigrants are also net contributors to social systems, as they contribute an average of 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The International Labour Organization estimates, for example, that in Germany an immigrant who reaches 30 years of age will make a net contribution (less-expenditure income) of EUR 150,000 to average public budgets throughout his life.
At the beginning of his term of office, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to look for the missing growth points "with his teeth".
These teeth, which deterred immigrants, had the exact opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, it just needs to think about a European democracy.
Democracy is a precious but also fragile good.
The European continent should be able to remember this because, although it was invented in Athens more than 2,000 years ago, throughout the 20th century it has suffered the tragedies of the World War, totalitarianisms, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some may have believed that, in order for democracy to permanently triumph over its enemies, it would be sufficient to exercise the vote and as direct as possible.
We know, from Napoleon "the Little One", that it was something thought.
Universal suffrage, although it is a necessary condition for democracy, is not enough on its own and can even become an "instrument of oppression", as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and control of powers, an education, lights, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis we are experiencing in Europe is an economic crisis, but it is about to become a political and democratic crisis.
The palinodia of the true-false Greek referendum had, in this respect, a double revealing effect: it showed the need for a powerful return from the political sphere, but also the worrying feeling of its impossibility, its incongruence.
It must reflect on this ambivalence to overcome it.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic battle have now moved away and that, in many cases, Republican soldiers are no longer moving forward in the right direction.
We will not win if we demand a succession of national referendums organized according to needs and disorderly.
A blank signature to the absolute European monarch or a halt to the vacuum of the nationalist hole: what options for the citizen!
No, we do not want to take effect, but a common exercise, full right, quiet and continuous, of options and democracy, this time at European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (in fact, we would not know where to finish the list), because there is only one crisis, the crisis in Europe.
The whole of Europe is the one that goes hand in hand with the orders of the markets and rating agencies, which suffer from its impotence and lack of solidarity.
It is Europe as a whole that suffers from humiliation in the international sphere.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but it is all of Europe that slowly loses sovereignty and, with it, each of its nations.
The most urgent thing is that popular sovereignty recovers the helm of the European project.
Because only together can Europeans reduce the burden of their debts, free themselves from markets and prepare their future through investments.
The outcome of the crisis will require decisions at European level that cannot be taken without complete democratic legitimacy, unless it is to lead us to disaster.
Having fought for a long time against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone is currently calling for European economic governance.
So be it.
But thinking about it without greater political and democratic integration, and without being lived as such by the citizens, would be a new madness and would lead us to a new dead end.
We must take on a new stage of European construction.
To build the Republic in France, it was necessary to "make" Republicans.
The interest-driven revolution would not be enough.
This lesson continues to apply.
We must build a more integrated Europe from an economic point of view.
Only by building a more democratic Europe at the political level can we achieve true European people's sovereignty.
To build Europe, let's make Europeans.
Cards with "non-contact" chip are generalized
The world fair of chip cards starts on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, with an optimistic atmosphere.
In fact, 2011 should end with an 11% increase in global sales of cards with microprocessors (bank cards, SIM cards, etc.), with a total of 6,000 million units, according to Eurosmart cabinet calculations.
The most powerful segment is that of contactless technology, which allows you to pay for common transport or purchases simply by approaching a card to a reader.
This year will be sold worldwide 460 million cards with no contact chip, 320 million more than the previous year!
Its share should continue to increase in 2012 (expected 580 million units) and represent about 10% of the global chip card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe, which has been retarded for a long time in relation to the Asia-Pacific region, is gaining ground in the non-contact payment sector.
About 26 million Visa bank cards already have this function, which is accepted at 75,000 payment terminals.
In France, its beginnings are more modest: 400,000 Visa cards are being used without contact.
But the big surfaces work for four.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million Pass MasterCard cards this year without contact.
In order to make the upper course, however, banks need to make them available to their customers.
"There are two large French establishments that have committed themselves to spread systematically in the future, among their customers, bank cards equipped with the uncontacted system," says Gérard Nebouy, director general of Visa Europe France.
Banks prove payment by mobile phone
But it is only a first step towards the means of payment of the future: mobile phone.
Currently, there are few devices equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology, which is essential for carrying out the transactions.
"If they're backing back."
"But I should finally experience a real boom next year."
"We plan to sell between 80 and 120 million units worldwide in 2012," explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But banks take the lead.
The Crédit agricultura bank announced yesterday the launch of a test between December and next June in Caen.
The iPhones of about 200 customers and collaborators will be equipped with a case case that allows the payment without contact.
The CPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the General Corporation has also stated yesterday that it is preparing for the marketing of an offer that allows its customers to pay without contact through their mobile.
From Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is increasing
Paris is concerned about the links between Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The links between Al Qaeda terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect of Boko Haram, which had long been suspected, have been confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs Abdelkader Messahel even stated that Algiers already "has certainty".
"The way both organizations operate and intelligence service reports demonstrate that they are cooperating," he explained, without providing more details.
Paris seems to come to a similar conclusion.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger last January would have resumed the gateways.
Kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by persons related to Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory died the next day along with several of his kidnappers during an operation launched by the French special forces.
In the rubble of the intervention, French and Nigerian researchers discovered several telephone chips belonging to terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The study of the calls made indicates to several interlocutors based on Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers particularly captured the interest of researchers: one leads to a Nigerian who stayed for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, Boko Haram's sister-in-law, and the other to a man who is supposedly close to Aqmi and the sect.
"It is progress, but we must certainly expect to have more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"We have known for years that the sect enjoys financial and intellectual support outside and that it is increasingly active," says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, these "supports" had become increasingly evident in the evolution and discourses of Boko Haram or its operational modes, which now involve the use of increasingly complex kamikazes or explosive devices and in the same style as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has since been pressing Abuya to take into account the problems generated by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities, in fact, take time to consider the group as a community of illuminators unworthy of interest.
A quick hit
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram (meaning, in hausa, "Western education is a sin"), encourages the establishment of an Islamic mirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is living a quick success.
It is politicized and demands strict respect for the sharia, while its militants engage in the fight against the wicked central government.
The latter are primarily aimed at churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram's militants were particularly active and the attacks on the police stations multiplied.
Abuya's reaction was, as it usually happens, generalized.
The army attacked the city and 800 dead were registered.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested in life, receives death in prison.
Since then, the sect has been radicalized and abandoned its northern feudalisms.
After Christmas, he claims an attack that causes 80 deaths in Jos and then another one in Abuya.
In June, Boko Haram once again attacked Abuya, in particular the police headquarters, with a suicide attack, the first of these.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations became its first international objective.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which would cover from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria, worries all security specialists.
While Aqmi has attacked Mali and Niger and that the Somalis of Al-Chebab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram emerges as a new threat in the centre of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned him against Boko Haram and said he was willing to share all the information.
The world according to Republican candidates to the Presidency
In relation to China, Iran and Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete in simplicity and lack of knowledge.
A crisis-deprived America, can you manage a complex world with simple ideas or even simplistic ideas?
Listening to Republican candidates for presidents, voters might think so.
For a few days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other candidates have been making more and more squeezing and cutting statements on foreign policy, traditionally a strong point for Republicans.
The often unfounded slogans on China, Iran, help Israel are extended.
Mitt Romney, the best candidate in the race for the designation of the "Great Old Party", has threatened to bring the Chinese to the WTO and denounce them "for handling their currency", a key issue in an America exasperated by the migration of entire fragments from their sector to Asia.
It doesn't matter if that involves the explosion of a commercial war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Obama Ambassador to China and the only candidate who has a sophisticated vision of foreign policy, is nearly drowned by an attitude that "puzzles" emotions.
He has called for a firm but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman, who remains stagnant in the depths of the probes, remains inaudible.
In the style of Reagan
Romney has also promised military intervention in Iran if sanctions fail to disrupt its nuclear programme.
"If I'm elected, I'll stop Iran," he bragged.
"If Obama gets re-elected, they'll have the bomb."
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to meet his obligations to that partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best-classified candidate, shows a shameful ignorance of such topics.
Recently, he urged to counter the Chinese military threat because Beijing "is trying to develop nuclear capacity", apparently ignoring the fact that China has already had the military atom since 1964.
Texan Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to intervene in Iran, says that he is willing to deploy the US army in Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, prohibited by Obama in 2009, is also recommended by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
The differences are considerable with the Republican candidate of 2008, John McCain, a heavy weight in foreign policy.
The opponents of the current President answer that Reagan also had simple ideas and won the Cold War.
Remember that Obama himself was an amateur and had to loosen the piston in the fight against terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of their naive dialogue with Iran, on the hasty departure of Iraq's "boys" and their distortions in Libya, and label it as weak.
But the attacks are not easy for them.
The population is judging more positively Obama's national security balance, which ended with Bin Laden.
From Iraq, he was suspicious of military intervention that generated a sinking.
And, arguing that America needs to be reconstructed economically to resurrect its leadership, Obama gives the impression of being more just.
The North Stream, the new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream pipeline, which communicates directly with Western Europe with Russia through the Baltic Sea bottom, has already been put into service.
It must supply gas to meet the needs of thirty million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with a big pump.
Last Tuesday, more than 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government, participated on the Baltic shores, between orchestra music and a delicate buffet, at the inauguration of the North Stream, the new pipeline that communicates directly, under the sea, Russia with Germany.
Symbolically, the German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart, Mark Rutte, have turned together the steering wheel of the valve controlling the entry of Russian gas into the Western European network.
With this new pipeline, 27.5 million cubic metres of extra Russian gas will arrive every year to Western Europe through a first had 1,224 km communicating the St. Petersburg region with the Land of Mecklemburg-Pomerania.
A second tube should be completed at the end of 2012 which will provide a total of 55,000 million cubic metres of gas, that is enough to cover all French consumption.
In addition, it is already discussed the possibility of building a third tube through the same route.
For Gazprom, the completion in time of this huge work presents airs of victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries had firmly opposed the project.
In fact, the North Stream will allow gas to be supplied directly to Germany, avoiding land use by third countries (Poland and Ukraine).
All of a sudden, these two countries lose some of their power: for them, it will be harder to influence Russia by threatening it to close its access to Western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the North Stream as a "new German-Soviet pact", in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is, if the issue is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, supporting the Russian project, has gained greater security of supply.
But price is a weakening of the Europe of energy, as the project has created a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
Russia has known, in just five years, to succeed in its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and wealthy Western countries, large gas consumers and increasingly limited reserves.
"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that joins us organically," said François Fillon during the opening of the pipeline, demonstrating to what extent the great contracts in the gas sector are both political and economic.
All this explains the broad smiles on the faces of the managers of Gazprom, numerous in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical achievement.
The submarine tube is made of cement-coated steel to protect it from the anchorages of ships.
It is supported at the bottom of the sea, at an average depth of 200 m.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating back to World War II.
"It was necessary to remove or destroy a hundred of them, by precaution," says Jens Müller, spokesperson for North Stream society.
It was also necessary to extort measures for the protection of fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake that weighs like 242 Eiffel towers and is not interrupted throughout its length: neither by valves nor by maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned in the waters of Sweden, but the project managers gave up on it, seeing that the Swedes were not very willing to allow a Russian state company to establish itself permanently on the sea opposite their shores.
"In case of damage, we will interrupt the gas passage in less than a minute," says Jens Müller.
In case of leak, the gas from the pipeline will therefore be released into the atmosphere.
However, the manufacturers consider an escape unlikely, since they have planned joints that they will have a flight every 100,000 years, according to the forecasts.
Control of the state of the pipeline is ensured by a submarine robot, dragged by a ship, which conducts external inspections, as well as by a device circulating inside the pipeline.
With the form of a pure, it is inserted inside the tube, which has a diameter of one meter, and moves with the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full journey days at a speed of three meters per second, it provides accurate data on possible metal deformations.
The pipeline has been designed to operate for fifty years without the need for any kind of repair.
Gas circulation is guaranteed simply by pressure.
At first it is 200 bars and, at the exit of 100 bars.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leading company is Gazprom, which owns 51% of the stakes.
It was joined by the Germans E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French GDF Suez group (9% each).
These five companies have created a joint venture called Nord Stream, which is responsible for building and exploiting the pipeline.
It has its headquarters in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is especially favourable.
After that, Gazprom rented the company, for a period of 25 years renewable, the entire gas transport capacity.
"Gazprom will pay you for total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas that is actually being transported," says Jens Müller.
The financing of the construction of the pipeline has been brought to an end by 30 per cent with the contribution of the shareholders and by 70 per cent through bank loans.
The total cost of the work should reach EUR 7.400 million for both tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, investment has reached 240 million.
But minority shareholders are confident that they will not exceed their investment, as Gazprom assumes the risk of expenditure alone.
The gas pipeline emerges from the Baltic in Lubmin, on a sandy coast planted with pines.
Some valves, with 4.5 meters high, form the exit door of the gas.
There are sensors that measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas on arrival, before it is transferred to the German pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives one million cubic metres of Russian gas every hour.
At full capacity, it will be three million per hour and in 2012, six million.
Moleskine, a brand book.
Created half a century ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to return people the taste for writing.
It has an air of adventure, of hours of writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognized, with its rectangular black pastes, its rubber, its broken white leaves, as aged by time.
However, the Moleskine notebooks with the present appearance were born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at that time to launch a book of design notes, but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, then consultant of the company, took care of the launch of the new product.
The notebook is inspired by an ancient production technique, the soft skin skin, which refers to a varnished cotton used, among other things, to cover the banquets.
This type of notebook was highly valued by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has adapted to the present taste an old and forgotten object, an icon of the avant-garde artists until the 20th century," says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become responsible for the brand in Mode Mode Mode.
And he achieved success.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26 per cent, up to a volume of 12.7 million units sold.
The confidential production of the first few years has been far away, in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine goes beyond the Italian borders and exports its products to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to determine the buyer's profile, as the notebook attracts businessmen as well as students and professionals alike.
Like Moleskine, its users are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cult.
The small Italian company, which had twelve workers at its beginning, now owns about 100 and, since 2008, has two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
He distributes his notebooks in bookstores, from the Fnac to small shops in downtown cities, and has been able to impose his identity.
"We have adapted to the times and the need to write, despite the rise in emails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature goes hand in hand with Moleskine's development: recently, the brand has launched the exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists exhibit their own notebook.
In August, he also launched a notebook with leopard caps, at the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: bags, agendas, pens, computer wallpapers... The brand covers a wide range of supports.
A success that causes envy: in the fall of 2006, Mode Mode was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, currently Syntegra Capital, thus writing a new page in Moleskine's history.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers still so high?
About 19 per cent of disabled people are looking for a job.
The 15th Week for the Employment of the Disabled begins today.
Despite a determined public policy, implemented since 2005, the unemployment rate among disabled people doubles the average rate: 19 per cent, compared to 9 per cent for the whole population.
Disheartening?
"No," says Éric Blanchet, Director General of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of the disabled.
"The progress achieved for 15 years is considerable.
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice but three times higher than the average.
"However, there's still a lot to be done."
It should be mentioned that disabled persons continue to face many obstacles to access to employment.
They tend to be older: 37% are over 50 (an average 17%).
They have a low level of qualification: 80 per cent have not completed the bachelor's degree and of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread among them: 53 per cent for the disabled, compared to 38 per cent on average.
In other words, there are many issues that make it especially difficult to return to the world of work and that "constitute the main problem," says Christian Grapin, general director of Tremtlin, an association created in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
Those are the objective obstacles.
Moreover, there are those who are not mentioned; people's mentality advances, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Entrepreneur Association for the Cité noted that the directors surveyed have "a level of knowledge on low disabilities", with an "excessive representation of persons in wheelchairs, physical or intellectual disabilities".
The result: private companies with more than 20 workers are far away from the goal of hiring 6% of disabled workers, which was set in a law of... 1987.
According to the latest available figures, which date back to 2008, they reach a ratio of 2.6 per cent.
"We now reach around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Ageffiph, the agency responsible for collecting the contributions of companies that do not respect this law.
The test: the number of establishment "submitted to this contribution", as well as the amounts disbursed, has decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 million to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law that increased contributions has generated great pressure for businesses," explains Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also reflects a genuine awareness, particularly among large groups."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59 per cent of companies with between 20 and 49 employees have disabled employees in their workforce, compared with 82 per cent of companies with between 100 and 199 workers.
Hazard: "A joy"
About to face the Blues on Tuesday night (20h45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens do not hide the pleasure that this friendly party generates.
We will not dare to say that there was connivance between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting next to each other, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard really made peace on the stage of the stadium of France.
Five months after the gesture of resentment of his front against Turkey, the Belgian electorate has no more than praise for him.
"I was very happy for Eden, for its progress and for its Belgian."
"I want to move forward," Lille's front answered.
As for the contrast between their presentations on their team and in the selection, "it is a set", it has been justified.
"In Lille, I am all year round, which does not apply to Belgium.
"I have to get settled."
Called to play against Romania on Friday night, taking into account this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "bright".
Don't forget the pleasure.
He has been encouraging the Blues since he was seven years old, as well as during the winning campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been his fan," he says.
This will undoubtedly reinforce the particular character of the meeting.
Especially because he will face "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)", he recalls.
"We have just faced each other recently.
"To play against them is always a joy."
Leekens has simply referred to pride.
"Pride" for contesting "a gala game."
"Pride" also to check, as "neighbor", that France "becomes a very high-level team", about a year after Knysna's trauma.
"Laurent Blanc has done a great job," he said enthusiastically.
While Belgium will not attend the next European competition, the technician would be delighted to be able to share the plane with the Blues towards... Brazil, in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are growing up," he said.
"We are building something; players are ambitious, they are hungry.
"You can see it in the next matches." Including the match against France.
Portugal shows a lot of confidence
The Portugal of Paulo Bento faces a great optimism about the party back against Bosnia (22h00), which will be held on Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the party of departure, they lacked realism on both teams.
"When these 90 minutes pass, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
There is no doubt about it; the Selection, which has been leading since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 Euro Cup.
Indeed, only 90 minutes separate Portugal from happiness.
But there is a game to play and a rival, Bosnia, to defeat.
Taking into account the game of going (0-0), on Friday in Zenica's hell, it seems obvious that the thing is not decided.
Portugal dominated the party for more than an hour, yes, but could not mark the valuable goal that would have given him peace.
"It's a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, since we haven't marked out of the house."
But at home, at the bright Lisbon Light Stadium, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, in front of an audience that should be equally enthusiastic, even if it is evident that the party "is very equal", said an optimistic but lucid Benedict.
"We hope the party is very equal, but we are fully convinced that we can take the lead," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We continue to have a 50% chance to participate in the Eurocopa 2012", however, has relativized Carlos Queiroz's successor.
The tie on Friday in Bosnia obliges the Portuguese to mark and win.
The Bosnians could get a tie, although they also need to score.
"It's a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, since we haven't scored out of the house," Bento lamented.
"We're going to play against a team that has great technical quality and has players with great individual quality," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will intend to exert, from the beginning, a maximum pressure on the Bosnians to "don't leave them time to think".
A good idea, provided, this time, it's realistic.
