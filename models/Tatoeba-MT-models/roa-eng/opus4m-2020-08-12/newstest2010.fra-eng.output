Barack Obama will be the fourth American president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
American President Barack Obama will fly to Oslo in Norway to spend 26 hours there and be the fourth American president of history to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
The $1.4 million diploma, medal and cheque will be awarded to him, among other things, for his exceptional efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and collaboration among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will land in the morning in the Norwegian metropolis and will have a busy program.
He will first go to the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time the five members of the Committee who chose him in October among 172 people and 33 organizations.
The presidential couple's planning then includes an interview with the King of Norway Harald V and Queen Sonja.
The visit will meet its summit in the afternoon at a solemn ceremony where Obama will receive the prestigious reward.
He will be the fourth President of the United States to receive it, but only the third will be awarded the prize in the Committee's own court.
The White House informed in advance that Obama would talk about the war in Afghanistan during the award.
The President does not want to avoid this issue because he is aware that he receives this prize by being a president who is currently leading a war in two countries.
He reinforced the war effort a few days ago by sending additional units to Afghanistan, which none of his critics would forget to stress.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a check of ten million Swedish crowns (about 1.1 million Euros).
It intends to donate to charitable works, but it has not yet specifically decided which ones.
Her programme will then take her and her wife to a banquet including, in addition to the king and queen of Norway, the head of government and 250 other guests.
Obama was rather reluctant at first.
For example, he mentioned having the feeling that he did not deserve it fully.
He also repeated several times that it is not a price for himself, but for all those who defend the same values as him.
As soon as the announcement was announced, he stated that it would be an "invitation to act" for him.
A defender of nature accused of blackmail
Litoměřice police charged the president of the Litoměřice Nature Protectors Society with blackmail.
On several occasions last year he appealed for several construction site procedures and demanded money from investors for his personal profit in exchange for his withdrawal of his appeal, said Alena Romová, spokesperson for the Litoměřice police.
The president of the Litoměřice Nature Protector Society is Lubomír Studnička.
He is currently in detention and is at risk of up to three years in prison.
Waste sorting bins are not perfumed in Brno
In Prague everyone can choose their drinks packagings, while in the villages of South Moravie you fall on tribes at each corner of the street.
What about Brno?
There, you should take several minutes before finding the right bins.
I don't mean we wouldn't sort the waste at all in Brno.
But I feel that the city councillors, the second largest city in the country, are not interested enough in this problem.
Brno is at the stone age of waste sorting not only because citizens can still choose only paper, glass and PVC, but especially given the number of benes dedicated to these wastes.
Have you ever tried throwing a plastic bottle into the city center?
It's a whole science, which mainly requires time and nerves of steel.
The only place I've found for the moment is the Moravie square in front of Potrefena Husa.
That Mr. Onderka and his colleagues don't want me, but it seems to me to be so little.
Not to mention the fact that in other neighborhoods of the city it's not a sinecure either.
So finally, many of my friends don't sort their waste.
By paress.
It makes them a trot to get to the binnes.
I'm not surprised.
After a party myself, I proposed to throw away some bottles of glass and PVC.
Except I didn't notice any colour bins on Kounicova Street.
Fortunately I found the right place by going to take the tram.
That said, the wastes were overflowing.
It is after all the center of Brno, who is supposed to represent the city best, isn't it?!
It is likely that ecology and a so-called aestheticism are not of great interest to Brno's socialists.
They prefer to buy in the city a place in the first league of hockey that disgraces the city throughout the country, instead of buying some extra bens and offering the sorting of more raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I'm glad I was able to comfort my impression with official statistics after having dragged a moment on the internet.
According to data from the company EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the entire South Moravia region.
Paroubek's budget has taken out of silvery pensions and sick leave
After the left has increased, despite the Government's opinion, farmers or civil servants may lack money for pensions, sick leave or housing savings.
But also for the interests of the State's debt or international judicial procedures.
This will increase the problems of those who will rule in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When social democrats and communists imposed the increase for certain classes, they were based on the fact that the government will borrow for sensitive expenses, pensions or sick leave. "It's just putting back the problems later, mine the land," Janota said.
It should be noted that the interest to be paid on borrowed money is increasing and that it will have to be returned sooner or later.
The state does not really have the choice to know where to draw money.
If it does not reduce social aid or its expenditure, it will have to increase taxes.
To all those that the left has now increased: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And then their children.
People will touch them and must not fear for their pensions or health insurance, of which 1.8 billion have disappeared.
But at the expense of greater indebtedness of the state - next year there will not be a shortage of 163 billion in cash, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, debt will grow more rapidly and with it, interest-related spending.
The state will need money to repair it and it will no longer be sufficient to increase VAT slightly or reduce maternity leave as the government has done in its anti-deficit package.
There will also be five billion to complete the construction of roads and railways due to the transfer of money to a few elector groups.
These are mainly already decided and initiated sections which cannot be modified to reduce costs.
At most keep them, which is not free either.
This means delaying or stopping thirty major construction sites, and the collection of European funds is also in danger, according to the caution of Karel Hanzelka, spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The ČSSD has proposed to solve the financial deficit very rightly - it will grow in the dividends of ČEZ (provider and distributor of electricity), which the State largely owns and will feed the transport fund.
The concern is that the amount of dividends is never certain and that it is not in any case a bottomless well.
Last year, 18 billion were sailed from ČEZ to budget.
Each year, dividends are used to pay for the removal of ecological damage, to complete retirement accounts or to serve as a reserve for the retirement reform that is being prepared.
Moreover, this trick increases the real budget deficit by 5.7 percent of GNP according to EU rules.
And it's far from being the end of the carnival of transfers.
The budget for various damages to victims of communism and crimes, even housing savings, has declined by almost three billion.
It is not certain that the State can act without this money.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international procedure, we will have to pay it anyway, says Janota.
The Minister will then have to save on the department's side or, in the worst case, touch on the government's budget reserve.
There is also a shortage of 100 million to the two-billion draft State Fund, which must monitor the expenditure of each administration online.
The first step will start in January.
If the Minister of Finance did not find any money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and sanctions would take place, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will master two operating systems
In the future, Americans consider a mobile phone that will allow the user to switch from one operating system to another by pressing a single button.
Projects that have been revealed appear promising.
Just one button and you move from Windows Mobile to Android in a few seconds.
It is precisely this possibility that is the goal of the US company VMware, which mainly deals with the development of virtualization software for computers.
We will allow you to manage two user profiles at the same time on your mobile phone.
You can switch between them, you can differentiate them into staff and professional
Both will work at the same time, said Srinivas Krishnamurti of the VMware company in an interview for the Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and a first demonstration was made a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization on smartphones does not take place in fiction.
VMware has already successfully presented a test version to journalists, with a smartphone equipped with two operating systems.
It is a Nokia N800 modified with a 128 MB RAM memory, which simultaneously ran the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems.
The development of new technologies for mobile phones is growing.
VMware is now working with European and American operators to test virtualization on smartphones, and customers are expected to have access to current devices 2012.
The mountain snow shortage worries hoteliers
Desert tracks are only a problem for lift-up operators.
Lack of snow deters people from booking their ski stays in hotels and pensions.
As a result, it is always possible to identify free rooms for all dates in winter, including Christmas and New Year.
We have a lot of visits to our website.
Netizens go through the offers, ask for prices but do not dare to make a reservation for the moment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask if there will be snow or mud at Christmas," said Martin Jandura, operator of Spindl.Info.
If you want to spend the New Year's Dreams at Špindler eh Mlýn, you better not hesitate to book.
If the economy is given priority and the quality of the accommodation comes only afterwards, then one can try to wait a few more days.
Špindler hoteliers are currently only offering one-week stays for the New Year.
I think they'll try another time to place them, but they'll also give in and accept shorter periods.
And then the number of free rooms will quickly decrease," Jandura said.
The Tourist Agency Ingtours du Vrchlabí also offers free beds for all winter periods.
We are most interested in Christmas week at the moment, it is not completely sold.
We're still free, let's say, half the rooms in our offer.
That's why we've already prepared some less expensive last minute Christmas stays," said Ingtours Petr Schiefert's director.
The Vrchlabí Tourist Agency can also offer the New Year in Krkonoše, but there are fewer free places.
The fourteen first days of February are just as well, the remaining winter stays are sold on average.
This year, interest in winter stays has been negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow in Krkonoše.
People are waiting for her to fall.
Nobody wants to spend the winter on the mountain without snow.
If the tracks recover during the week, Christmas will also be complete," says Schiefert.
Conversely, the occupation of the Horizon Hotel in Pec pod Sněžkou is slightly higher than last year.
We have an improvement of about five percent.
We have a few last places for New Year as well as for Christmas.
There is great interest during the holidays of January of the Polish and February sell well too," reports Karel Rada, director of the best hotel in Pec.
The hotel Omnia near the central parking lot of Jánské Lázně is also complete at eighty percent during the New Year period.
On the contrary, half of the beds remain empty at Christmas in the most recent hotel in Jánské Lázně.
This year, we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we have already had sixty percent of the current occupation.
February is a little weaker for the moment but as soon as the snow falls, the interest for stays in the Krkonoše will certainly grow still indicated the director of the hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
However, the hoteliers of the Krkonoše must not expect more snow.
Thursday it will be cooler and if there are precipitation, they should be snowing in the mountains.
But later on, time should warm up, inform Jiří Jakubský of the Hradec station of the Czech hydrometeorological institute.
United States: Repetition is Mother of Wisdom
It becomes even comical, the assiduous effort with which Barack Obama, president of the wise reputation, reproduces his predecessor's strategy on the Afghan question, which he himself considered simple.
When he ended up letting his doctrine sweat so badly expected, it turned out he had copied it to carbon paper since the Iraqi scenario in Bush three years ago.
Not happy to use in the text itself several times the expression "as in Iraq", he did not hesitate, which is more, to use the title of the discourse of Bush of January 2007 as the title of his own speech: "A new road forward"
At the same time, he personally criticized Bush's idea of sending new reinforcements into an Iraq consumed by civil war as being "irresponsible and catastrophic in its consequences."
However, the following months showed that Bush's strategy, which emanates from the recommendations of campaign commanders, was the only possible and likely to be successful to such an extent that the newspapers currently do not speak of Iraq at all.
This has not improved Bush's reputation, which says, objectively speaking, he left his successor a far more favourable final situation than could be expected.
Barack Obama hopes that in Afghanistan the miracle will happen again
It was again the campaign commanders who requested an increase in the military contingent, including the commander of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who even severely criticized the reluctance of the White House despite the habits of subordination.
He asked 40,000 men to make the situation more favourable.
The president hesitated for three months but without a better option, he at least cheated the general of 10,000 soldiers.
He has succeeded in removing the promise of an additional 5,000 from Europe, even if it was originally 10,000.
What brings the most problems throughout Obama's strategy seems to be his intention to withdraw Afghanistan's armies within 18 months and to complete this whole process within three years. All of Obama's doctrine brings more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt that an increase of half will bring the same fruit as the progress in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized and its leaders honour agreements.
The Afghan situation stands out by the exact opposite - no one can rely on and no treaty is respected.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, accustomed to changing leadership day by day according to what arranges them.
Political institutions, although officially founded, will only remain powder in the eyes behind which patriarchal ethnic relations will proliferate.
It is particularly complex to balance the interests of the various ethnic groups in view of the lack of clarity about the reports, which are still complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a "ready state to act", which is the basic purpose of the operation, does not seem to be very real.
The temporal horizon of Obama's strategy makes his volunteerism perplexed.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and is currently on the brink of chaos.
Only a purely romantic heart and out of reality can be convinced that the small soldiers sent into the tumult of war for their "fast return home" will bring there a real miracle.
From a political point of view, defining a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible, since the Taliban will regard it as the indirect asset of the American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the Europeans' willingness to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is oriented towards the negative.
European policies do not know or want to explain to their voters how security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the mountains of Hindu Kush.
Another factor that can radically alter the situation is the evolution of events related to Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and strengthened sanctions have no effect on Iranians, the Americans will face the very difficult issue of solving the problem through the use of military force.
For example, it will be necessary to answer when, according to Obama, America will come to the victorious withdrawal of Afghanistan's troops.
However, each such solution will result in a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
The only roust for Obama is that it remains three years until the presidential elections and therefore there is still enough time for him to plan on a new strategy, in case it would prove to be a total fiasco.
Goldman Sachs bank leaders will no longer receive cash premiums
High-ranking employees of the U.S. bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive cash premiums this year.
The company has announced it to respond to strong criticism of its wage practices.
The group of 30 senior leaders will receive shares instead of money, which they will not be able to resell within five years.
Actions may be withdrawn from leaders if they take too much risk.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is thus at the forefront of the effort to link salaries with long-term performances on Wall Street.
I assume Wall Street is well aware of the overall sense to take, said the former Investment Banker Douglas Elliott of JPMorgan
The concern is in the details, did he add.
Goldman Sachs has become the target of criticism after putting aside nearly $17 billion for premiums in the first three quarters of this year.
For the current year, the total amount of premiums will likely exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today, according to Reuters Agency.
With the arrival of the financial crisis, the high premiums in the banking sector have become a sensitive political issue in many countries.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it intended to allocate a single tax of fifty percent of bankers' bonuses exceeding 25,000 pounds.
France is preparing similar measures.
This year women have won Nobel prizes in all fields except physics
These are five women, a record number, who received today in Stockholm from the hands of the King of Sweden Charles XVI Gustave the Nobel prizes in the technical and literature disciplines.
In addition to the four scientists there was also the German writer of Romanian origin Herta Müller.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, along with their compatriot Jack Szostak, received the Nobel Prize for Medicine for their research in the field of chromosomes.
The chemistry award was awarded to Israeli Ada Jonath with the American Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for clarifying the structure and function of ribosomes
The last winner received the Nobel Prize in Economics, American Elinor Ostrom with his compatriot Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of economic governance.
The only technical discipline that did not have a winner this year was physics.
This award was given today to scientists Charles Kao for his research in the field of fiber optics and George Smith with Willard Boyle for their invention of CCD chips, which are currently at the base of all digital cameras, faxes or astronomical glasses.
Each winner received the diploma, the Nobel medal and the certificate of acquisition of the monetary reward.
It reaches 10 million Swedish krona in each category. (approximately EUR 1.1 million)
If one of them has several winners, they will share the reward with each other.
The long-awaited Nobel Peace Prize was already awarded this afternoon in Oslo, Norway to U.S. President Barack Obama.
In his speech, he recognized the controversial nature of his reward, since it was only at the beginning of his journey and that he was also at the head of a country engaged in two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
At the discharge of his policy he added that in some situations war is essential for achieving peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota plans to resign. Klaus invited him to the Château
President Václav Klaus will receive Friday morning the Minister of Finance Eduard Janota, who will place his stay in government due to his disagreement with the government's budget for next year as voted by the Chamber of Deputies
It is estimated that the budget and perhaps Janota's position at the cabinet will be on the agenda of their Friday appointment.
Klaus also criticizes the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too big, which further exacerbates the public finances crisis.
Presidential spokesman Radim Ochvat informed the meeting.
Janota then wants to discuss his position Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to budget legislation that will be subject to Klaus' signature, it is a deficit of 163 billion crowns that the Czech Republic should manage.
However, the Chamber of Deputies validated the left-wing proposals on money transfers on Wednesday and increased the salaries of civil servants, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government opposed the proposals of the Social Democrats that they would indirectly increase the budget deficit.
For this reason, a violent disagreement arose between the left, the government, Klaus and the right, on the other hand, which questioned the future of Fischer's cabinet, which had been formed by agreement between the ODS, ČSSD and the Greens Party.
Critics claim that the budget, as voted by Members, removes the package of savings measures passed by the Fischer government and that it must pay off the state debt.
Klaus, who can ratify the State Budget Act but is not required to do so, declared today at a breakfast of discussions with entrepreneurs that policies have long neglected the "serious problem" of the "irreprehensible deficiency" of public finances.
Now there is no favourable solution.
Only a strong government could improve, if it could build on a consensus of wider political parties, according to the President.
The president of the ODS Mirek Topolánek indicated that the budget is boring and that the government should challenge its subsequent existence.
The vice-president of the ODS Petr Nečas told the ČTK that the idea of an administrative firm supported by ČSSD, the ODS and the Greens obviously no longer works.
In his reaction, Prime Minister Fischer described such words as "drastic verdicts".
The head of the ČSSD Jiří Paroubek reacted to Topolánek, saying that the budget deficit prepared for this year by the former Topolánek government is staggering and will exceed 200 billion crowns.
On Wednesday, ČSSD has been successful in ratifying the State budget for the next year.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman will play Mandela in Clint Eastwood's new movie
Despite criticism that the main roles are played by American actors, South Africans claim that the new Hollywood Invictus film - Invaincu will expose a lot of things to the world about the country, its fights and its victories.
History speaks of sport, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
Morgan Freeman, an American actor awarded to the Oscars, embodys Nelson Mandela's life film, a tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and the first black president.
Freeman said it was a 90-year-old Mandela who asked him to incarnate him in the film.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I said, "If I have to incarnate you, I should be able to see you personally.
The seventy-twelve-year-old actor who was rewarded with a prize for his role in the Million Dollar Baby drama in Clint Eastwood's middle of the box, for example, embodied the leader of a movement against slavery, a fictitious US president, even God in the movie Evan All-Power, but never someone still alive and as important for so many people as Mandela is.
The former South African Stateman was imprisoned 27 years for his hard work in favour of the end of apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word meaning invincuous and is the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film tells the true story of Nelson Mandela's joint efforts and the captain of the South African rugby team François to unify the country. President Mandela recently elected knows that his country remains and is still racially and economically divided after apartheid.
He is convinced that he can unite his people through sport and decides to unite rugby players who are among outsiders at the world level.
The South African team will eventually make progress in the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked a few years to bring Mandela's story to the big screen.
I had no other purpose but to play this role so as to bring it closer to reality," said Freeman.
The biggest challenge for me was of course to talk like him.
The actor stated that if he and the international political man were in the same region, he would have tried to meet Mandela, to have dinner with him, to be behind him before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake his hand.
I realized that when I held your hand, I recovered from your energy, it passed on and I felt like I knew how you felt, he said.
It's important for me to try to become someone else.
Matt Damon plays in the film François Pienaar, the captain of a national rugby team in which there is a majority of white players.
The actor stated that he had six months to prepare for a role in the harsh middle of rugby.
For him, his first meeting with Pienaar at his home was a great surprise.
I remember when I knocked at the door of the house, he opened me and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar was, 'I look much bigger in the movie.'
Despite the differences between the actors and the real models, Invictus under the wing of the director Eastwood received positive opinions and even talks about ambitions for the Oscars.
The film critic Todd McCarthy of the Daily Variety newspaper summarized his appreciation in these words: "It's a very good story, a very good film."
In film evaluations on rottentomates.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive reviews.
The mystery of aura in Norway is resolved: Russians tested a rocket
A strange light phenomenon of unknown origin was observed above Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defence recognized only yesterday that it had tested an intercontinental ballistic rocket not far from the Norwegian borders.
However, the launch was still a failure and the "Bulava" type missile which originally had to be the pride of the Russian army gradually became the nightmare of the Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Its repeated presence in rocket tests did not have the expected effect on the success of test flights.
Most of the time, either Bulava didn't fly, or she damaged herself in the middle of the flight.
Russian newspapers speak of "Bulava" as "missile that doesn't fly"
A missile that doesn't fly but shines
This 13th test was carried out at the beginning normally.
It's only at the end of the flight that there was again damage to the equipment.
It was clearly the engine on the third floor of the rocket that exploded.
This time, "Bulava" flew over the nuclear submarine Dmitrij Donskij, which was sailing under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can be precisely fired from a moving and immersed vessel
That is why the mysterious light above Norway caused by an unidentified flying object has probably been by a defective "Bulava".
Besides, the Norwegians did not doubt for a moment that this was a Russian rocket.
Generals argue that this time, we cannot speak of any failure.
The first two floors of the rocket resisted and the damage affected only the third.
In the previous cases, the engines had failures on the first floor.
Although none of the test launches have happened without crunch, the Department of Defence's management considers that only six out of thirteen were failures.
This success rate of nearly fifty percent thus fills the generals with optimism and they still claim that one day "Bulava" will fly smoothly and that it will take even ten hypersonic nuclear nuclei with a total weight of 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetissov signed a one-year contract with CSKA Moscow at 51 years of age
The legendary defender Viatcheslav Fetissov will again present himself in a professional game at 51 years of age.
The former champion of the world, Olympic champion and holder of the Stanley Cup will lend hand-to-hand to his CSKA Moscow team in need and will probably make his way in already during the Friday match against Petrograd.
Fetissov, who ended his career at the age of forty in 1998, is now the president of CSKA.
After Denis Kuliash's injury, we urgently need another defender.
Fetissov trains regularly and agrees to help the team.
We still need to settle some details on the form, says the coach of the club Sergey Nyemtchinov, quoted by the AP agency.
It was not specified whether the legendary hockey player's comeback will only concern one game.
I think Fetissov is one of those who are able to strengthen the minds of other players, Nyemtchinov said.
According to AP, in the case of his return to ice, Fetissov thus becomes the oldest professional Russian hockey player.
In NHL, the legendary attacker Gordie Howe played a whole season for Hartford and got 15 goals and 26 assistances.
The oldest of the famous quintet Fetissov, Kassatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best hockey players and among the most successful.
Under the colours of the Soviet Union he won twice the gold at the Olympics, seven world champions, he won the Canada Cup as well as the World Junior Championship.
In the second part of his career, he also collected tributes in NHL where he twice held the Stanley Cup.
He has been a member since 2001 of the temple of the fame of hockey.
Hyundai listened to the unions and cancelled all overtime
The management of the Hyundai plant in Nošovice agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime.
It is precisely because of the frequent overtime that trade unions have declared an emergency strike on Monday.
The spokesperson Petr Vaněk at Hyundai plant confirmed it.
However, management still wants to agree with trade unions on a Saturday worked this year.
We can't give up our production plan, it's essential, that's why overtime was proposed on Saturday, December 19 knowing there would be two teams, Vaněk said.
The site Sedmička.cz indicated that the company offered a 400 Czech crown bonus to employees who would be part of the Saturday team.
It will also be assigned later for the day worked on November 28.
The company, according to Vaněk, decided to change the way its employees are motivated in exchange for overtime.
Either they receive the supplement for overtime, or they can take a replacement leave on December 28th and thus extend their weekend holidays infirm Vaněk.
In addition, all employees present on Saturday will receive compensation for transportation costs and for their lunch.
In view of the fact that overtime was the most urgent and hottest point in the comments and claims of trade unions as employees who spontaneously stopped production last week, management made the immediate decision to cancel all overtime for December," said Vaněk.
Until last week, employees at the car factory were forced to work almost two extra hours daily in addition to their eight hours.
Trade unions intend to cancel the strike after signing the agreement.
The next negotiation between the management of the car factory and the trade unions must take place on Friday afternoon.
Trade union leader Petr Kuchař said Wednesday they were ready to stop the strike if they agreed on their claims and signed a common document.
The situation in the factory peaked last Wednesday when almost 400 employees spontaneously made strikes due to unceasing overtime.
They also protested against the bad conditions of wages and alleged bizutages.
Management defended itself with the fact that employees had to work extra to meet the requirements for car production.
When the strike was announced on Monday, trade unions also called for workers who had ceased production to be subject to no sanctions.
Trade unions ask the company to reduce the time spent by overtime to a minimum.
In addition, they want this year a pay of 5,000 crowns (209 €) for them.
Nošovice Hyundai car factory currently employs 2,000 people.
She started serial production last year in November.
It has manufactured about 80,000 vehicles until September of this year, with a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that works on HIV "endurant" viruses as well
A team of Czech and German scientists tests new combinations that can slow the proliferation of the HIV virus in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also acts on viruses that have already developed immunity to drugs.
This reality takes over in some cases the fact that the combination does not act as intensively on the current variants of the virus as well as some drugs already available.
It is not possible to cure AIDS at the moment.
However, the life of patients can be radically prolonged by a mixture of medicines that prevent the multiplication of the HIV virus in the body.
However, their consumption results in a series of side effects.
Moreover, the repression of this multiplication has the effect of developing what is called resistant viruses on which drugs no longer have an effect.
The work of experts from three institutions, the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the VŠCHT in Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to coping with the resistance of the virus.
They showed that substances called metalocarboranes act on the protein responsible for the multiplication of HIV virus.
Metalocarbons are a combination of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination blocks the development of the virus in a different way from all medicines used so far and that is why they could overcome the problem of resistance.
The work of researchers leads them to discover new "improved" substances, based on their knowledge of molecular mechanics of their links to the virus's proteins.
Metalocarbons have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multiple-walled cages are formed by boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms and connected by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
A treacherous and resistant virus.
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is indispensable to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV virus division caused by the HIV protease, there would be no mature infectious particles of the virus.
If HIV protease is stopped, the spread of the virus will also be stopped in the patient's body, explaining the researchers in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Czech Academy of Sciences.
In their work published in the journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cages (see table) are connected by a short organic chain, which is then systematically modified.
A little weaker but more reliable.
The effectiveness of this series of HIV protease substances has been tested in test samples as well as on its resistant variants obtained from HIV-infected patients.
On the current version of the enzyme, the effect of metalocarborans is not as strong as on clinical drugs, however, it does not weaken on the resistant versions against which current drugs are often ineffective.
Metalocarbons, with their unique mechanism of action and other properties such as their biological and chemical stability, their low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes, are therefore interesting combinations to consider further to develop effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína ★ezáčová, director of the structural biology laboratory of the organic chemistry and biochemistry institute and the molecular genetics institute of the Academy of Sciences.
The ODS takes it to Fischer, who defends himself.
The president of the SDO (Democratic Civic Party), Mirek Topolánek called the budget ratified for the following year "done" and according to him, the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should challenge its existence.
The Prime Minister qualified the SDO's words as a drastic verdict.
He says it takes time to analyze.
The spokesman for the ODS Petr Nečas stated that the idea of an administrative firm supported by the ČSSD, the ODS and the Greens Party obviously no longer worked.
According to Nečas, the head of government should decide whether the House of Deputies supports the minority who is concerned about combating the growing deficit, or whether he is concerned about staying in office with the support of the left-wing parliament.
Nečas warned that the positions of the ODS and the Social Democrats in relation to the problem of public deficits are diametrically opposed.
The House of Deputies ratified the 2010 budget Wednesday, but with proposals for amendments to the 12 billion crowns included on the left.
The House increased the money for civil servants' salaries, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's grievance to the proposals of the Social Democrats was that they indirectly increased the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic is expected to manage a deficit of 163 billion krona.
The ODS left the room before the vote, thus obeying the government's wish that an amended budget is a less bad alternative than an interim budget.
Disappointment and futility
The Minister of Finance Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of futility, Prime Minister Jan Fischer indicated that the government will still consider the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota threatened to leave office in the event of ratification of the proposed amendments, the situation might be different.
According to Czech Television, Janota made an appointment on Monday with the Prime Minister after his visit to the government:
He also indicated that he was wondering if he would remain in his duties.
His disappointment at the negotiations around the budget is the reason.
If Fischer decides to continue to combat the budget deficit, Nečas believes that the representatives of the ČSSD, who imposed the changes in the budget, do not have their place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House ratifys other laws that increase the deficit, such as those that affect health insurance, pensions, or reform of the Services Act.
Topolánek: Ministers appointed by the SDO are not in question.
This is the case of the Chief of the Fischer Government and the whole government.
Ministers appointed by the SDO have done nothing harmful, said Topolánek in a textual communiqué from the United States.
He recalled that the deputy ministers of certain departments claimed TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decides to resign in the face of a fight against the amount of the public finances deficit, "it is quite logical and correct that it is based on the left-wing majority that is currently in the House."
That said, he must not expect the support and tolerance of democrats.
I didn't think about it and once it's on the agenda then I'll dedicate myself to it, said from the House to journalists, Defence Minister Martin Barták, elected by the Democrats to the government.
Prime Minister Fischer flew in the afternoon for a debate at the European Council in Brussels.
The SDO went back to the Prime Minister's request.
Nečas also stressed that the SDG would probably have voted against the amended budget on Wednesday if it had not specifically asked the Democrats to allow the budget to be voted on.
We do not have the feeling that we are orphans, that we are not small children, that we have responded to the question of whether the SDO had not been criticized by the Speaker of the Party in the Chamber or in the country during the budget negotiation.
I did not notice that my vote would have been missing.
I already knew at the time when I renounced my mandate that what would follow in the following months would be a fallout of the House and a destruction of all that was positive, Topolánek responded in person.
According to the new ČD schedules there will be fewer trains for identical rates.
The Czech Railways will eliminate or limit from 13 December some less-charged express or regional trains and will strengthen some less-charged trains.
Total transport coverage will decrease on the day of entry into force of the new two-percent schedules compared to today.
Most rates will not change, including base rates and reduced rates.
For example, it is the inhabitants of the Ostrava region who will have more links to the capital, the Railways will add a pendolino branch.
On the contrary, an expression will cease serving Bratislava.
There will also be less fast trains on the line Prague - Písek - Česke Budějovice, the direct line Prague - Letohrad will be radically reduced.
At the regional level, the largest reduction in transport concerns the Hradec Kralové region by eight percent in total, but Prague and its surroundings can welcome an increase.
Two night trains on the line Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice are also cancelled and the circulation of some express trains on the line Prague - Písek - České Budějovice will be reduced to only a few days a week.
Among the biggest changes is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague: for the time being Milovice residents have to change to Lysá nad Labem.
This is the fifteenth line of the Esko suburban system, whose opening is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line between Lysá nad Labem and Milovice.
The distant lines to the capital will have their final destination at Prague Main Station (Praha Hlavní nádraží).
The ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino lines between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will leave at two-hour intervals.
Travelers will no longer be able to take the Pendolino until Bratislava from December 13.
This year's bill for regional railways: 200 million additional crowns.
Express trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport and will pay to the Railways next year in all four billion crowns to settle visible losses, the same amount as this year. Regional trains are commanded by the regions that will pay for them by a total of eight billion next year, knowing that the state will participate to almost three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The Railways have recently signed a contract for ten years, so far the duration was still one year.
The Railways appreciate the system, which also explains that they did not use a price increase of the vast majority of transport titles.
The changes will only affect one-day tickets ČD Net and reduced-price internet tickets eLiška.
For travelers without a discount card, the price of ČD Net will increase from 450 to 600 krona.
The price of eLiška will again depend on the journey, while so far it was valid between cities in a region of choice and was at a single rate of 160 krona.
The Filipino rebels still hold more than 50 people, the children have been released
The rebels today abducted 75 people in the south of the Philippines, including a few primary school students and their teachers.
It was the AFP agency that informed it, but that it originally spoke of only 65 hostages.
The 17 children were released after eight hours, as well as one of the instructors.
Hostage took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
It is reported that approximately 19 rebels have used hostages as human shields during an escape from the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to find an agreement for the release of the remaining hostages.
According to the AFP agency, the rebels belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the military branch of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AFP agency, the police first continued the raptors as a result of violence caused in a settlement of accounts between two family clans.
The martial law was declared in the province of Mayondanao in the south of the Philippines because of a recent massacre during which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre linked to the governor's administration elections were 30 journalists.
The governor of this province of the southern Philippines was arrested following suspicions of participation in the massacre, as well as his father Andal Ampathuan, patriarch of the influential Ampathan line.
Mindanao Island also includes active Muslim separatists.
However, they have renewed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The history of South Africa concerns everyone, according to Morgan Freeman aka Mandela
The new Hollywood film by Clint Eastwood arrives in the American halls in the coming days, the title is Invictus (the official Czech title is Invictus: Neporažený), and narrates part of the life of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-renowned apartheid fighter returned to Morgan Freeman, who was selected years ago by Mandela himself to incarnate him.
The second male role of the legendary South African rugby champion was attributed to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in the halls, the returns of critics and the public are heard.
Nelson Mandela
His full name was Nelson Rolilahla Mandela.He was born on 18 June 1918 in Mvezu, South Africa.
In 1988 he won the Sakharov Prize for his freedom of mind, and in 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize alongside Klerk.
He was President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film contains great hopes since it is presented at a time when South Africa is in full preparation for the World Cup of Football, and on the other hand because the media are agitated by worrying news about the increase in racial conflicts and discrimination of the inhabitants by the black majority in power.
According to the AP agency, reactions to the new film are currently rather positive in South Africa, despite frequent reservations to the main roles where Hollywood stars "pavanent".
Morgan Freeman is, however, proud of the film by his own words.
I've dreamed of this role for many years and I've prepared myself well.
I have also met personally Nelson Mandela many times to be able - as we say - to recover from his energy, he indicated at the first official of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it's a good thing if you have the opportunity to remember Mandela's personality and message through the film.
This is the story of the Republic of South Africa, but it concerns every individual has added.
Wearing the jersey of the national rugby team
The film based on the history of the novel by the British writer John Carlin is freely translated. In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the play that gave his creation to the people depict the South African human rights defender during his term as president.
Morgan Freeman therefore tries during the film to collect two racial groups from a long-divided population, and so did Nelson Mandela in 1995 in the national jersey of the South African team on the lawn of the world cup, which South Africa had won at the time.
In order to have shown itself on the lawn in a suit, which is considered something sacred in South Africa, Mandela had been extensively ovationized fourteen years ago mainly by the white public and was recognized by white populations.
Hopefully, the football championship will succeed in bringing people together again into one nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" of the national team in 1995.
It remains to be seen whether the tense South African situation will improve.
However, South African whites are sceptical as they have recently been assigned in an interview for LN Christopher Dawson, a rugby fan who fled to Britain.
The championship begins on June 11, 2010.
A transformer worth tens of millions of fiery crowns in the Louny region
In the morning a transformer of the Čeps company from the distribution center near the municipality of Výškov na Lunsku was consumed by a fire.
According to Lukaš Marvan, spokesman for the Ústí firefighters, there are six units operating on the fire.
They originally intended to let the transformer consume themselves, but they reviewed their opinions and extinguished the fire with a mixture of water, foam and special substance.
The cause is a technical defect, an internal short circuit of the transformer.
No one has been injured and according to the spokesman of Pavla Mandátova the incident does not endanger the secure operation of the transmission set.
Damage is estimated at a few tens of millions of crowns, the exact figure may be known once the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandátova, the destroyed transformer will have to be replaced by a new one.
It adds that in ten years of activity Čeps has experienced nothing similar and that such incidents are isolated.
Electricity supplies have not been interrupted, states the spokesperson for the company ČEZ for North Bohemia Soňa Holingerova Hendrychova, the operation of households, administrations and industries has not been influenced by the fire at the processing station.
A.s. Čeps is the exclusive operator in the Czech territory of transmission sets and electric lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renews and develops 39 distribution stations with 67 transformers transferring electrical energy from transport sets to distribution sets and traces of lines with a length of 4339 kilometres.
Jančura will file a complaint for defamation against three ČSSD Prefects
Radim Jančura, owner of Student Agency, is now filing a complaint for defamation against three democratic social prefects.
And concretely against Michal Hašek of the South Moravie region, against Radko Martínka of the Pardubice region and against the Prefect of the Olomouc region Martin Tesařík.
Jančura indicated it in Dvacet minute from Radiožurnál.
The complaint is related to the company's attempt to operate regional railways in certain regions.
All regions, however, ended up signing long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three attacked us and claimed that we made fine mouths, while we only made an offer for what they themselves wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways which is not true because we know the prices of the Czech Railways that were signed last week.
So we only have to defend ourselves.
In exchange for the slander of Student Agency, Jančura told Radiožurnál.
He also indicated that there was evidence that no regions had done in accordance with European law.
We are preparing for this a complaint for the European Commission.
Hašek considers that Mr. Jančura's filing of a complaint represents the continuation of his media show which serves as a free advertising for his company and for his person.
Of course I am willing to defend my name and the name of my region and I call the other prefects to do the same.
I suppose this will be an opportunity to show clearly that it is precisely Mr Jančura who manipulates public opinion and uses false and misleading arguments about regional rail transport, says Hašek
Jančura has already informed last week that he will invest a few million crowns in an advertising that will mention the unfavorable approaches of the regions.
He told Radiožurnál that he would interrupt the campaign after Christmas and he hoped to resume it after the New Year.
He pointed out that the campaign will target corruption in the broad sense.
Jančura began his campaign after the regions agreed to entrust the Czech Railways with the operation of railway links for an order of approximately 150 billion kroner, without issuing tenders.
According to Jančura, such action is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions even brought threats from a Member of the ČSSD to Jančura.
The only threat was that if we didn't stop, we could lose our bus licenses.
He presented himself as a Member of the ČSSD, I don't know who this is, but I won't say his name, Jančura told Radiožurnál today.
Pneumococcal vaccination will be free and optional
Vaccination against pneumococces will reverse old habits as early as January.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families.
Votes are already being raised, saying that mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococces culminate.
The pharmaceutical institute already defines for vaccines the maximum prices that health insurance will pay.
Specialists are also clear in the vaccination process.
A new vaccination.
Free vaccines for children in August.
Since January, children born last year from August 2 can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococces.
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated.
If vaccination has started last year or earlier, the following vaccinations will have to be paid by themselves.
The first dose of vaccine should be administered between the third and fifth month of the child.
Last year a quarter of the families voluntarily vaccinated their children against pneumococces.
However, parents paid 1600 crowns or even more for one dose.
The vaccination of young people requires four doses.
Experts estimate that each year health insurance spends 300 to 450 000 crowns in vaccine doses.
However, they save on the medical care that children who are not vaccinated would require.
To date, the State had spent about 500,000 krona per year on all child vaccination.
Reimbursed vaccination was introduced with the Janota package.
Pneumococces are the cause of inflammation of the middle ear but also of serious infections including inflammation of meninges and blood poisoning.
According to hospital surveys, there are up to 28 deaths of children under 10 years of age due to pneumococcal infections.
In addition to the Czech Republic, approximately 40 other countries have introduced refunded vaccination.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
There are opinions on a possible future vaccination obligation.
From January, it must be settled by insurance and optional.
For example, the president of the Nahlas Rudolf Kalovský association indicated that mandatory vaccination would be more positive.
Its association has long promoted vaccination against pneumococces.
At an international conference in which our association participated, the specialists were not really satisfied with the fact that we have an optional vaccination.
It's not ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy that we could have imposed at least this.
I think it is a direction that must now be followed said Kalovský.
But the Department of Health does not want to change the pneumococcal vaccination process.
We do not think about it at all for the moment, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
Optional vaccination has its drawbacks, doctors say.
Hana Cabrnochová, president of the Specialized Society of Paediatrics, recognizes that vaccination based on volunteerata's shortcomings.
If all children were vaccinated, a decrease in vaccination renewal could be considered "In the situation where the vaccine costs such an amount I understand the decision making the vaccination optional," says Cabrnochová.
Specialists predict that from next year, more than 80 percent of new parents will have their infants vaccinated.
Vaccination against pneumococces is also a rupture because it is the first vaccination of children funded by insurance and not by the State.
Cabrnochová explains that insurance should release funds for prevention, thereby saving on possible future medical care.
Doctors will have to buy their own products
This is, however, linked to the concerns of practitioners, who are concerned with the purchase of vaccines.
The original intention was to have vaccines purchased by insurance, with doctors receiving them in the same way as other vaccine products supplied by the State.
Some Members however feared that this would allow insurance to "deduct the amounts of health insurance".
For example, doctors will have to buy the products and wait for insurance to pay them back.
It is estimated that paediatricians will have to invest almost 40,000 krona per month in vaccines individually, which is a significant amount.
It'll be far from easy, according to Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved in a "Museum Flight"
Frank Frazetta's son, a recognized illustrator, was accused of trying to steal paintings worth $20 million (12 million GBP) in his father's museum.
In Pennsylvania, police stated that Alfonso Frank Frazetta had been interrogated while loading 90 tables in his vehicle and in a trailer.
According to her, Mr. Frazetta and another man used a mechanical leather to force the entrance to the museum, in the Pocono Mountains region.
Mr. Frazetta Senior, aged 81, is famous for his drawings of characters such as Conan le Barbare and Tarzan.
At the time of the incident, the artist was in Florida, reported the Associated Press (AP) press agency.
AP cited a police officer who stated that young Mr. Frazetta may have been motivated by a family dispute.
According to a police statement, 52-year-old Mr. Frazetta Jr claims to have been authorized by his father to "enter the museum, by any means, to carry the tables into a storage facility," the agency reported.
Mr Frazetta Senior denied such authorization, said the agency.
Labour defends the increase in the budgetary tax.
Ministers defended the increase in tax and reductions in expenditures announced in the pre-Budget report, despite criticism of opposition, business and trade unions.
The Tories stated that Alistair Darling "missed" an opportunity to show that he was serious about reducing the deficit by reporting his decisions until after the elections.
The Chancellor also attracted lightning by addressing low wages and average wages.
Its main proposals include an increase of 0.5% of Social Insurance and a ceiling rate of 1% on public wages from 2011.
The anger of social insurance
Trade unions protested that low wages are penalized by a recession they are not responsible for and warned that "problems" were announced.
The decline in social insurance - which will achieve about GBP 3 billion a year - has made the world angry, because he believes it is a tax on jobs while the objective should be a boost in the economy.
The increase, reserved for those who earn more than 20,000 GBP per year, will reach about 10 million workers.
MAIN POINTS OF THE PRE-BUDGET REPORT
Social insurance will increase even 0.5% as of April 2011
The economy will fall further than the 4.75% expected this year
New 50% Tax on Bankers Bonuses
The increase in corporate profits tax for small companies has been abandoned
Discount of taxes on electric cars and wind turbines
Increase in pensions by 2.5%
According to Treasury estimates, a person earning 30,000 GBP will lose 90 GBP per year and a person earning 40,000 GBP will lose 190 GBP, while a person earning 10,000 GBP per year will gain 110 GBP additional.
Ministers stated that their goal of halving the deficit before 2013 was "hard decisions" but insisted that 60% of the additional taxes would weigh the first 5 percent of the employees.
Stephen Timms, the Secretary of the Treasury, rejected an increase in the tax and stressed that a decrease in expenditures was a "water drop in the ocean" compared to what was needed.
"These figures are important, and they will allow us to divide the deficit by two, which will be absolutely essential over the next four years," he said to the BBC.
Mr. Timms said that he was confident and that the growth of the economy would resume by the end of the year.
However, Labour's forecast of economic growth - which will influence the amount it will have to borrow and the speed at which the deficit will be filled - was questioned after the Chancellor was forced to revise his first figures.
In his speech, he said that the economy would probably fall by 4.75% this year - much worse than the decline of 3.5% predicted in April - while borrowing would be 3 billion GDP above the previous estimate.
"Opportunity Missing"'
The Conservatives who will launch a new advertising campaign against Labour's "debt crisis" said that the project to borrow GBP 789 billion over the next six years was not viable.
Ministers failed to present a credible plan on how to repay, did they add, eluting "cynically" difficult choices until after the elections - to be held in June 2010.
"They didn't present anything significant about what they were going to do," said Philip Hammond, Chief Secretary at the Ghost Cabinet Treasury. "They had the opportunity to do it and they missed it."
" Important announcements will be made after the elections, regardless of the winner "
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from further reductions, contrary to Tory's proposals that would result in a faster and more significant reduction in the deficit.
But Lib Dems stated that the money collected through increased taxes and lower spending would be used to support next year's spending rather than to reduce the deficit, claiming that the plans were "built on the wind".
Nick Robinson, the BBC's political editor, said that the schedule of announcements - such as the increase in inflation for certain disability benefits in April, mentioned above - would leave the Chancellor to face charges of propaganda, with money simply recovered the following year.
However, Labour insists that additional assistance is provided while people need it most and that the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"Failure to budget"
Although the ministers did not publish the details of expenditures beyond 2011, economists stated that it was clear that restrictions on public spending would only begin to be felt in the medium term.
The highly respected Institute for Tax Studies (Institute des Etudes Fiscales) stated that the Chancellor's figures in the future involve substantial reductions in many areas, potentially including transport, higher education, science and defence.
"The pain is actually delayed," said his director, Robert Chote.
"The most important announcements will be made after the elections, regardless of the winner," added Roger Bootle, Economic Advisor to Deloitte's accountants.
"This was a fake pre-budget report.
The FBI investigates "American arrests in Pakistan"
The FBI investigates the arrest in Pakistan of five U.S. reporters suspected of extremist links.
Men were arrested during a raid in a house in Sarghoda in the eastern province of Punjab , announced the American Embassy in Pakistan, BBC.
The FBI said it was investigating whether it was the same men who had been declared missing from their home in the U.S. state of Virginia last month.
The U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs said he was also looking for information about these people.
Three of them are presented as Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
If they are American citizens, of course, we would like to know what the charges against them are and what conditions they are in," said the spokesman, Ian Kelly.
Katherine Schweit, the FBI spokesperson said that the agency had known about the arrests and that she was in contact with the families of missing students.
"We work with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and nature of their activities there, and if it really is the students who are missing," she said.
Pakistan's Embassy in Washington stated that the men had been arrested in a house owned by one of them's uncles.
She said that the house was already monitored by the local police and that no charges had yet been brought against the arrested men.
The Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton refused any comments on the arrests, reported the Reuters press agency, but stated that the United States should "work more with Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to root out the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people".
The five students had been taken missing from their home by their families, in Northern Virginia, at the end of November.
Amnesty condemns Iranian "abuses"
Over the past twenty years, human rights have been as little respected as ever, according to the Amnesty International report.
the report presents "repetitions of violations" by the regime, before and after the campaign of the June presidential elections.
One man quoted in the report claimed that he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another said he had been threatened with rape.
Iran denied previous criticism regarding its non-compliance with human rights.
The authorities stated that such criticisms were politically motivated.
Thousands of people were arrested and dozens were killed in Iran, after the contested election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad led to the largest public demonstrations since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
Dozens were sentenced to prison sentences and prosecutors claimed that at least five persons had been sentenced to death.
Jon Leyne, BBC correspondent in Tehran, now in London, claims that at the beginning of the protests, the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, the authorities have tolerated no criticism, says our correspondent.
"Fashion confession"
Amnesty International reported the case of a 26-year-old computer student, Ebrahim Mehtari, who claimed to have been accused of 'Working with Facebook networks' and protesting against election results.
"They often hit me in the face," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes, under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... they threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left in the street, always in blood and half conscious," said Amnesty.
In August, the candidate who lost the election, Mehdi Karroubi, claimed that demonstrators detained after the election were tortured to death in prison and that others were raped.
The Iranian authorities denied the charges of rape, but admitted that abuse had taken place.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee who said he had been locked in a container with 75 other persons, for more than eight weeks, in a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty agreed that the Iranian Parliament and the judiciary set up a committee to investigate post-election disorders and the government's response, but stated that the mandate and powers of these agencies were unclear and that the results of the parliamentary committee had not been made public.
The group said that at least 90 persons had been arrested in the last three weeks in order to prevent further demonstrations.
Ski slopes built in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow has been used to transform Bristol's site into a racetrack.
The eventPiste in the Park (A runway in the park) attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders in competition for species prices.
At the top of Brandon Hill Park, a small climb preceded a 100m long track.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said that the top view of the track was magnificent but that it was quite intimidating.
It is a magnificent view, with all the lights of the city shining down.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country - real talents," he added.
Prices have rewarded the best volts - or figures made on the track.
After Thursday night's party, the snow will be abandoned at the fountain.
Always them and us
Can Islam be French?
pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be attracted by this new book, admirers of the author's latest book, "Why the French don't like scarf" (2006), an elegant and well-documented study of a problem that has divided and worried the country for about fifteen years and whose effects are still felt today.
Mr Bowen's latest book presents a much wider and more ambitious plot.
Good anthropologist, he not only wants to know what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is happening in the country today.
He spent many months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide in France what Mr. Bozen calls "Muslim spaces" for the 5m-6m Muslims.
He was very good at listening to and reproducing discussions between teachers and students on the issues most relevant to them.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or in the city hall (or both)?
Should the evolution and rights of homosexuals be taught to young Muslims?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim?
Can a Muslim use an interest-based banking system to obtain a loan?
These are practical problems, he says, which are the daily lot, rather than the political dramas that concern the media.
The author identifies a new generation of magnets, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They don't push the debate to the end.
Conservatives do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam.
The intellectuals and activists who have been interviewed by Mr Bowen are generally in agreement with their counterparts lawyers of a Purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, which today constitute a small part of the Muslims of Europe.
Mr Bowen believed that the values of Muslims and the secularity of French could be compatible.
But a compromise can only be achieved with the efforts of each camp.
He wondered how much French politicians (and the so virulent intellectual elite of secularism) were really committed to pluralism.
According to him, Muslims were not spoiled, compared to Catholics, Protestants and Jews who also had to make historic compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than growing pragmatism, it detects a "closeness of key values".
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, we are tempted to say "yes, but not yet."
The Darkest View in the World
The Arctic changes faster and more dramatically than any other place on the planet.
The ice that composes it is melting at an alarming speed, bringing with it a life that cannot survive elsewhere.
Oil, gas, shipments and fishing navigate in new open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their silage.
In "On a thin layer of ice", Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, painted a natural history of the symbol of the great north, polar bear.
Aware of the history and complicated policies of whale fishing, he described the long tradition of Arctic explorers who proved themselves by hunting white bears.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson, then brave aspirant of 14 years who had nothing to fight but the tip of his musket, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The young bears, captured while swimming next to their mother, just killed, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, a famous performance brought together 75 bears at the same time.
Even today, the dimensions of a zoo are still generally one millionth of the area necessary for an adult in freedom.The climate is rarely indicated: a polar bear living in Singapore has become green due to algae that grew in its thick fur.

Mr. Ellis told the stories of other writers and historians and often returned to the threat that hunters posed to species survival.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, killings continue in Greenland and Canada where helicopter hunters and Inuit motorcycle hunters use powerful assault rifles to hunt their game.
Ironically, the ice will remain in the northernmost waters of these two hunting nations for the longest time.
In his new book, "After the Ice", Alun Anderson, a former editor-in-chief of New Scientist, offers a clear and frightening summary of Arctic science and an exciting overview of what the future may be there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmosphericists nor oceanographers can accurately report the speed of changes.
It's not necessary to try.
At the end of the 19th and early 20th, the pioneer travels of Fridtjof Nansen gave the first information on the melting of the ice cap.
The submarines of the cold war then mapped the changes of relief under this.
Satellite surveillance and probes placed on icebergs are of great help, but the biggest of the work is done by hard men, camping in the cold.
Mr. Anderson contemplates the extraordinary and tiny world of the Arctic ice-dependent system, formed by pressurized saumâtre water nets by freezing.
But from the bears mentioned above to the microscopic wonders contained in the ice, everything will be lost with the disappearance of the summer ice, planned between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months, maybe it'll be our turn"
Marines, out of the 6,000 people who deposited crowns on the graves in Arlington
The first class of 19-year-old Angello Robinson made a seven-hour bus trip to place a single crown on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, North Carolina to the Arlington National Cemetery Cemetery Cemetery Cemetery Cemetery Cemetery Cemetery Cemetery, this day was devoted to greeting men and women who were once in their place.
In a few months, from where we will be sent, we risk being in their place, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If it happened to me, I'd like someone to do the same for me, which is why I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of the 6,000 volunteers who gathered on Saturday morning to lay crowns on the graves of the veterans, in different sections of the Arlington Ceremony cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, launched the commemoration and others decided to decorate several hundred graves in the Arlington Ceremony cemetery.
Now, to continue an 18-year-old tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen, make the journey every year, stopping in different cities on their way, to organize commemorations in honor of the soldiers and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit association, Wreaths Across America, which aims to promote the event in all other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns on the graves of the Arlington cemetery around the Pentagon on the graves of the Fayetteville National Cemetery cemetery in Arkansas, in the Battery Park in New York City and on the site of the memorial for victims of United Airlines flight 93 to Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second consecutive year, the Walmart Foundation provided more than $150,000 to purchase and transport crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said she had made the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a career soldier who died.
Although her husband was not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that for her, this gesture was a way of thanking those who had sacrificed themselves.
It's a small gesture that civilians can do to support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Emmitoufled in several layers of warm clothing, volunteers walked between lawns and the wide hills of the cemetery.
Volunteers chose ancient graves, dating from the First and Second World War, as well as the Vietnam War, because they are not as often visited as the new graves, said the organizers.
The mood was optimistic, while the children played and the couples held by their hands, carrying the crowns of fresh pine on the grey graves.
Each round crown had a dark green color, with a small red butterfly knot on top.
Closely, he was planning silence on Section 60, where most war veterans in Iraq and Afghanistan are inhuminated.
The United Service Organizations gave 1,000 crowns to decorate the section but the dark mood of the current wars filled the area.
Individuals cried without hiding, others prayed, and families and friends supported themselves in the cold air.
Some were reading aloud the names engraved in the stone while others were looking to see the small black and white information cards, embedded in the wet ground for those whose grave had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers in tears on her son's grave.
She was part of Zanesfield, Ohio, and had taken eight hours to gather on the grave of Marine Sergeant GunneryDavid Shane Spicer, who died in battle in July.
No one should ever forget what we're free of... my son paid for it, she said.
"Long after I'm gone, I want someone to remember him."
An American citizen arrested by the Cuban authorities
The Cuban government arrested an American national who distributed mobile phones and laptops in the country, said the US Ministry of Foreign Affairs services.
The national, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
The consular authorities as well as the U.S. Interest Section in Havana are trying to access the prisoner who was arrested on 5 December.
The precise charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be arrested on the pretext of being "dangerous".
All so-called revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical writings, pose the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a growing community of bloggers, led by Yoani Sánchez, a popular commentator who often writes about how they are husband and she is followed and harassed by government officials.
Sánchez has made several requests to leave the country to receive awards but the authorizations have always been denied.
The detention of an American national may increase tensions between the communist government of the brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration that pursues a "soft" approach to improve relations with the island.
The announcement of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times on Friday evening.
The new American policy insists that the Cuban government move forward through concrete steps, such as freeing political prisoners and creating more space for the opposition, so that the United States can do the same.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although new and desired consumer goods in a country or an employee's average salary is $15 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban government has granted ordinary citizens the right to purchase mobile phones; they are mainly used for texts or for a 15-minute conversation that corresponds to a payday.
On the island, the use of the Internet is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and for foreign visitors in the country, as well as in some government buildings, such as universities.
Cubans who wish to connect often must communicate their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the few Americans imprisoned in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, says Gloria Berbena, a press attache to the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said she could not provide more information about the arrest.
Arrest and detention are a big mistake.
An activity that, in any other open society, would be allowed -- distribute mobile phones free -- is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Director of the Americas programme of the Human Rights Watch group, who recently published a severe report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, even Cuba", referring to the installation of Raul Castro as leader of the country to replace Fidel, his sick older brother.
According to Vivanco, an accused is often arrested, tried and imprisoned on the same day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often caused a negative reaction in the United States, when both countries began to start a better dialogue.
Pakistani authorities prevent a plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities identified an organization supposed to prepare a plot to send five men from Northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill American troops, saying they hoped that this would allow for the dismantling of a large network of terrorist recruits who are emitting the Internet in search of radicalized young men.
The investigators claimed that they were hunting a hidden insurgent personality, known as Saifullah who invited these men to Pakistan after discovering them when one of them made comments approving terrorist waves on the YouTube video website on the Internet.
Upon arrival in Pakistan, these men were led by Saifullah, who tried to help them reach the remote area of Pakistan's tribal belt, home of al-Qaida and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani Secret Service representative who was informed of the case said on Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince al-Qaida commanders that these men were not involved in the CIA's plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were isolated for days in the eastern town of Sargodha, far from the forbidden mountains of the north-east, became a refuge from terrorism.
They were considered as infiltrated agents.
For this reason they were rejected, said a representative of the authorities who expressed themselves under the condition of keeping the anonymity due to the confidential nature of the case.
The representative of the authorities stated that men were determined and that they were always trying to obtain the necessary authorizations to obtain entry into the al-Qaida camps when they were arrested by Pakistani law enforcement.
The case of these five men -- who remain in Pakistan and are interviewed by the FBI -- insists on the crucial role of recruiters in identifying potential and perhaps more important terrorists, in determining the people in whom they give their trust.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, the US secret services have had the priority of infiltrating men into the al-Qaida network.
The recruiters of the organization play the role of gatekeepers, refusing entry to those who do not show a serious commitment and those who may prove themselves spies.
According to analysts, potential American recruits are closely studied by al-Qaida.
But they are also very attractive to the group because of their potential access to American targets and their propaganda value.
However, Evan Kohlmann, an expert from the US-based NEFA Foundation, said that terrorist groups must also pay more attention in recent years to the choice of people they accept because US secret services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you're trying to infiltrate someone into these groups, what better way to follow their recruitment model than so many other people have already followed? said Kohlmann.
The model is the one that is increasingly on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of Protestants in Copenhagen demand "action" for the climate
Tens of thousands of Protestants walked down the streets here, Saturday, demanding more action on the climate from the negotiators working in the palace of the Bella Convention Center congresses of the city.
The number of demonstrators was estimated to be 100,000, but 25,000 were estimated by the police.
This event took place relatively peacefully, although a small number of masked activists lit some explosives near a set of government buildings in downtown.
On the day that little happened during the discussions on the climate sponsored by the United Nations, thousands of activists walked through the city, carrying banners in English saying 'There is no planet B' and one in Spanish, declaring 'The Earth says it has enough'.
Several celebrities joined the protests, including the Danish top model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that traveling to her mother's home country, Peru, had opened his eyes to the heartbreaking problems facing the country due to the impact of the climate change that is already taking place."
That's one of the reasons why I've decided to join the big move -- to get the word out and to call on the leaders of the world to make fair, ambitious and committed decisions, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be undertaken, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
The police prevented demonstrators from coming too close to Bella Centre and said that she had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they wore a mask or that they were in possession of pocket knives.
The police prevented demonstrators from coming too close to Bella Centre and said that she had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they wore a mask or that they were in possession of pocket knives.
According to a passerby who asked to keep anonymity due to its involvement in climate discussions, activists wearing black masks and clothing have lit several explosives near the main Copenhagen channel that is surrounded by a few ministries.
They threw them near the buildings, he said, adding that these were first rockets, followed by "some big explosions".
Inside the Palais des Congrès, people were gathered around television screens to follow the walk throughout the afternoon.
But it seems that demonstrators have failed to raise awareness of key authorities such as Su Wei, China's climate representative.
When he was asked if he thought that a demonstration would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English: "In fact, that's something I didn't know about.
He then continued in Mandarin, declaring "The event being important, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He observed that walking might seem harmful or useful from the perspective.
It shows the interest of the general public and the various sectors in the area of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they disrupt negotiations or damage the freedom of others."
The results of the tests reveal tenacious differences between the races
Last week's federal report on mathematics results brought good news to Washington D.C. public schools.
Although the District remains still far behind the head institutions, the report shows that Grade 4 and Grade 5 (cm1-cm2) are in much greater progress in the previous two years than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But the latest figures of the National Assessment of Education Progress are the persistent gap between the results of African Americans and whites on both local and national levels.
The average results of Grade 4 (cm1) white children in Washington, D.C. have increased over the past two years from 262 to 270 (on a 500 scale), but those of their African-American classmates have only increased by three points, from 209 to 212.
The success gap actually increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African Americans in Grade 8 (4th) remains generally constant, falling by only one point, from 245 to 244.
The average white result was not included in the test results as the sample was not large enough.
The overall view of a six-year period is no longer encouraging.
In 2003, the difference between black and white in Grade 4 (cm1) class, when the first District NAEP report was published, was 60 points (262-202).
Although the results obtained by children in both groups increased during this period, the difference was reduced to only 58 points.
Last week, some defenders in the District expressed concern that the increase celebrated by the Group of Educational Institutions Director Michelle A. Rhee and the Mayor, Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) were driven by white students who were already good elements.
That would mean that we raised the aggregate by considering the elements at the top of the scale, which is problematic and embarrassing, said Jeff Smith, Director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that defends equality in the education of the District.
I do not jump for joy for one or two points won, said Kwame R. Brown (Democratic relative), Member of the Council of D.C. and whose daughter is in Grade 4, at Eaton Elementary (Elementary School).
Often critical of Rhee's management style, Brown stated that the test results message is that the city's middle schools (colleges) desperately needed attention.
Really, you always want to see the positive signs and I respect them.
But what's scary is that we don't devote enough time and energy to our middle schools.
Rhee stated that the District should continue to find better ways to respond to the needs of students in difficulty.
This fall, for example, some teachers were trained to use a new method of reading, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at students in the elementary and early school classes who did not integrate the bases of reading earlier into their school careers and who are quite late from their peers.
Every day, the math program, for Kindergarten (Maternal) classes at Grade 6 (6th) focuses on real-life games and experiences, as they were set up in the District by former leader Clifford Janey, who must also be credited for the progress of the NAEP reported last week.
I just think we need to continue to work to provide better interventions to these students below the level of the class," said Rhee.
Others believe that NAEP's results raise the question of whether Rhee can continue to raise overall system outcomes while providing money and resources for schools with less results to reduce the gap.
It is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a teacher at Berkeley University in California who studies the results of city tests.
The conventional political solution is to devote your resources and management reforms to schools in the poorest districts of Washington.
This focus can also have political implications that hinder this important program.
But the problem, of course, is that like other School Superintendents, she tries to use the middle class of whites and blacks.
We focus on developing a system of good schools.
We need to strengthen our neighbourhood schools so that all families, no matter where they come from, are assured that their children can get excellent public education.
Janey, now School Superintendent of Newark, said in an interview this week, that one of the essential elements to reduce the gap in success was the duration of the traditional public school, today 180 days in the Washington District, to compete with the Charter schools.
It takes about 200 days to have the strength to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with his teachers' union last year to get 185 days, which he considers to be a "start point" to achieve further an increase in the next contract.
Making higher education a promise for the future
The bus stopped at Gettysburg College with a long whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, goes down and blinks a moment in the eyes of white columns, brick facades and green lawns.
Graciela's parents had only been able to finish high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
So, while she and other Grade 8 (4th) students from the group explored Gettysburg where the tuition fees are $38,690 a year, her attitude was less that of an impressive new student than enthusiastic.
Super That's where I'm going to study! Graciela exclaimed who would like to study medicine, while the guide directed them towards the entrance of the science building.
Youpi, really? she said thoughtfully, when she was told the low ratio law teacher - student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that children visited during their three-day discovery trip and now they had completely integrated the message: The question is not whether you go to university:
The question is where.
Although this issue is still widely raised for the large number of American children born to Hispanic immigrant parents who left the high school where they became parents in their teens, they are also hundreds of thousands to benefit from university education that will allow them to enter the middle class.
In fact, "a "second generation Hispanic" in five of his high school studies -- a remarkable success if one considers that both their immigrant parents, most of Mexico or Central America, have entered the United States without completing the high school.
Their success is important, researchers say, they pave the way for the next generations that will play an important role in the country's workforce.
Researchers who study the batants claim that they have a natural affinity with the school and an innate need to succeed.
Many parents also set high targets for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
Mentorate programs also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her to reach university -- especially if her efforts are regular and long-term.
When you look at the children of low-income families with parents who have no experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention, at any time, will not help them, said Patricia Gándara, researcher at Davis, University of California, who studied Latin American students.
We must consider providing a network of support for these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded the visit of Graciela universities is a good example.
Known as GEAR UP (prepare you) , it provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems to organize university preparation programs that begin when students of low-income families are middle school (school) and continue until the end of high school years.
Since 1999, the program has been followed by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent entering the university, according to the U.S. Ministry of Education.
Iraqi Ministry of Oil obtains agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has succeeded in attracting major oil companies to rebuild its infrastructure in difficulty during two auctions that ended on Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil with foreign oil companies suggest that the oil companies in China, Russia and Europe are about to play a major role in the rehabilitation of the oil industry in Iraq, invalidated by dozens of years of war and sanctions.
U.S. companies went out with participation in only two of the 10 fields auctioned.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction that started on Friday.
The only one who made an auction lost.
Two U.S. companies were awarded contracts for field auctions in June.
The low representation of American oil giants in the opening of the oil sector in Iraq surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors, after six years of war, and instead of American companies, there were Asian and European companies opening the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum forum, an Internet news site.
It will take a long time before another offer is made in Iraq.
The security concerns, corroborated by massive coordinated bombings, Tuesday, and political instability as the US military troops retreated, prevented them from entering Iraq with more force, which has the world's third largest crude oil reserve, say analysts.
American companies were, in some cases, disadvantaged by their rivals, particularly Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, whose labour costs were significantly lower and who were more willing to take risks because they did not have to report to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobile and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies to obtain contracts with the Department.
The most important American companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have maintained strong ties with and provided technical advice to the Iraqi Ministry of Oil, have broken their hands.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The Chinese National Petroleum Corp., held by the State, has been more interested in contracts than other companies and has left with significant participations in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological power, said Assam Jihad, spokesperson for the Ministry of Oil.
We are confident that Chinese society will be equal with its competitors and will fulfil its commitments in Iraq.
Pre-selected companies for auctions made offers that were then compared to the tariff per barrel that the department agreed to pay to motivate production above the current levels for each field.
One of the main organizers of al-Qaida was reportedly killed in Pakistan
It appears that an American missile, having hit the border with Afghanistan, killed one of the organizers of al-Qaida's operations this week, declared on Friday by the U.S. counter-spyping authorities.
If the information is confirmed, it would be the second murder attack against one of the terrorist leaders this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arab men suspected of being killed by a pair of missiles launched in their car on Tuesday, near the city of Miran Shah, in the province of North Waziristan, according to American sources and Pakistani authorities in the region.
Local authorities stated that missiles had been fired by a non-pilot aircraft of the type used by the CIA within the anarchist tribal border of Pakistan.
They drove a white car, headed towards the Afghan border, when the car was hit, declared a member of Pakistan's secret civil services speaking on the phone of Miran Shah.
The representatives of the authority stated that the suspected local militants rushed on site and quickly confiscated what was left of "totally torn bodies".
It was totally impossible for local authorities to verify the identity of the victims, but the two U.S. anti-terrorist representatives provided unspecified evidence that Somali was part of the deaths.
Somalia was described as one of the military organizers of al-Qaida who led the terrorist operations of the group outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
His role was to organize conspiracy around the world, he affirmed one of the authorities who wished to keep the anonymity, citing the sensitive nature of the air strikes within Pakistani territory.
Given its central role, this probably included conspiracy of attacks against the United States and Europe.
He followed the strategic instructions of the leaders of al-Qaida and translated them into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second representative of the U.S. authority stated that Somalia had made rapid progress in the ranks of al-Qaida's and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to the American public, but this does not diminish the threat he poses to us and our allies, said the second official representative.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second major character of al-Qaeda or the second Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a militant faction in the tribal belt, as well as three other operators.
The pace of attacks by CIA drones has declined since the summer, from about six operations per month to two, according to the figures advanced by the Long War Journal, a website moderated by a non-profit group.
This decline may be due to improved tactics of terrorist groups that have progressed to reduce their vulnerability while also ruthlessly killing suspected informants, says the site.
UN Special Envoy to Kabul retires
UN Special Envoy Kai Eide, Afghanistan, stated on Friday that he would resign from his post in March, at the end of a tumultuous mandate filled with widespread allegations of corruption during the United Nations-backed presidential elections.
Eide's departure occurred when the Obama administration decided to send 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan.
The United Nations envoy said he supported this increase but expressed concern about the United States timetable for withdrawal of troops beginning in 18 months and forcing other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the Afghans the right signal and remind them that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a Kabul telephone interview.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international officials assisting the political transition to Afghanistan.
The military increase must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide stated that he did not resign but that he would simply respect his commitment to his family in March to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to prevent the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows that he has time to find a replacement.
I just said it was better to start looking for my replacement, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month gap between my predecessor's departure and my arrival.
According to UN representatives, Ban has already started looking for a replacement.
Representatives claim that the name Staffan di Mistura was cited; it is an Italian-Switzerland citizen who recently presided over a United Nations mission in Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led the United Nations peacekeeping operations.
The reputation of Eide in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of favouring President Hamid Karzai during the presidential elections and concealing evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied these allegations, but he stated that Galbraith's accusations -- which he thanked -- "have harmed the mission because there was already a good dose of skepticism with regard to the international observation of the elections."
Eide stated that he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the help of the US forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the United Nations officials to allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries than he was assigned to the mission in Afghanistan, saying that this would give them more confidence in the way their money is spent.
Eide expressed frustration over the limits of his powers in Afghanistan, saying that the United Nations' heavy hiring regulations hindered his ability to bring new talent.
The rules of the United Nations are such that I have been able to recruit only one person since May, he said.
It's catastrophic and it can't last.
Gates: Iran must undergo additional sanctions
The Secretary for Defence, Robert M. Gates said Friday that the great world powers would soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because of his inability to engage in talks on nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking in front of a midwife of 300 American soldiers in northern Iraq, during a week's visit to war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, dedramatized the eventuality of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to the question of a soldier on the eventuality of such a outcome.
One of the things that weighs me the most, is that if I have learned something in Iraq over the past six years, it is the unpredictable side inherent in war.
The Obama administration considers a set of sanctions that would target Iran's military and political elite, but Gates noted that some of these sanctions could also affect street Iranians.
He said that "a set of motivations and punishments" might be necessary to persuade the Iranian government that it would actually be less safe with nuclear weapons" because "their people would suffer enormously" from these sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by the spokesman for the White House, Robert Gibbs, the administration joined the European leaders in a warning that Iran would face "probable" consequences if it did not bring its nuclear programme back into full compliance with the UN Security Council and its monitoring body, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Iran continues to say that it wants to develop its nuclear experience only for a peaceful purpose.
In the Geneva talks, on 1 October, he indicated that he would resume the dialogue on the reduction of his nuclear programme and agreed to abandon an important part of his enriched uranium storage, in exchange for fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has led to such an agreement, a means of building trust on both sides and making time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran appears to have been far away from attempts of agreement - in part, experts say, because Iranian leadership is divided on whether or not to engage with the United States.
Frankly, in my view, the strengthening of Iran in the face of some of the international community's proposals for which they had actually agreed at the beginning of October, prompted the international community, including Russians and Chinese, to join what they had not envisaged, in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, said Gates.
President Obama set a deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals on 31 December before turning to other options, including the continuation of what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "increased sanctions".
In a statement made in New York on Thursday, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what it calls "unfounded allegations" by some members of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear activities and affirmed its agreement to continue talks with the United States and five other major world powers, "in order to achieve a satisfactory long-term solution".
Gates, who was scheduled to return to Washington late Friday, met in the morning, Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, before taking the plane for the rich oil region of Kurdish to meet the troops leaders in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
Tensions persist between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly regarding borders, property rights and income sharing.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential conflict in order to avoid any delays in American plans to reduce the number of American troops, from 115,000 to 50,000 before the end of August.
Gates also wishes to calm the anxiety of the Kurds about the pending withdrawal. The US authorities quoted Gates saying to Massoud Barzani, President of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will preserve your security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq".
We will not abandon you."
In aging China, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up around propaganda posters teaching them, "The Mother Earth is too tired to welcome more children" and "An additional baby, it's an extra tomb."
They learned so well that the authorities of the Government of Shanghai, alarmed by the insufficient birth rate of their city and by the ageing population, have radically changed direction this summer and began to encourage young couples to have more than one child; their reaction was instant and firm: never.
We have already given all our time and energy to one child.
We don't have a second left, said Wang, 31, Director of Human Resources and who has an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the single child's policy in China, creating two generations of unique children notoriously with good toys and spoiled, nicknamed the "small emperors", a population crisis threatens the country.
According to the United Nations, the average birth rate fell from 1.8 children per couple compared to six when the policy was implemented.
The distribution of the population, while it is expected that the number of residents aged 60 and over will explode, from 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 per cent in 2050, well above the overall average of about 20 per cent.
This imbalance is even worse in rich coastal cities with a highly educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 per cent of the population of residents registered in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, Director of Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission stated that fertile couples should have babies to "help reduce the proportion of the ageing population and prevent a lack of labour in the future".
Shanghai is about to become "old - but not as rich, however - as developed countries such as Japan and Sweden" she said.
Progressive mitigation
Written in the country's constitution in 1978, the Chinese policy of the single child is, without a doubt, the most controversial obligation introduced by the Communist Government.
Couples who violate this policy may have to pay huge fines -- up to three times their annual income -- and be discriminated against in the workplace.
The Chinese authorities assigned the police the duty to help the country avoid a dangerous tendency for its natural resources, while human rights lawyers denounced abuses in the implementation of this policy.
In rural areas, some representatives of the authority forced pregnant women from a second child to have abortion.
In addition, many couples have used selective abortions leading to an abnormally high ratio of boys.
In recent years, the authorities responsible for the population have gradually softened their position on the policy of the single child.
In 2004, they granted more exceptions to the rule -- including for city residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases where men and women are already single children -- and in 2007 they softened many of their harsh slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, professor at the Institute of Population Research, at the University of Beijing, said that central government authorities have recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one partner is a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In no time, posters encouraging families to have only one child were replaced by copies of detailed regulations that have the right to have a second child and how to apply for authorization.
The city government has dispatched family planning officials and volunteers to meet couples, at their homes, and to drag prospectuses under their doors.
He also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who wished to have more than one child.
According to the family planning manager, the response was disappointing.
Disappointment response
Although leaders in a rural Shanghai suburban town say they have seen an increase in requests for couple files wishing for a second child after the launch of the campaign, the more urban district reported that there was no change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, still receives only four to five applications per month.
Shanghai officials, disappointed, say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to be only about 165 000 -- slightly higher than 2009 but less than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the Family Planning Committee in the Municipality of Caolu in Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children.
They want to provide their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years old and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26 years old, said that they would love to have two children and that they were legally allowed to do so.
But like many Chinese, they have only minimal health insurance and government life insurance.
Without social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
Westerners wrongly consider the policy of the single child to be a rights problem, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is pregnant for seven months of the first child of the couple.
That's right, we're stealing the chance of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just the law.
It's money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons to explain their hesitation.
Wang, Human Resources Manager, said she only wanted a single child because she was one herself. "We were the center of the family and used to be the one that everybody took care of us."
We don't usually take care of someone else and we really don't want to take care of others."
Chen Zijian, 42 years old and owner of a translation company says it more sharply.
For couples working at two, middle class, who lower the birth rate, he said, it is necessary to be selfish to succeed.
People aged 20 or 30 grew up watching their parents fight in the early days of capitalist China and don't want to have this lifestyle themselves, he says.
Even one child takes a lot of time from his parents, he says.
A mother must give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are the problems of space -- "You need to change your apartment" -- and planning -- "When your child is only nine months old, you need to write his CV to get a place in the best kindergarten."
Most of his friends are ready for this experience once, says Chen, but not two.
Our generation is the first to benefit from a higher standard of living, he says.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
The United Nations Group has draft emission reduction plans
The conference on climate, sponsored by the United Nations -- characterized so far by disorganized allocations and mutual recriminations -- has returned to the light of the ramp on Friday, due to the publication of a document highlighting the ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations supporting most of the burden, in the near future.
The text that could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases highlighted the remaining obstacles, as well as the path to be taken.
But it has been seen as an important step forward in the time-consuming negotiations, with more than 100 world leaders coming to Copenhagen next week.
Drafted by a United Nations ad hoc working group, the text does not say how much rich countries would give the poor to support climate warming in the long run and in the long term.
And it offers a wide range of options for key issues, including how developed economies and new emerging economies could reduce their carbon production and what would be the upper limit of the global temperature increase that those responsible would be willing to tolerate.
It gives great flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, Representative in Washington, Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who wrote six pages of the document, studied a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the Executive Secretary-General described on UN climate change, Yvo de Boer, as "the complete image".
It shows the guidelines for a possible agreement in which industrial nations would collectively reduce their emissions by 2020, from 25 to 45 per cent compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries, during the same period, would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 per cent.
Together, countries would reduce emissions between 50 and 95 per cent by 2050.
The European Union has also relaunched negotiations on Friday by promising to provide $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change -- to withstand floods and drought or to avoid deforestation.
However, on Friday, the same verbal changes have occurred, which have dominated the negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, United States Representative for Climate Negotiation, rejected any discussion requiring the reduction of greenhouse gases by industrialized countries, compared with voluntary efforts by major emerging economies, if these were not funded by developed countries.
This change is the signal that the Obama administration becomes tougher to China than the Bush administration was, two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without efforts and actions of the major developing countries, says Stern, who also regretted that the text does not insist enough to ensure that reductions could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after the Chinese Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, He Yafei stated that the US main negotiator, either lacked "good sense", or was "extremely irresponsible" for saying earlier in the week that the United States would not financially help China to combat climate warming.
With the future economic paths of the major world powers at stake, there have been flaws in both the third world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is more about saving individual economies than saving the planet, with China and the United States complaining about their respective obligations while the poorest nations insist that the two dozen most influential countries ignore the scientific imperatives to act more courageously.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it was not surprising that the major powers were fighting to know who should suffer the costs of reducing greenhouse gases, even though vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in their attempts to make the major emitters responsible for their actions.
It is really a game in which a new economic hegemony is developed, said Ulate, who is also climate advisor for Mexico and Central America for International Conservation.
Some of these countries more vulnerable to the impact of climate change have indicated that they would continue to put pressure on a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the major participants say that negotiations will lead to a minimum of political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which brings together 43 members, drafted a 24-page treaty proposal early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, Head of the European Commission's Climate Unit, said that the action of small island states has "put political pressure on the complete political process", partly by what they are now unified and ask emerging economies such as China and India to act.
Discussions became an urgent matter, while delegates focused on the fact that they had to solve most of the problems before the Heads of Government reached agreement.
High-level officials such as the Indian Minister of Environment, Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister came down from their aircraft and rushed into the Bella Center building to attend closed meetings and briefings, in order to be able to make claims that will be examined during the following week.
The true image of the gathering -- in which 13,000 people come in and out of the Congress Palace every day -- guitar-player activists show night performances mocking countries that they think are betraying themselves and that proposals are written and distributed on paper rather than by email -- is a real challenge.
The intensity only increases: almost all important ministers are here and no later than Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We enter the courtyard of the grandes, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice-President for the World Conservation International Policy.
Heavy weights are coming.
In Britain, the first train at 225 km/h will redefine the Monday syndrome
At 5:13 a.m., Monday morning, a whistle will strike at night to signal the departure of a train that will mark a transport revolution in Britain.
The country's first high-speed suburban train will reach 225 km/h, while it will line from Ashford, Kent, London St Pancras, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, will be joined by Dame Kelly Holmes on the first train from Javelin suburb outside London.
He hoped that the new service would enable Britain to integrate an international network of fast and reliable trains and connect the large conurbations of the Midlands, North and Scotland in London.
The small lost holes will become thriving suburban cities, the duration of business trips will be much less long and the transition from the plane and the car to the train will reduce national carbon emissions while reducing traffic congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties adhere to this project.
But the ten billion pounds needed to build a new railway network, the inevitable battle of planning and the fears of danger to the environment are likely to slow down British high-speed lines.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to produce a feasibility report for the government, will deliver its document to Lord Adonis on December 30.
This will allow you to obtain a detailed map of the route of the next step for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn within five metres of the urban area and sites where the impact on the environment may be controversial.
In the countryside, the plan will be drawn up to 25 metres from the final route.
HS2 is also expected to present three options for a higher speed network, heading north.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred options are highlighted in a Y configuration for which a high-speed line will go up to the West Midlands.
The line will split in two or near Birmingham, with one branch going west from the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another heading north-east towards Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line will cross Scotland.
"It seems that this will be the best performance option," said a rail professional.
When this is completed, the travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first branch, which will not open before 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to an hour-long journey.
The proposals will allow the train to travel to 400km/h, making the UK network the fastest in the world.
The initial track is designed to allow 400m long trains and can carry 1100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can operate on a London - Birmingham line.
A terminal that could accommodate 20,000 passengers per hour would be necessary.
Given the space constraints, it is expected that an existing station will be expanded to receive the high-speed network.
Rail industry experts state that only St Pancras International or Euston offer this possibility.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he believes that the project should take place, but longer public consultations and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be taken before a general election.
Even if it launches the machine, the network will have to be built part by part.
Trains will first be required to drive off high-speed lines on existing tracks north of Birmingham, maintaining travel times between London and Scotland longer than three hours.
This solution seems to be the best way to ensure a transition from planes to trains, which is a reference point for rail revolution.
The taxpayers repay the 75,000 GBP loan for the Tory Orangery
Alan Duncan, the chief member of the Tory Parliament, paid the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year to pay the cost of an orange shop he built in his constituency home.
The party leader who was retrograded by David Cameron for complaining that the members of the parliament were "maintenus", increased his debt by GBP 75,000 to build a oak extension at his second home in Rutland.
He had been authorized to have the additional interest paid, amounting to hundreds of pounds per month, to the taxpayer.
The common authorities received complaints at that time and were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who carried out control of members' expenses. Last night, Mr. Duncan stated that complaints could not be "clearer or simpler".
Duncan, one of the richest members of parliament, owns a two-storey house in a village of his Rutland - Melton constituency.
The neighboring houses were sold for almost a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the Emoluments office states that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a veranda to the house, describing it in his plans as an orange tree.
Neighbors describe it as a "viranda for pleasure".
Mr. Duncan was not requested to provide an explanation for the increase in borrowing during a recent investigation by the Committee on Common Privileges and Standards concerning its provisions for prior borrowing.
The Committee innocently charged him last month with any charge of non-compliance with the rules, after an investigation into his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan modified the legal security of the 271,406 GBP of his London property at the house of his constituency which he purchased in 1991, the year before becoming a member of the parliament.
The documents published this week show that Mr. Duncan required approximately GBP 1,400 per month of interest in borrowing up to March last year.
In April, its applications increased by more than GBP 1,800 per month.
The interest rate on Mr. Duncan's RIB borrowing was not changed at that time, suggesting that all increases were intended to finance the debt of GBP 75,000.
The RIB standard interest rate has increased from 7.94 per cent in December 2007 to 4 per cent in March, this year, without moving since then.
The latest publication by the Commons authorities showed that Mr. Duncan continued to apply for GBP 1,250 in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his position as Phantom Cabinet Officer in September, after a covert journalist allegedly filmed him stating that members of parliament were to survive "on budget" after the spending scandal.
"In fact, it's a national now, you have to live "on budget" and you're treated as "m...e"
He said, "I spent my money on my garden and asked for a small part, based on what was right.
And I could have asked for more, but I didn't."
The member of the parliament, a millionaire since his former position as an oil merchant, began to explain his expenses in May, after he appeared to have asked for thousands of books for his garden, before agreeing with the cost office that it "could be considered excessive".
An activist dug a pound-shaped hole in Mr Duncan's lawn to protest after it was revealed that he had requested 4,000 GBP for three years.
Asked about the increase in borrowing last night, Mr. Duncan said: "It was for capital improvements, approved both by the fees office and then by Legg."
He added: "There is no problem with rape or the development or use of rules or anything.
It was quite clear, in the rules, authorized, etc.
It couldn't be cleaner or simpler."
Faithful, come and see the Calendar of Brighton's Advent
Brighton beach cabins have found a new way of promoting for winter months, an interactive Advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their cabin for every December day, using Christmas songs as a theme.
The event began on December 1, while visitors were allowed to visit the last cabin, from 5:30 to 6:30 a.m. every day, with pasta and hot wine served free of charge.
The songs of Christmas selected so far include "I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Christmas", for which the cabin presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50 years old, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an unpaid priest of the diocese of Chichester and Director of Beyond.
He said: "We want religion to be closer to people in a post-Christian society.
"As a Church, why do we expect people to enter a strange old building? It seems to me that the Church should approach people and celebrate more captivatingly.
"The idea of the Advent calendar of the beach cabin came right after a conversation with some friends during a dinner.
Brighton is such a creative and vibrant place and we try to experiment and represent it through spirituality."
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world for climate
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against climate warming throughout the world and in Copenhagen, where the police have conducted several hundred inquiries.
At least 30,000 people, according to the police, hundreds of thousands according to organizers, paraded in the cold in the Danish capital in the margins of the United Nations Conference on Climate, which is responsible for reaching an agreement on 1 January 2013 by Friday.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish president of the climate conference, the growing mobilization on climate around the world, illustrated by these events, helped to make the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital occurred shortly after the departure of the court, when a group of 300 protesters, fully dressed in black, broke windows with paving and hammers, found a PFP journalist.
Anti-emittance police officers immediately intervened without movement.
In total, the police announced the interrogation of 600 to 700 people, mainly members of "the Blacks Blocks", these ultra-violent groups that had illustrated themselves at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
The Climate Justice Action Coalition (CJA), one of the organizers of the event, denounced the conditions under which hundreds of militants were interrogated "without distinction", stressing that one hundred of them "were always held in the street Saturday night "mented and held in a position seated despite extreme cold".
Part of Parliament, the court, rather good child, took over the Bella Center, the negotiating site.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 metres from the building, without attempting to enter it.
A scene had been set up to welcome the expected speakers, before a candle-watch with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
Most demonstrators had come in and out of the major cities of Europe, but many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Almost 3,000 people, mostly in impermeable blue sky, had formed a first gathering in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of Friends of the Earth, who intended to form "blue tides" for the "justice for the climate".
Today, we go down to the streets to ask for repair of the ecological debt in favour of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We cannot continue to say: we have time, we have estimated the Beninese Angélica Kidjo singer.
There are rivers drying up in Africa, rivers where we can walk like we've never done before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the United Nations Convention, the alterglobalist movement has drawn close to environmental organizations.
The French Euro MP José Bové, a figure of alterglobalism, explained that he came to Copenhagen for "climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no cut between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world".
The Asia-Pacific region, which houses many islands that are particularly vulnerable to warming, had given rise to demonstrations.
Some 50,000 people, according to organizers, had come down to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, paraded in red, flying bandanas boasting solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, but also in Canada, meetings of a few hundred protesters have also been held to demand strong action against climate change.
In France, the events organized by the "350" network brought together a few hundred people, including in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
In Geneva, a few tens of people gathered.
Separatist Abkhazia elected its president, Georgia denounces a "farce"
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, a little over a year after Moscow's recognition of this pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia, while Tbilisi denounces a "farce".
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in this first election after the Russian-Georgian War of August 2008 for the control of South Ossetia, another Georgian secessionist territory recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 17:00 GMT.
The participation rate was 58% a few hours before closing, according to officials of the Abkhaze Election Commission.
The first provisional results had to be announced on Saturday night to Sunday.
The five candidates in high school, including the outgoing president, Sergei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemned the holding of the vote.
These elections are a farce.
For his part, Georgian President Mikheil Saakachvili "wrestled that Abkhazia had fallen under the total occupation of Russia," said his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladzé.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it a part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After being separated from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, which has killed several thousands, Abkhazia seeks to show through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a step in our new life, our new era as an independent state, told AFP Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, who claimed to have voted for Mr. Bagapch.
She was among the voters who visited the polling station in a school in Soukhumi, the capital, in a beautiful white building with some palm trees in front of the entrance.
The issue of Russian domination is at the heart of the Presidential in this region in the sumptuous landscapes on the Black Sea.
Large panels showing Mr. Bagapch alongside the Russian President and Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin are located a little everywhere in this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the west of the country, the head of the district, Beslan Archba, has provided a warm welcome to the Russian officials who came to monitor the conduct of the election.
We, the Abkhaz people, are grateful, said during a small ceremony, alluding to Moscow's support, in particular the decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, answered Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament, lifting a glass of vodka.
For its part, the opposition represented by former Vice-President Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticises the agreements concluded with Moscow last year, such as the one giving up control on the Abkhaz railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, claims neither to support the current power nor the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus a vote is necessary to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round must be organized within two weeks.
Climate: World events, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people have traveled around the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement at the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where the police, on the living one, have interviewed nearly 700 people outside of an imposing demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to the police, hundreds of thousands according to organizers, paraded in the cold in the afternoon in the Danish capital, which welcomes delegates from 193 countries until 18 December, seeking an agreement that will enter into force on 1 January 2013.
Part of Parliament, the court, overall good child, took over the Bella Center, where negotiations take place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 metres from the center, without trying to enter it.
A scene had been set up to welcome the expected speakers, before a candle-watch with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the departure of the procession, a group of several hundred protesters, fully dressed in black, equipped with bricks and hammers, broke windows, noticed a PFP journalist.
The riot police immediately surrounded them and intervened without any movement, throwing several of them to the ground.
The police announced the inquiry of 600 to 700 people, stating that they were mainly members of "the Blacks Blocks", these ultra-violent groups that had illustrated themselves at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
At the end of the afternoon, a police officer was injured in the jaw by a pavement and four cars burned near a squid during incidents that led to the arrest of about 20 people, according to the police.
We have the extremist groups, had warned the police spokesperson Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the law enforcement forces were turning to the sky.
The majority of protesters, who came by train and by train from the large cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam or Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Almost 3,000 people, mostly in impermeable blue sky, had formed a first gathering in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of Friends of the Earth, who intended to form "blue tides" for the "justice for the climate".
Today, we go down to the streets to ask for repair of the ecological debt in favour of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We cannot continue to say: we have time, we have estimated the Beninese Angélica Kidjo singer.
There are rivers that dry up in Africa, there are streams where you can walk while you have never done so before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the United Nations Convention, the alterglobalist movement has drawn close to environmental organizations.
French Euro MP José Bové, a figure of alterglobalism, told the AFP to come to Copenhagen for "climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no cut between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world".
The Oxfam organization has mobilized several personalities, including the Danish model Helena Christensen, the former United Nations Commissioner for Refugees Mary Robinson, who had to address the crowd.
The Asia-Pacific region, which houses many islands that are particularly vulnerable to warming, had given rise to demonstrations.
Some 50,000 people, according to organizers, had come down to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, students for the most part, have shown, dressed in red and flying bands boasting solar energy in front of the city hall of the Philippine capital.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, meetings of a few hundred protesters were also held to demand action against climate change.
In France, the events organized by the "350" network brought together a few hundred people, including in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
In Geneva, a few tens of people gathered.
The Géo history is reinforced by the reform of the general high school, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education Luc Chatel stated in an interview to be published in the JDD Sunday that history and geography were "reinforced" from the reform of the general high school, despite the abolition of their compulsory teaching in the scientific terminal.
Now, first-class students will all have four weekly hours and the same programme for a shared common culture, says Mr. Chatel.
For the minister, "you have to get out of hypocrisy" because, according to him, "S line is no longer a scientific line" but "in general, it concentrates on the best students".
The ES and L lines cannot remain sub-directories of the S, he continues, stressing further: "I have also not heard much of historians and intellectuals to be aware of the absence of terminal geography history in technological high schools".
Saturday, an Ifop survey published in Humanity revealed that almost seven French out of ten (69%) disapproved of the government's project to suppress the compulsory teaching of geography in terminal S. Many intellectuals and teachers have also criticized this suppression, as well as the left and some right-wing elected.
On the other hand, the Minister added that it was not "no question" to delete the philosophy of terminal program S.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and unions) called for a Tuesday day of mobilization to protest against the project, which they felt sacrificed the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), they will pass an eligibility test in the beginning of the year that will lead to their discipline, then at the end of the year an admission test that will focus on their ability to teach, explained the Minister.
They will also follow internships during the year of M2 and will be a first year in front of students as trainee teachers.
If you add all the proposed internships before the competition, you already get more presence in front of the students, or more than 300 hours, he continued.
Finally, the Minister indicates that he will propose "the individual right to training, which does not exist in National Education".
He also reaffirmed the project to delete the school card "by 2012".
At Normale Su, experts have 15 minutes to convince about the climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about the issues of the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge raised on Saturday morning by Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Panel of Experts on Climate Change (GIEC) invited by the Ulm Street High School.
Jean Jouzel, also a Nobel Peace Prize, opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, a day consisting of a chain of expert interventions, every 15 minutes, filmed and open to the public, observed a PFA journalist.
We wanted to do something that caught people and they wanted to know more, explained on the margins of the 22-year-old Edouard Hanneo conference, one of the organizers of this day who took his name from the one given by the students to the fish in the school basin.
Some twenty participants were selected from among the experts in their discipline and were selected for their charismatic side, he said.
Regarding climate warming, "we can talk about hours, but we can also talk about key objectives in a few minutes," said AFP Jean Jouzel, who expressed himself without notes, but using graphics, in front of about 50 people.
This is part of our role as a scientist, he stressed, hoping that the auditors will hold that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an extremely serious scientific dossier".
The videos from these conferences will be posted online on the school's website from December 15th.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled in February, followed by others at a bimonthly pace.
Delays in payments: anger of prison supervisors, planned actions
The prison supervisors' unions called on Friday to "general mobilization" to demand the payment of premiums and overtime by the end-of-year holidays, which were rejected in January for budgetary reasons.
FO- penitentiary (2nd union of supervisors) asked staff who will not be in service to manifest Tuesday morning in front of prisons and "block" them to "report the theft of their dues".
The CGT-penitentiary (3rd union of the profession) calls on them to "convene in general assemblies in the various prisons for strong mobilization", finding "honest and unacceptable" the non-payment in December of "additional hours, night premiums, Sundays and holidays" worked in October.
And the first union of supervisors, the Federal Autonomous Prison Union (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for general mobilization (...) to raise discontent and anger".
The Directorate of Prison Administration and the Department of Justice explain that overtime increased significantly in 2009 and not all were budgeted, but ensure that the reliquats will be paid in January.
The Chancellery said at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a mail to the union supervisors guaranteeing that this payment would be made next month.
I do not know the efforts provided by staff for the operation and modernization of our prison system, the Minister of Justice writes in this letter.
I have asked the prison administration to implement without delay a set of measures to ensure that this situation arising from a poor assessment of the number of overtime does not recur in the future, says Alliot-Marie.
The December pay will therefore be slim, except for management staff benefiting from the famous prizes of duties and objectives, deplored the Ufap/Unsa, for whom "budgetary constraints have good back".
It was a scandal, the interregional union FO de Marseille was outraged, announcing its decision to boycott until the new order "all meetings and convocations".
Staff will not come to work on their Sundays and holidays if those of October are not regularized in December, ideal for overtime, also threatens FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when our tasks and missions are increased without increasing our staff, it is more than regrettable to dare to take the money from the staff, according to the Bordeaux CGT-penitentiary.
According to trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some being less bad than others.
But anyway the account is not there, he found the Secretary General of the Ufap, Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says to offer "prettyr structures" than the ones he receives
American President Barack Obama, who is about to spend his first Family Christmas at the White House, entrusted the "papes" of the little Oprah Winfrey screen that he had a simple gift rule: "I give things nicer than the ones I receive."
As part of a special show that will be broadcast Sunday night on the ABC channel, the president and his wife Michelle provide an overview of how they intend to celebrate the year-end parties in their new and prestigious stay.
Even Bo, the small four-legged companion of the family will be on the side.
Father Noël also loves Bo, said Michelle Obama, stating that the dog would have "of course" a gift, according to excerpts from the broadcast in advance.
And Michelle Obama took a false stand against her husband's assertions about the quality of the gifts he received: "Surely not, I offered you nice gifts last year," she teased the president.
Absolutely, he was forced to grant before replying with humor by showing from his finger the pearl necklace of the First Lady: "Who offered you this?".
During this one-hour show, in the relaxed atmosphere, with the famous cheerleader who was a fervent support of Barack Obama during the presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favorite gifts as children.
Barack Obama referred to a 10-speed bike, but also a basketball that his Kenyan father rarely saw him offer him to Christmas.
I remember this time when I met my father who came to see us for Christmas and where he gave me a basketball, said the president.
It was only later in my life that I realized it was him who gave me this ball.
The First Lady remembered her side of her dollhouse.
I really didn't know how to organize a house so I had aligned all the furniture against the wall, rather than fix it around the fireplace, but I loved this little doll house, said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday re-operated, RTL claims he's in an artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was re-operated in Los Angeles due to significant "damage" after an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his surroundings, while RTL claims that the singer was placed in an artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was re-operated on the night of Wednesday to Thursday at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles after the American doctors had found "injuries resulting from the operation" of the discal hernia suffered in Paris on 26 November, he indicated in Paris his press service, stating that these injuries had "needed a restorative operation".
However, the singer's press service wanted to reassure itself that the situation was "under control", while a new medical bulletin would be provided within 48 hours.
According to RTL, partner of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday would have been plunged into an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications".
It is only in 48 hours that we will have a little more certainty about the patient's condition when he opens an eye, adds RTL.
Questioned by the PSA, the press service did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also claims that "according to certain sources" no drain would have been placed after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated at Monceau Park International Clinic for this discal hernia.
The intervention, scheduled for several days, had been carried out by the neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux , a well-known doctor in the arts community.
This was not available Thursday night to comment on RTL information.
Following his operation on Johnny Hallyday, the singer was hospitalized on Monday at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles for an infection following the intervention.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, thought on Thursday that his friend was going through "a bad pass," but assured that he was "no concern" for the rocker, who is "a wrestler".
He had called me just before he left for Los Angeles, and I told him it was bullshit because it took twelve hours on the plane after such an operation, it's not playable, said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, wished to reassure himself that Johnny Hallyday "reacted satisfactorily to antibiotics" and that the infection was "indicated".
Mr. Camus also said he had met with Laeticia, the singer's wife, and had not noticed any particular concern.
But the singer's health problems have only multiplied since July when he was hospitalized for nine days following a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, to the general surprise, Johnny Hallyday had revealed that he had been operated on with a "small colon cancer", then with a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed his long "Tour 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem has been widely discussed. Fans and journalists have noticed the difficulties of the singer moving on stage.
In mid-November, her entourage even had to deny a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/small basin: the first of Bousquet on its fetish distance
The French Frédérick Bousquet, a triple World medalist in the Grand Basin-2009, won an international title on Thursday on a distance he particularly loves, the 50 m free swimming, during the Euro-2009 in small basin in Istanbul.
The first day of this competition where the combinations are allowed for the last time saw only three records of the world beat while waiting for a postponement.
One was improved by Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto on 200 m 4 swims and the other two by Russia in relays 4x50 m 4 swims.
A regret for Bousquet, which ran on the world record of 50 m free, whose brand holds the large basin (20.94).
On one of the two queen distances of swimming, the 50 m free, it was the 28-year-old French who imposed itself in 20 sec 53 in a final where ten swimmers took off against eight usually, a first at the international level.
Bousquet preceded the Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84) but failed to lower the world brand (20.30) as he had envisaged.
We can always dream better and in the event, I said that if the world record was within my reach, I was going to try.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers were dressed in polyurethane combinations, which will be prohibited from 1 January.
At the beginning of 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations ended their epic in Istanbul, which had welcomed the first in 1999 during the same competition.
The use of the combinations did not serve this time German Paul Biedermann, a double world champion in the great basin this summer in Rome, world record to the key.
The young swimmer failed to lower the brand he holds over 400 m free swim (3:32.77) but nevertheless stood by signing the second best time of his career (3:34.55), in front of Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn't give up on this race.
I knew I couldn't beat a world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and accomplished my mission.
Lobintsev will be a serious rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
USA: a sarcophagus panel belonging to Zola awarded $1.5 million
A Roman sarcophagus panel belonging in particular to the French writer Emile Zola was awarded Thursday $1.5 million, clearly above his estimate, announced Sotheby's art dealer.
This panel before two meters long on 63 cm high, dating from the third century after Jesus Christ, was estimated to be between $150,000 and $250,000.
The marble "representing four dionysian scenes in a sophisticated architectural décor, surrounded by satyrs and bacchants, is a rare piece, there are only four or five of them in the world," he explained to AFP Tuesday Florent Heintz, vice president of the art auctions of Roman and Egyptian antiquity at Sotheby's.
It was sold in a hundred lots.
The sale is still underway, but this lot is certainly the one on which buyers have most dear so far, indicated to the AFP a spokesperson of Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy.
The discovery of the acquisition of this marble by Emile Zola dates back to a few days.
The panel remained almost 300 years in Rome in the famous collection of the Borghese family, then appeared successively at the French actress Cécile Sorel, who had made it an element of his bath in his particular Parisian hotel, and at Paul Reynaud, Minister under the III Republic in France and briefly President of the Council before the accession to power of the Pétain Marshal.
There remained a shadow zone of about 50 years.
Looking at the Louvre Museum's database, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of an "Emile Zola Succession" opened in 1903, one year after the death of the author of "Therèse Raquin" and the fresco of "Rougon-Macquart".
Aborted departure attempt from Zelaya from Honduras to Mexico
Mexico considered on Thursday that the conditions were no longer met for the transfer to its territory of the deposed President of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, who was denied an exception-led by the putschist government.
At the moment, after a telephone conversation in the night with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that the possibilities for this transfer are not met, Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa said.
Arrived Wednesday to Salvador to bring Mr. Zelaya back, the plane of the Mexican government returned to its place of origin, according to a source of the Migration Branch.
The putschist government wanted to force Mr. Zelaya to "resign" and request political asylum abroad to grant him an exemption.
But the fallen president refused, because he wanted to go to Mexico as head of state in guest exercise.
The putschist government "has experienced a new failure by wanting me to give up my responsibility (...), they wanted me to resign," said Mr. Zelaya on the Globo radio, which he has often expressed since the beginning of the political crisis that has lasted for five months in the Central American country.
I can stay here ten years, here I have my guitar, added by playing some agreements the fallen president, refugee at the Brazilian Embassy of Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Embassy of Mexico has submitted a request for a leave of absence, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain a request for asylum, declared on Wednesday the Minister of the Interior of the Putschist Government, Oscar Raul Matute, on Honduran radio HRN.
I didn't ask for asylum from any country, answered Manuel Zelaya in an interview with Telesur, whose seat is in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras should be made as President of the Honduran people, he stressed.
Mr. Zelaya's departure rumors had mobilized on Wednesday the supporters of the fallen president, who came to gather around the Brazilian Embassy, where the military strengthened their headquarters.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the position of the putschist government.
This demonstrates the marginal nature of this government vis-à-vis international standards, he said.
Zelaya, who had approached the Venezuelan Socialist President Hugo Chavez, had been overthrown on June 28, on the day he had held a popular consultation to prepare his re-election against the opinion of the Supreme Court, the army and the Congress.
Exiled in Costa Rica, he returned by surprise on September 21st and took refuge at the Brazilian Embassy.
If he leaves, he will be arrested for responding to the crime of "high treason" which is accused of justice, according to the putschist government.
Putschist President Roberto Micheletti succeeded in organizing a presidential election on November 29 to replace Mr. Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was elected during the controversial election recognized by the United States but challenged by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, the Congress voted massively against Mr. Zelaya's return to power until the end of his term of office on 27 January.
Wall Street mounts, the U.S. trade balance feeds optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended up on Thursday, the US trade balance figures showing the resumption of the activity of both the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones won 0.67% and the Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average moved from 68.78 points to 10,405,83 points, and Nasdaq, technologically dominant, from 7,13 points to 2,190.06 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index was awarded 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1.102.35 points.
There is good news coming from different parts of the economy, Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial said.
But this remains anecdotal, has it temperated, considering that the market focused on "the glass half full".
For Peter Cardillo, from Avalon Partners, investors focused mainly on the American trade balance figures, "which show that the activity is improving in the fourth quarter."
The US trade deficit decreased by 7.6% in October compared with September, to $32.9 billion.
Analysts expected the opposite of a deficit gap.
As many imports as exports have increased.
The big news is the growth of trade volumes, especially for goods exports, which reflects the growth of the economies of the major trading partners in the United States, Christopher Cornell, of the Economy.com research firm, commented.
On the other hand, new unemployment registrations in the United States increased against expectations last week to reach 474,000 applications.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers "has fallen to the lowest for a year," said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The return of the Treasury Bond at the age of 10 increased to 3.482% compared to 3.423% Tuesday evening and the return to the age of 30 to 4.492% compared to 4.408% on the day before.
Cuba: Hundreds of power supporters make up the "White Ladies" · Global Voices
A few hundred Cuban government supporters made up on Thursday wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for the World Day of Human Rights, and prevented another demonstration for which about ten dissidents were interrogated.
Some 40 "White Ladies", married or close to political prisoners, were streetbound by Raul Castro government supporters as they marched to the capital center to claim the release of political prisoners, a PFA journalist observed.
Down the Yankees!, "mercenaries!", "the street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Live Fidel and Raul!" scandalized, the raised fist, the supporters of power to dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilian agents who came to "ensure their protection".
On the previous day, a similar demonstration took place against the "White Ladies" in Havana, without injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana district of Vedado, about ten dissidents who were also preparing to protest on Thursday for the International Human Rights Day were interviewed by civilian police officers, and a PFA journalist observed.
The police have forced the dissidents who were made up by government supporters in civilian vehicles, according to this journalist.
Inquiries of dissidents in similar circumstances generally last only a few hours.
Recipients of the 2005 Sakharov Prize of the European Parliament, the "White Ladies" had organized an unauthorized march to "demand the release of all political prisoners", 200 according to dissent, declared one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Hector Maceda is serving a 20-year term in prison.
Mr. Maceda was part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of whom remained under locks.
Cuban authorities regard opponents as "mercenaries" or "agents" on the balance of their declared enemy, the United States.
In fact, Cuban television reported on Thursday's demonstration of pro-government activists against "counter-revolutionaries".
Cuba, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of violating rights and freedoms, including expression.
A forced man kills an octogenary by knife and makes 5 wounded in Clichy-la-Garenne
An armed force with two knives killed one octogenary and wounded five others in the city centre of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine), at an hour of influx, Thursday at the end of the day.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the aggressor, aged 28, would have been struck with two knives and for indeterminate reasons, an octogenary, in or in front of a pharmacy of 85 Boulevard Jean-Jaures, was learned from police sources and from witnesses.
Seriously injured, the old man, born in 1929 according to an officer of the Alliance Police Union, died in the hospital of the follow-up to his injuries.
In or in front of the same pharmacy, he then took it to a couple whose wife was pregnant.
The husband, who was about thirty years old, stood up and was injured.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were admitted to the hospital where the octogeneary broke down.
The days of the other injured are in danger, with vital organs apparently affected, according to police sources.
The pregnant woman then had a malaise and was reportedly hospitalized "in a state of shock", according to a police source.
The armed man, who seemed under the grip of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would then have fled into the street, always boulevard Jean Jaurès.
He would have hurt two passingers, apparently at random: a thirty-year-old and a quadrant, the latter severely.
The scenario was confused in the evening.
He was armed with two butcher knives that he wore in the cross behind his back, explained on the spot a head of the Alliance union in the Hautes-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passers-bys, including young people, according to evidence collected by the PSA, tried to master the force.
I saw a guy in his 30s with a green jacket.
Three young people tried to intercept him.
They didn't get there because the guy was stubborn, said Alberto, the server of a nearby bar.
A crowd fell on him, including a municipal police officer who broke his wrist, he added.
Also Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at the height of n°61, two municipal police officers, including their officer, tried to intercept the armed man and were injured by fists, according to police sources.
The facts occurred in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are many shops.
Passers came to tell me there was an injured person outside.
I went out, saw a 70-year-old person on the ground, put him in a safe position, and noticed a very important wound in the abdomen, told AFP Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, a second person came in about thirty years, wounded by knives.
It was national police officers who arrested the man without identity papers.
The Nanterre Prosecutor's Office for Judicial Police of the Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92) was seized of the investigation.
The Force was hospitalized Thursday night.
He had not yet been heard in his custody.
A police source did not exclude him from being admitted to a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, it took six police officers to control him at the police station in Clichy where he was taken.
He was "in a state of overexcitement" as "all the forces of this species whose forces are decoupled under the effect of the action".
USA: Polanski's lawyer again calls for the cessation of prosecutions
The lawyer of the French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski once again claimed Thursday in Los Angeles (California, west of the United States), the abandonment of prosecution against his client, currently assigned to residence in Switzerland for a matter of more than 30 years.
Chad Hummel, the lawyer of the director of the "Pianist", denounced before three judges of the Court of Appeal of the Second District of California of serious procedural errors at the time of the facts in 1977.
I demand the abandonment of charges here and now, said Mr. Hummel, before adding that the conduct of the court in charge of the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, was "cold in the back".
According to him, Judge Rittenband -- who died since -- would have discussed, before giving his sentence, with a prosecutor who would have told him that Roman Polanski deserved the prison -- which is a serious procedural fault.
This discussion had been revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, sought and desired), from the prosecutor's own mouth, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells had finally declared at the end of September to have "lies" to the documentary author.
In the event that the court refused to give up the prosecution, Mr. Hummel demanded that a trial be held, which would allow him to present the evidence of his argument.
The accusation reiterated the argument already developed in the first instance, namely that no discharge of charges could be seriously considered until Roman Polanski would appear before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978, before his sentence was pronounced, for "unlawful sexual relations" with a 13-year-old minor.
He's never given his feet back to the United States since.
Deputy Attorney of Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, said that Roman Polanski "must be here to present himself at the hearing."
In this case, we want to send the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, that it is possible to flee?, asked Asayama.
For her, the filmmaker "demands a favor to the court, while disregarding her authority".
One of the three judges -- who now have 90 days to make their decision -- also pointed out "that there were other alternatives to escape."
Mr. Hummel was not alone in calling for the cessation of prosecution against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer's lawyer, the victim, also claimed, once again, the end of the prosecution.
Recalling that her client no longer supports being harassed at every rebound in the Polanski case, she added: "No one in this room can say that the procedure has been fair.
Thirty-two years, that's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland on U.S. arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was assigned to residence in his Gstaad chalet, awaiting possible extradition.
Wall Street ends without direction, braked by the increase of the dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended off on Friday, in a market split between better indicators than expected in the United States and the dollar increase: the Dow Jones won 0.63% but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased from 65.67 points to 10.471.5 points, while the Nasdaq, technologically dominant, dropped 0.55 points to 2.190.31 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index increased from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very calm, Mace Blicksilver from Marblehead Asset Management noted.
It remains in narrow margins, the volume of trade has become very low and I think that will remain the case until the end of the year.
The trend was supported by the publication of better than expected economic indicators, which "helped to improve the market's view of the robustness of economic recovery", summarized the analysts of Charles Schwab.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November for the second month of sharp and much more than expected.
In addition, consumer confidence in the United States increased significantly in December to 73.4 compared with 67.4 the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index.
However, the indices have been halted by a further increase in the dollar, up from two months before the euro, which "brings down the sectors sensitive to the economic situation," explained Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
Technological values have thus lost ground.
The bond market has fallen.
The return of the Treasury Bond at the age of 10 increased to 3,540% compared to 3,482% on Wednesday evening and the return to the age of 30 to 4,497% compared to 4,492% on the day before.
The election of Miss Monde once again in South Africa
After a month of periple across South Africa, the 112 Miss Monde candidates are preparing to cross the last straight line on Saturday to realize their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion viewers.
At this great mass of beauty organized for the second consecutive year in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already picked up their ticket for the semifinal.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta of Mexico, Mariatu Ka rgbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were elected Miss sports or Miss top model during their African stay.
It was a real whirlwind.
Visiting beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town was extraordinary.
I've seen so many things and I've had so many experiences!
This competition, which takes place for the ninth time in South Africa, is broadcast live Saturday from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, from 5 p.m. (15h00 GMT).
I couldn't dream of a better country to give my crown back.
This experience was fascinating.
I am happy to have lived it twice, says Miss Monde Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian, his second stay in South Africa was marked by many exchanges with the candidates and the rediscovery of "the landscapes to cut the breath in this country".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, press meetings and safari, the Misses are now focusing on the competition.
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow the steps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000 and present at this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both became Bollywood stars.
It is the dream of every woman to be crowned the most beautiful of the world, but it is not just about appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our country and I want to go home with the crown, throw Miss India with a broad smile.
According to organizers, music and dance will score this 59th edition.
The candidates will parade in traditional costume and of course in swimwear.
The show will be animated by a TV presenter, the Chinese Angela Chow, the former queen of South African beauty Michelle McLean and a leader of the Miss Monde Steve Douglas committee.
South Africa has shown that it knows how to welcome the world with warmth and pride that it is difficult to equal, says Julia Morley, President of Miss Monde.
The candidates have as last year made a safari, visited the famous Township of Soweto, but this time by bike, and tasted local cuisine.
Exceptionally, they also met South African President Jacob Zuma, who held their hand.
Not common for a head of state, Miss Sierra Leone.
Their most beautiful memory will probably remain the draw at the Cape (southwest) for the June 2010 World Cup, a way for the country to further promote the event.
I've been around people I never thought I could approach.
I'm definitely going back to the 2010 World Cup, Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
Johnny Hallyday's news "are very positive," according to his son David
Johnny Hallyday's news "are very positive," assured his son David on Friday on his arrival at Los Angeles airport where he had to go to the hair of his hospitalized father for several days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, it's going very well, told the press David Hallyday at his departure from the plane that brought him from Paris shortly after 13h00 locals (21h00 GMT).
The singer's son, the relaxed air, assured him that he was going to go "very quickly" to the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted Monday for a follow-up infection to the operation of a discal hernia on November 26 in Paris.
The singer was "placed in an artificial coma this night in Los Angeles for a reason of comfort, to prevent him from suffering and to be able to administer his treatment," said the press service.
Johnny Hallyday had already been placed in an artificial coma by doctors at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where he had been admitted Monday for an infection following the operation of a discal hernia on November 26 in Paris.
The singer had to be re-operated on the night of Wednesday to Thursday due to significant injuries resulting from this intervention.
His wife Laeticia went to Los Angeles's French high school on Friday morning, where their daughter Jade was educated to attend a school show, she noticed a photographer of the AFP.
The head of orthopaedic and traumatological surgery at the Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer on Monday in Los Angeles.
The producer violently questioned Dr Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated the singer at the Monceau Park International Clinic in Paris on November 26.
We were told it was a massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were out, said Mr. Camus.
I heard about a possible future judicial procedure, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus said Johnny Hallyday was "to leave too soon for Los Angeles, with the permission of the Parisian surgeon."
I had this doctor in person online who assured me that there was no problem for this trip and it amazed me, since I had myself two discal hernies, did he add.
Earlier on RTL, he had indicated that the singer was apparently "going without a drain, without anything", after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the art community.
He had operated actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before her death, at a Neuilly-sur-Seine clinic where he was operating at the time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsburg to resorb a haematoma as a result of a brain hemorrhage.
But he is also a doctor of the sulfurous reputation, condemned several times by justice, in medically responsible cases, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, the lawyer of the order of the Doctors, accused him of being "a man without scruples" prosecuted "regularly" before the Council of Order, and which is "far from being recommended".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke on Friday through his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
He indicated that the intervention had been "perfectly well carried out" and that the post-operative examinations were "normal".
The operation "was not haemorrhagic and therefore did not require the laying of a drain," he added.
In any event, the singer's tour, whose health problems have increased since this summer, seems to be in parentheses.
Obviously, a resumption of the tour on January 8 (in Amiens, ndlr) as planned, it seems very short, said Mr. Camus.
The UDF association increases the tone and sum the New Centre no longer uses its seal
The UDF association, controlled by the MoDem of François Bayrou, reacted on Friday to the attempt of OPA by the President of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, on the seal of the former Giscardian party, by maintaining it no longer to use it on any media, subject to prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the UDF seal, judging that François Bayrou did not deserve to defend his political heritage after having stretched his hand to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party is a partner of the UMP, also planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the NC National Council.
To support his approach, he received support from Hervé de Charette (formerly NC MP) who claimed ownership of the UDF brand for having deposited it with the National Institute of Industrial Property in 2004.
But on Friday evening, the UDF association's office, controlled by François Bayrou's friends who don't want to be dispossed, left his silence to launch a stay to the Minister and to the MP, sum them up from using the seal and transmitting the ownership of the mark, subject to prosecution.
You have multiplied, in recent days, statements indicating that you are going to propose to your political movement to +reprise+ the UDF seal, writes the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez du MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Arthuis of the Centralist Alliance.
You also thought it good to follow on your militant material and on the page of your website, the name of this movement, the +New Center+, today's slogan +UDF+, also notes the mail signatories.
As you don't know, you have no right to use this symbol, explains the UDF office that still requires the NC to "immediately remove the name of the UDF from any medium as well as (sound) website."
He also asks Hervé de Charette "to transmit the ownership of (la) trademarks to its legitimate rights".
If you did not do so, the courts would be seized to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories are advised.
In their mail, they state that the UDF "has been a full political movement since 1978" and recall that Mr. Morin and his friends had "made the choice" to leave it in 2007 "to create a competitive movement, as others had done in 2002, to create the UMP".
The New Centre therefore has no right, in their view, to use the UDF (Union for French Democracy).
They also recall that the last UDF Congress voted in 2007 for its membership in MoDem for three years and the creation of an office to defend the "material and moral interests" of Valéry Giscard d'Estaing's training.
As for Hervé de Charette, he continued the office, "when he filed the brand", he was not "more UDF-adherent for three years", but at the UMP.
It exploits scandalously and fraudulently the absence of deposit of the UDF acronym to perform it on its own.
This delicacy is becoming a crime, they denounce, before they are ironicized on the NC strategy: "It seems to us that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make a name of itself than to try to get out of the anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which we are not entitled."
Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier will be judged for abuse of weakness
The Nanterre court decided on Friday to judge the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether, as accused by the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt, he took advantage of a state of weakness of the octogenary to escort her from part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his photos of stars, will be tried on April 15 and 16, 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime punishable by a maximum of three years' imprisonment and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will be a trial in this case worthy of a saga on one of France's richest families, in which mother and daughter are torn apart while holding the realms of the empire of cosmetics L'Oréal.
But the 15th Correctional Chamber also ordered that Liliane Bettencourt's medical expertise, aged 87, should be carried out collectively by three doctors.
The heir and principal shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to submit to such an examination, in any case not under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Prosecutor's Office during the investigation.
The doctors designated on Friday will have to submit a report by 10 March 2010 saying, in particular, whether Liliane Bettencourt has been in a state of weakness and at what times.
I think she'll submit to it.
I'll talk to him about it, said Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyer, Mr. Georges Kiejman at the hearing.
For his part, the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, welcomed the court's decision.
This is an excellent news (...) The expertise will demonstrate that he (Mr. Banier) manipulated this elderly lady that we must protect, he said.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt's unique daughter has been prosecuting the criminal against François-Marie Banier, photographer and artist, who has been accusing her of taking advantage of her mother's weakness for years to obtain one billion euros of gifts, in the form of cheques, life insurance contracts or master's tables.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt has always refused to have been manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers to be a long-standing friend.
While the court had to examine the admissibility of the action undertaken by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, lawyers' pleadings sometimes turned to the great family debate on Friday.
For example, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer mentioned three letters sent by her client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary, in which she said she looked after Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In the letter dated 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer, "could you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for fifteen years.
Françoise, I've never been able to talk to him since his wedding."
For its part, the Nanterre Prosecutor's Office once again considered that the complainant was not eligible to act, especially since a guardian's judge has refused in recent days to apply for a judicial protection procedure for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full ability to act in justice, she is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one else has to act in his place," said the representative of the public ministry, Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
The court finally decided that it would decide once the trial took place on the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers.
The management revolution or the end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of the great French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence will have been futile...
For more than ten years, the attitude of the management of large companies vis-à-vis their employees, recalls the position of the companies vis-à-vis consumers before the marketing revolution: it is about getting employees to adhere to "values" determined from above as it once was, to impose on consumers products thought of by factory technicians.
By putting the customer at the heart of the company, the marketing revolution has handed over market conquest strategies to the place... although the authoritarian temptation to impose disconnected products from customer preferences factors comes back regularly!
Demobilization of employees can lead to deadly demoralization.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the emerging part of a much more general phenomenon that affects particularly managers.
This demobilization seriously undermines the development of all intellectual functions of the company, including R&D and, more importantly, economic intelligence.
Indeed, the EI "requires all stakeholders (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking vision"; it requires a commitment on the part of employees that authoritarian management revenues are totally contrary.
That is why we call for a managerial revolution that would involve placing employees at the centre of the company's concerns in the same way as the client.
The relative usefulness of internal opinion investigations
Are internal opinion surveys – like the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its employees – going to stimulate this revolution in management practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
- First of all because I was able to see that, in the face of a new situation, every structure finally comes, after many deviations, to do priority... what it has always done.!
- Then, because of authoritarianism – one of the diseases of power – grows proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most leaders have a simplistic view of human behavior.
In large engineering schools, they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, by intellectual comfort, the old behaviorist theory, recently reactivated by the U.S. "nerosciences" and widely disseminated, in their own right, by the institutes of studies and the media.
Thus, by suggesting that it is possible to handle the "leaves" of the engagement of executives, a recent investigation of Ipsos published in Le Figaro.fr comforts leaders in a position of mechanistic governance, inadequate to today's world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors
On the contrary, the management revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern companies requires adopting a finalist view of human behaviour.
It consists of integrating, in any reason or practice of governance, a fundamental finding: for employees, commitment to the company is only possible if it clearly appears as a means of realizing some of their dreams, ambitions, and projects.
Currently, only studies from the Reasonary Analysis adopt this concept of employees' motivations.
These studies have shown that they judge their business on the basis of a predetermined doxa that allows them, through their perceived image of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to carry out their life plans.
Through the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, business leaders can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and return their human resources management "to the place".
They thus create a field conducive to the concerted development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
Speech from Oslo: "Just War" is worth praise to Obama on the right
The U.S. right welcomed the speech delivered on Friday to Oslo by Barack Obama, pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who had broached the award of the prize to Mr. Obama on 9 October, applauded this time the presidential speech, like Sarah Palin, who was a former vice-president at the 2008 elections.
I liked what he said, said Mrs. Palin, the right wing of the Republican party, to the daily USA Today, adding that she had addressed the theme of the war "sometimes necessary" in her newly published memoirs.
The war is of course the last thing I think Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
These terrorists must be arrested all over there, she thought.
Obama, who inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, worked Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Mr. Obama, Newt Gingrich, felt that the president had done in Oslo "very good work".
I found that the speech was really good, congratulated the former president of the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential statement.
On some sides, I found this historic speech, said Mr. Gingrich, interrogated during the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former election, considered by some as a possible candidate for the Republican Investment for the 2012 presidential election, was delighted to see "a left-wing president" reminding members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free and could not give a peace price if the use of force did not exist".
For Michael Gerson, a former lead by George W. Bush reconverted chronicler at the Washington Post, Mr. Obama made "a very American speech".
In addition to presenting himself as a "citizens of the world" as "he always does", "he spoke as an American president", reminding Europeans "that they live in a security bubble that they have not created and that they do not do much to preserve it," said Mr Gerson.
Among the few on the right not to be convinced, a hawk of the Bush era, the former ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton, called the speech "land, bottled and uninspired" on the National Review Online site.
On the left hand side of the president, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justify the use of force.
When war is wrapped in the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the massacre of innocent people, he warned.
However, the left-wing press remained commendable for the president.
The Los Angeles Times, while still thinking that the Nobel was awarded early to Mr. Obama, called his speech "overproduction" even for a speaker known for his talent.
Oslo's speech "should be used as a road map to guide international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression," the California daily was on fire.
Obama "spoke the necessary speech," said the New York Times, judging him as "both dark and upbuilding".
Routes: Three marathons for an agreement that saves Christmas supplies
After three Marathon negotiations, the trade unions in the road sector and TLF, the only employers' organization to have remained until the end, reached an agreement Friday evening that ended the strike call and the threat to Christmas supplies.
At the signing session on Friday evening, the Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, was "rejoicing" of this agreement, after several negotiating sessions, started Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, the negotiators left in the early morning, hoping to sign the text of agreement quickly at the end of the morning.
And this even though three employers' organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTR) had knocked on the door.
But it took more than six hours of a meeting that started at 11 a.m. so that everyone agreed and that at 6 p.m. the text was signed.
The conflict "would have been very detrimental to businesses" and "it was to be feared that he would come to disrupt the weekend parties," said Mr. Bussereau.
The text provides for an increase in wages by 4 per cent for lower wages (in local and regional road transport), and 2.9% for higher wages (international transport).
At hourly rates, for wages, "from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros.
It's not much, but we start from far away, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
Either we're going to order our militants that there are no blockades, no blockades of the refuelling centres.
But we can always have some recalcitrants who are not happy, did he add.
Philippe Grillot, President of TLF, welcomed "a good deal", even though it was "hard to grant increases on high wages in the light of international competition".
According to him, the increases will be around 170 euros per month for low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
This is the agreement of common sense and respect for employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) praised "a historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) referred to him as an "acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for the re-evaluation of travel costs of 3%, and the general status of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will enable, inter alia, to address the question of a 13th month and a modernisation of the collective agreement.
Mr Bussereau recalled that a "decrease of EUR 100 million in employer charges" had been the subject of a government amendment to the draft amending finance bill for 2009, voted on Thursday night to Friday by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate to vote "in the same way."
The signing of the TLF allows the agreement to apply initially to companies that are members of this organization, and in second time to the whole profession, in case of extension by the Minister of Labour.
She will become "faster," said Mr. Bussereau.
The opposition of employers' organizations can only delay the process.
The FNTR has denounced a "dupes market", as the EUR 100 million "had already been promised to the sector to offset part of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport has forced us to negotiate in the emergency, not in conclusion of a shared analysis, but not to oppose the turkey eaters of the next awakening, deplored Unostra.
For the other, the agreement is likely "to dig up the grave of a very large number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months".
RER A: disturbances this weekend, unhappy unions of RATP proposals
The disturbances on RER A, France's largest urban common transport line, will continue during the weekend, while a meeting on Friday on the 2nd day of strike between trade unions and RATP management left them on their hunger for their premium demand.
Saturday and Sunday, for this important weekend of pre-Christmas purchases, there will be trains only between 10:00 and 20:00, due to a train every two on the central section (between the Defence and the Nation) and a train every four outside the central section.
Interconnection with SNCF will be suspended at Nanterre Prefecture, which will force travellers to change train.
The Galleries Lafayette, which waits for 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "RATP makes efforts to serve large stores".
The RER Across the West is the Parisian agglomeration.
The RATP section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one train in two drove at peak hours, and almost no copper in deep hours, as planned.
As on Thursday, there was no cohue on the docks, the French had organized themselves.
Thus in the early morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less frequent than usual, especially due to the absence of colleagues and high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Leger (Val-de-Marne), a 29-year-old engineer, Jack Nbakina explained whether he had risen "one hour thirty earlier, to be sure to arrive by the time".
The Saint-Lazare Station had no saturation, the SNCF indicated, which had provided for the management of law enforcement officers and forces.
The RERs operated by SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from Saint-Lazare station to reach the metros.
New general assembly of strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, which will examine the results, judged "big" by the unions, of a meeting with management Friday afternoon.
The Director of RRSP proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for RRSP A on all aspects, working time, career development, etc.
That is not what drivers want, which demand a premium due, according to Thierry Garon (South).
RATP even put its parentheses premium proposals, outraged the CGT, stressing that management "was unable to solve a problem while in the roads and SNCF it is done".
A new meeting is scheduled for Monday for "a broader review of the conditions for the exercise of the profession," said RATP.
This also led trade unions to say that the company "has been mocking users of the weekend".
In the morning, some 150 drivers had invaded an establishment committee at headquarters in Paris.
It was then that the management, who so far refused any discussion during the strike, had suggested the meeting "in order to calm down".
The conflict threatens to expand to RRSP B Tuesday, following the filing of a notice by Unsa and Independents.
Trade unions request a premium of EUR 120 (Unsa) to EUR 150, of which EUR 30 variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independent) and complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this line to millions of travellers daily.
RER drivers, all in the second part of a career, are 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross as well as 600 to 650 euros premiums, for off-the-shelf hours, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice dissolves the pro-Kurde party, heavy decision of consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court declared on Friday the dissolution of the country's main pro-Kurdian party, a decision that was immediately followed by manifestations of anger in the Kurdish community, in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision may greatly complicate the government's task, which has just helped the Kurdish community to try to end 25 years of conflict.
The Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) has been dissolved because it has become a "foyer of activities detrimental to the independence of the State and its indivisible unity", said the President of the Hasim Kiliz Court to the press after four days of deliberations.
The decision was taken unanimously by the 11 judges, while a qualified seven-voting majority was required to declare the dissolution, said Mr.Kiliç, adding that 37 of the party's executives, including President Ahmet Türk and MP Aysel Tugluk, were excluded from political life for five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of parliamentary immunity from Mr. Türk and Ms. Tugluk and the confiscation by the party's Treasury of property.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
His leaders had warned before the verdict that Members would leave Parliament rather than sit as parliamentarians without a label.
The decision follows a procedure initiated in 2007 by the Prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accuses the DTP of obeying the "directives" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered to be a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political window of the PKK rebels.
The party ensures, however, that it has "no organic link" with the PKK but refuses to qualify it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The Court's verdict intervenes as the government has just held hands on the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures strengthening its rights, to try to extend the support of the Kurds to the PKK and put an end to the conflict.
DTP leaders had stated that dissolution could lead to a rise in tensions in South-East Anatolian, where many demonstrations against the detention conditions of PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan have degenerated into clashes with the police in recent weeks.
As of the announcement of justice, a thousand protesters gathered in front of the DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the largest city in the south-east populated by the majority of Kurds.
Order forces fired tear grenades and used water cannons, while demonstrators threw molotov cocktails or stones, with cleavage.
About 100 people also showed up in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr.Türk stated that the Justice decision would "deepen despair".
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (Kurde, ndlr) by banning a party, he told the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamic movement, also deplored the decision.
We are in principle opposed to the closure of the parties.
This is not solving anything, said the Minister of Energy Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a total torpedoes of the democratic openness launched by the government, commented political analyst Ahmet Insel.
Of course, one can expect a PKK reaction, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed an attack that had killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the most deadly in recent months.
The first snows can fall
What Wolfgang Brauburger wants is a very rigorous winter.
But the person responsible for the road cutoff and sanding service (EFS) clearly states that it is not to upset citizens.
It is simply so that agents can test the technique of vehicles and learn to master them properly.
And according to meteorologists, this might well be for this weekend.
More than 300 agents and 120 vehicles are ready to tackle the snow and the ice.
The EDF is following a very elaborate plan here.
Mr. Brauburger explained that as soon as it snows over the city of Frankfurt and temperatures fall below zero, large sanding vehicles travel 20 main routes (called itineraries A) .
This includes large-circuit streets, major arteries, such as the Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
Firefighters, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and steep streets such as Atzelbergstraße are also included.
FS officers begin their service at three in the morning.
If necessary, the 1040 kilometres of road must be salted with a good road foundation, within 3 hours of maximum time.
That's why the EDF service starts at 3:00 in the morning "so that the roads are cleared when daily migration begins."
That's when the snow falls at 7:30 in the morning.
This poses problems, tells us the manager of the road breakage and sanding service "because no car driver is willing to let the salting vehicles pass".
Then, if it no longer snows, we deal with access roads and desert roads - such as the Rat-Beil-Straße.
Secondary roads and side streets come last.
Mr. Brauburger is well aware that this still causes some complaints.
At five o'clock in the morning, the EDF's pedestrian team is on its way to prioritize areas considered dangerous and crossings.
As for cycle tracks, EDF services cannot generally deal with them.
Mr. Brauburger said that there was a special service in Frankfurt to monitor the state of the bridges between 22 and 4.30 hours.
As the glass forms very quickly on these surfaces, the salting vehicles intervene as soon as the temperature drops below 2 degrees.
The police may also use this special service in case of need.
They gave him dinosaurs.
The Tawa Hallae resembled other carnivorous dinosaurs: this bipede was about 2 meters long for 1.50m high, its posterior limbs were powerful, its long skull was filled with sharp and curving teeth, its short arms ended up with scarf claws and it had a long tail.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it would have had nothing exceptional.
But, as Sertling Nesbitt reports from the University of Texas in Austin and his colleagues in Thursday's Science magazine, the Tawa Hallae is one of the first dinosaurs with these morphological characteristics.
This animal lived 215 million years ago in New Mexico, which was then part of the lands emerging from the supercontinent, the Pangea and was in the equator.
Sertling Nesbitt said that the discovery of the Tawa sheds light on the evolution of the first dinosaurs in a new day.
Indeed, it informs us about the kinship links, the distribution and the characteristics of the latter.
It was in 2006 that Sertling Nesbitt began searching with other paleontologists on the Gohst Ranch site in northern New Mexico.
Randall Irmis of the Utah Natural History Museum and a member of the search team tells them that they sometimes found a dozen bones in one day which is absolutely unique for a sedimentary layer dating from the Trias.
Scientists quickly realized that some of these bones belonged to a new species.
The searches updated the remains of five specimens.
A discovery that confirms the theories regarding the beginnings of the evolution of dinosaurs.
Researchers named it Tawa according to the word of the Many Indians for the god of the sun.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is an exceptional discovery: dinosaur fossils from Trias are extremely rare and are limited to some incomplete bone fragments.
Not all paleontology experts share this enthusiasm.
For example, Martin Sander of the University of Bonn does not find this discovery to be particularly spectacular, but it specifies that it allows to confirm certain theories regarding the beginnings of the evolution of dinosaurs.
According to the current state of knowledge, dinosaurs appeared on Earth approximately 230 million years ago.
Most older fossils, however, are fragmented and incomplete, making classification of all the first dinosaurs very difficult.
Experts wonder, among other things, at what time the sauriens were divided into three major evolution groups: the theropods (carnivores) which include the tyrannosaur and the velociraptor that appeared later and which descended the birds, the sauropods, the quadrupeds along the neck, and the herbivores ornithischia, which are part of the species such as triceratops and stegosaurus.
According to studies by S. Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa is one of the first theropods.
This species presents an interesting report of both primitive and developed characteristics, says S. Nesbitt.
Researchers found indications that the Tawa Hallae had small air bags in its skull-level bones, as well as birds that are the offspring of the the theropods.
These small air pockets facilitate the breathing of birds compared to mammals.
It seems that in the Tawa Hallae, the vertebrae were also partially filled with air.
According to Randall Irmis, Tawa is one of the oldest theropods with small air bags in its bones.
Since the apparent line of the vast sauropods also had air bags and a light body, it can be thought that their common ancestor already had this beneficial innovation.
Three successive waves of migration to North America.
Since the most primitive dinosaurs known lived in South America, researchers concluded that the saurians appeared there.
Therefore, the three major lines of evolution have divided and spread from South America to the rest of the world, i.e. all the emerging lands that formed the Pangée supercontinent.
This seems to be confirmed by the fact that the Paleontologist team has also discovered the remains of two other theropods that are not particularly related to it.
The three species cannot descend from a common ancestor who would have migrated, advancing researchers.
Alan Turner of the Museum of Natural History in New York and co-author of the magazine Science Studies said there would have been at least three waves of migration to North America.
Of course there are some contradictions.
Martin Sander, Paleontologist in Bonn, says there is an even older species, the silesaure, living in present Poland and belonging to a group related to dinosaurs.
In his view, this could give an incorrect view because in South America there are a large number of dinosaur fossils that have been preserved while virtually none of them are found on other continents.
On the other hand, how did dinosaurs succeed in becoming the dominant tetrapods of the secondary age while they came from a relatively rare collateral line of the reptile branch, still remains a mystery today.
At the time of the Trias, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as with the ancestors of the current crocodiles and many other Syrians.
By the end of the Trias the dinosaurs spread across the planet, thus favoring the development of many new species, while others, who were related to them, disappeared between the Trias and the Jurassic.
However, such success is not eternal.
To explain this transformation, Martin Sander sees two assumptions.
There could have been a massive extinction to which dinosaurs survived randomly while other reptiles would have disappeared.
Or so, dinosaurs were better suited and they were thus able to eliminate competition on the ground.
In any case, such a success is not eternal.
150 million years later, the fall of a meteorite favoring the development of a group of animals that had also developed during the Trias and which had since been vegetated in the shadows: these were mammals.
The solidarity of Vienna in Sao Paulo
The list is long and there are signatories from all over the world.
There are professors from the University of Toronto, Cambridge University, Vienna University or Berkeley University in California.
There are those in charge of courses at the University of Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin and Bremen.
The J.W. Goethe University of Frankfurt's casino police evacuation takes place worldwide.
278 professors and teachers at J.W. Goethe University as well as other higher education institutions in Germany, Europe and North and South America express their solidarity with the protesting students of the Campus Westend.
In a statement written in German and English they condemn the intervention of the police claimed by the University Steering Committee.
Last week, the President of Werner Müller-Estler University had evacuated the buildings occupied by students and teachers on strike after walls and works of art had been barred from graffiti.
Five students were injured during the evacuation.
Signatories believe that the degradation did not justify "such a violent intervention by the police commando against students and teachers who had organized their own courses".
Evacuation is an "unacceptable achievement" of freedom of research and education.
Focusing exclusively on acts of vandalism serves only to "delegitimize and criminalize protest" and tries to forget the reasons for mobilization.
The University's Steering Committee has thus avoided discussions that would be essential.
Court officials require that criminal prosecutions be suspended immediately.
The majority of the occupants did not participate in the degradation.
Legitimization of protests
The youth of the Green Trade Union in the Services Sector and the German Confederation of Trade Unions (DGS) are supportive of the students.
Protests are only the legitimate expression of growing concern for our own future, says Alexander Klein, Regional Secretary for Youth of the Verdi Union.
As for the Minister of Sciences of the Land of Hesse Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), it took action and cause for the action undertaken by the President of the University and the police.
We thank the President of the University.
Any occupation and degradation of the premises is totally unacceptable, she told the Regional Parliament of Wiesbaden last Thursday during the current television show Stunde.
We understand the meaning of protests but do not accept vandalism, said the CDU Member of the regional Parliament Peter Beuth.
The parliamentary groups of the SPD opposition, the Greens and the Left (Die Linke) did not share this view.
The CSU takes the pretext of some painted walls to criminalize protests, said Janine Wissler of the La Gauche party (Linke)
Instead of thinking about the students' arguments and claims, they are evacuated.
The La Gauche Party tabled a motion that sums up the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on the conditions of police intervention.
The new Silicon-valley
For a long time she had been known as a secret city, forbidden to Western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was under the Soviet regime a secret weapon search site under strict surveillance.
Today with its 216,000 inhabitants 37 km from central Moscow, the municipality has the reputation of being the Soviet Silicon Valley.
Important micro- and nanoelectronic production and research sites are located there.
As of September 2008, representatives of Zelenograd have established links with Riedberg, the location of the Frankfurt science community – with university institutes and companies at the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were reciprocal meetings, and last Wednesday representatives of Zelenograd and Riedberg ratified a "Protocol of Close Cooperation".
The signatories were the deputy mayor of Moscow Juri Rosljak and the prefect Anatoly Smimov of Zelenograd for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz Head of Project Section for Frankfurt.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and SMEs, whose strength is scientific research, will leave for a seminar in Zelenograd.
Scientific exchange
This is a sustainable scientific exchange.
But also economic relations.
It will allow FIZ companies to enter the expanding Russian market.
Conversely, Russian scientific companies want contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat of famous Soviet institutes and research companies.
The Institute of Electronics in Moscow, the major Sytronic companies and Rosssijskaja-Elektronika are located there.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a "planned socialist city" for weapons research.
Zelenograd (literally translated "Green City") draws its name from the wooded hills in the heart of which the research centres are located.
Project S21: a brake for Stuttgart
The scale of the Stuttgart 21 project cannot be sufficiently high.
For his supporters it is nothing less than "new heart of Europe".
S21, it is much more than the landfill of a railway station, more than a colossal construction project that will plunge the heart of the capital of Bade-Wurtemberg, into a desperate chaos of constructions for some ten years.
Stuttgart 21 was born from the mind of the 1980s.
The railway stations, with roads ending in the middle of town, had the reputation at the time of being the relics of the 19th century transport technique that made the effect of modern rail traffic brake sabotage because it took a long time to move locomotives from the back to the front.
Arrival, short stop, departure – that's what we need to do.
That's why the linehead stations must disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart also: a train station, which is halfway between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava, from where the slogan "heart of Europe" is located.
The implementation of the S21 project will really begin, although the visions of the 1980s have long been not compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious planners recognized that the cost, to bury the station in the respective capitals of Hesse and Bavaria, was exorbitant.
In fact, the linehead stations no longer really pose entry and exit problems since there are modern trains, reversible with autorails and pilot car at both ends.
However, we are now launching the realization of Stuttgart 21 next to the new trace of the inter-city line towards Ulm.
Regional and community policies have taken it.
The railway company is the party because it is the taxpayer who makes the risk costs of the largest infrastructure project in the federal Republic and not the public enterprise.
From an urban point of view, this project is relatively well justified.
We get an urban space that – if you believe the graphics of computer-generated planners – will be very green.
For the rail transport system, the S21 is harmful.
The crossing station and the extension of the section are designed for a traffic of persons to whom - and it is typical of the 1980s - a huge growth.
At that time, there was still no competition for cheap flights.
Modern traffic policy should first focus on strengthening the traffic of goods because rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than by truck on the road.
But the new track, with its inclinations, does not fit the freight trains.
The S21, and this is much more serious indirectly concerns many other rail projects.
For example, EUR 6 billion will be incorporated into the Soubabe project.
That's the official figure.
Experts believe that ten to fifteen billion are more realistic.
One thing is certain, in the next decade this money will be missing for other points of connection and anchorage in the network.
A total of sixty major projects are listed in the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the expansion of the section across the Rhine Valley of 180 good kilometers.
Since 1987 this line has been built slowly.
It would be very urgent to fully support the fungus here.
But project S21 has the effect of a braking saboteur.
The route of the Rhine Valley is on the way to becoming the bottleneck of international freight traffic, which is at the heart of Europe.
The Government examines the judgment of the airport
In the Wiesbaden Regional Parliament, the Government of the Land referred to the possibility of appeal to the Hesse Administrative Tribunal for the Prohibition of Air Flight at Night.
The Minister of Economics Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the CDU/FDP coalition had entrusted experts with the legal review of the judgement of the Administrative Tribunal, which is a document containing more than 400 pages.
The Kassel Tribunal had justified in a written document that the Land should adapt the regulation concerning the prohibition of night flights in the case or the proposed construction of the northwest runway at Frankfurt airport.
The authorization to enter 17 aircraft between 23am and 5am, as envisaged by the Government of the Land, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against night air damage.
The coalition must have decided on 4 January if it wishes to file an appeal against the judgment delivered.
The opposition criticises this time limit and tries to pressure the government representative to ensure that the latter submits an appeal to the Federal Administrative Tribunal in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD group Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel invites the CDU and the FDP to return to their promise made before the elections, which consisted of banning night flights. Otherwise, this will be deemed a total failure to a given word.
It is very difficult to be allowed to keep his word, said the Chief of the Greens Tarek Al-Wazir, alluding to the FDP's electoral slogan "We keep our promises".
Minister Dieter Posch refutes the complaints of Schäfer-Gümbel, who claims that the government of the Land is still trying to authorize night flights using "avocacy and rustling".
There is a need for time to carry out a specific legal review.
The coalition does not want to make decisions on the basis of a "first quick impression".
The decision must be legally reliable, says Stefan Müller (FDP).
The interpretation of the opposition concerning the statements of its fraction on the ban on night flights is completely mistaken.
U.S. Banks Pay Back Aid
The large American banks, deeply affected by the crisis, deviate from their links to the state.
The Bank of America announced on Wednesday that it had reimbursed in full to the Treasury $45 billion (over EUR 30 billion), corresponding to the aid granted under the Tarp rescue plan.
The U.S. television channel CNBC reported that Citigroup was also planning to repay the aid received.
Banking institutions are seeking to rid themselves of the restrictions imposed, which accompanied the acceptance of the amounts, such as the limitation of the bonuses allocated to the leaders and the resolution of higher costs.
The Bank of America launched an increase in capital through the sale of securities to investors that gave it 19 billion dollars of fresh money.
The rest of the sum comes from the banks of the bank that are well filled by the sale of several branches from other sectors.
On Wednesday night, Kenneth Lewis, the Director General of the Bank of America, explicitly thanked the US taxpayers: the capital injection helped considerably to overcome a difficult period.
The bank had assumed its capabilities by buying Merrill Lynch's investment bank at the height of the financial turmoil.
The Citigroup also plans to obtain money on the financial markets in order to free itself from state control.
As a result, the U.S. bank could start a 20 billion-dollar capital increase as early as Thursday, reporting the CNBC chain quoting the banking community.
The spokesman for Citigroup did not wish to comment on this information.
In June the Goldman Sachs banks, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had repaid the public funds they had received.
Accelerated election
Finally everything happened even faster than expected.
Just two weeks after the current limo of the post of chief editor Nikolaus Brender by the German ZDF Chain Board, the successor is already appointed.
The committee wanted to vote last night to make the appointment.
Peter Frey who runs the Berlin edition of ZDF was the big favourite.
However, the chain did not wish to confirm - officially - the vote so as not to anticipate the procedure.
However, it appears that there has also been a desire not to harm the ZDF's steward Markus Schächter further if the proposal would not be accepted by the Board of Directors.
Frey, who is the candidate for Schächter, needed the vote of 9 members of the Commission on 14.
The result of the vote was not yet known at the close of the drafting of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter had proposed to the Board of Directors to extend Nikolaus Bender's contract for five years, but this had been rejected.
Only 7 members of the Council voted in favour of the reconstitution of Brender and 7 others voted against. Brender's vote was a failure which was quite predictable for Schächter.
Indeed, the CDU, which is a majority on the Board of Directors, had already heard several weeks before the vote, did not want to bring Bender back to office.
It was Roland Koch, the Minister-President of Hesse Land who had organized a league against the editor-in-chief.
He had refused to extend the contract of the highly esteemed editor-in-chief by referring to the fact that the ZDF's reporting rate had fallen under Bender.
That is why protests were still taking place, almost until the vote, crushing the increasing political influence on the ZDF.
At the end there were even 35 experts in public law who had interfered in the debate and believed that Koch's way of acting was unconstitutional.
But it would have been useless.
Peter Frey: Who is he?
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied political sciences, pedagogy and Roman languages (Spanish).
He then worked in the Südwestfunk (Rhénanie-Palatinate radio agency) and Frankfurter Rundschau (German national citizen).
In 1983 he became editor in the ZDF first in the news magazine "heute-journal" (journal of today).
Then he continued his career: from 1988 to 1990 he was the deputy editor-in-chief of the time; then corresponding to Washington in 1991/1992, then and until 1998 he was chief and presenter of the "Morgenmagazines" (bimonthly information show presented in the morning); until 2001 he was responsible for the foreign policy service of the ZDF and then chief editor of the Berlin edition.
After Brender's disgrace, while he had just been elected a journalist of the year by the specialized magazine Medium Magazine, the Greens announced that they would file a constitutional complaint
Koch's opponent to the Board of Directors, Minister-President of Rhineland-Palatinate Kurt Beck, said last week that the Länder should transform the Intergovernmental Treaty of the ZDF so that the claimant's staff proposals could not be blocked by a political majority.
However, Beck does not consider requesting the withdrawal of political personalities from the ZDF Monitoring Commissions.
Peter Frey, Brender's probable successor had skillfully worked with the Board of Directors by criticising the commission vehemently in his decision as limoger Bender.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to propose it for the post of editor-in-chief without losing his face, as well as the Board of Directors could elect it without being suspected of placing a political partisan in the post.
In the arithmetic representations of the parties, Frey is classified liberal from the left.
Large cleaning in university studies
Partial success for students: after a year of educational strike the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder decided to be more conciliative: at a meeting between Ministers and delegates of the Conference of Directors, an agreement was developed stipulating that the working conditions of the Bachelor or Master students should be improved.
In the future, students should be able to complete their studies.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the weight of the examinations: a single examination must enable the selected study module to be completed.
In addition, the workload must be reconsidered to ensure "realistic and acceptable proportions".
Political authorities and higher education institutions wish to facilitate the recognition of examinations between universities and abroad.
The Länder have also undertaken to organize more flexible common structural requirements for the Bachelor and Master sectors.
At the regional level, there must be no different regulation from one land to another.
Fewer reviews
Since the beginning of the student protests last June, the Minister of Education of the Länder and the directors of universities have constantly spoken the phrase in fashion: "studyability".
But for the first time, this expression seems to take concrete meaning.
The Accreditation Board decided to significantly reduce the number of examinations: "Each module should normally be able to be concluded by a single examination", can be read in a document of about 30 pages on future conditions of admission to university courses.
Reinhold Grimm, Chairman of the Accreditation Board, said that by significantly reducing the burden of examinations, we should be able to stop the derailments, which were significantly detrimental to the studyability.
The "studyability" should also be the decisive criterion for the organization of studies in the future.
Modules as well as the background should be carefully examined to see if you can't avoid this suffocating sensation that sometimes feels in the choice of courses.
Hamburg / Berlin - According to the latest RAID knowledge on Kunduz, the opposition considers that Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate deception.
Students should "have the opportunity and scope of manoeuvre necessary to allow and promote personal initiative".
The new regulation will cover access to new university cycles but will also be adapted to existing cycles.
These cycles must be "reaccredited" every 5 years, which means, however, that it is only by 2015 that all cycles have been examined.
There are 10 competent accreditation agencies throughout the federal territory that depend on the accreditation boards created by the Länder.
In October, the Ministers of Education had put some pressure on the Länder so that they would be in charge of the agencies so that the programmes were not overburdened and the review regime was not too strict.
In some Länder, universities and specialized higher schools have already agreed with their regional ministries to take appropriate measures.
The Rhineland-Palatinate has so far been the only land to have agreed to give more resources to the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities need to organize tutorial programmes and strengthen educational guidance offices as well as review offices and international relations service.
The Länder and universities provide for a budget of EUR 10 million.
In early 2010, the government wishes to table an amendment to the Higher Education Institutions Act to Parliament.
As a result, only one examination will be needed to complete his studies.
The organisation of the studies will need to be more flexible, as well as the recognition of notes from other higher education institutions and the access to the Master must be simplified.
By the end of next year, the "studyability" of all academic cycles will have to be examined.
Last Thursday, the government and the opposition again discussed the issue of study conditions in the country.
Decisions were appreciated but criticisms were heard.
The Federal President of the Union of Socialist Students stated that he would like to see the organization of education policy no longer happen in the future "back closed doors" of ministers and university directors.
At the latest after the educational strike, students as persons concerned should be able to express themselves a little.
The future graduates of higher education were supported by the President of the Delegates of the Conference of Directors (HRK) Margret Wintermantel: "Experience of students is very useful to us" said Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Education of the Länder with whom the HRK works on a joint reform project.
For the Education and Science Union (GEW) the decisions taken in Bonn do not go far enough. It calls for the right and the possibility for each graduate Bachelor to enroll in a Master's cycle.
Andreas Keller member of the GEW Steering Committee also asks that the Länder assure Bachelor students today that there will be enough seats tomorrow for Master studies and conditions of study as good as possible.
The Länder must therefore hire more lecturers.
On the other hand, the Ministers of Education did not mention the possibility of facilitating access to the Master.
More than one footnote on Herta Müller
It is by these words "Arrived in Germany and it is beautiful, almost more control..." that begins a work by the poet Werner Söllner, in which he is themed in shorts of disturbing sentences, the experiences of a dissident who arrived in Germany who has gained freedom but at the same time lost his language territory.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, was first professor of German and English in Bucharest and subsequently director of collection in a youth publishing house before settling in Frankfurt on the Main.
Söllner received several literary awards; in 1993 he held the highly coveted chair of poetry at Goethe University of Frankfurt and since 2002 he has been director of Hesse's literature forum at Mousonturm's artist's house in Frankfurt.
He made a lot of talk about him in non-literary circles last Tuesday, at a convention in Munich, whose theme was "German literature in Romania in the mirror and mirror deformatting your security files".
Visiblely destabilized and embarrassed, Söllner made a statement in which he recognized before his fellow German-Roman writers such as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer as an informant for the Security Policy Police.
Söllner received the German language prize in 1989 jointly with some of the participants.
Recruitment trials had begun insidiously in 1971.
I am, Söllner concludes, "so someone who has not been able to resist security intimidation tests."
The poet Werner Söllner is informant Walter (IM Walter).
Almost simultaneously with the honour of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and its exemplary literary divides with the mechanisms of the power of dictatorship, the literary scene is shaken and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, by a case that clearly shows the absems and the lowness of a political system, based on police surveillance and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we can say from current knowledge, not only guilty but also victim.
In his own Security file, IM Walter played a role, assures literature specialist Michael Markel after Söllner's confession and refers to the positive influence of IM Walter who had interceded in his favor.
"He had been able to get him out of all the difficult situations at the time," says Markel.
Markel felt the moral need to comment.
The form in which Söllner made his statement and in front of this audience was unexpected, however the notice of a former dissident of his collaboration with the Romanian secret services is not, in fact, so surprising.
Germany is a pleasant reserve for security spies had already written Herta Müller in July in the newspaper "Die Zeit", after reading the 914 pages of her own file.
It can be assumed that the victims will have made speculations and sometimes guess what real names were hiding last the names of Sorin, Voicu and Walter borrowings.
On the contrary, Germany where the consultation of Stasi's files has been a reliable process, the attitude towards the legacy of Security's files is still very confusing.
A systematic clarification has been continuously reversed and slowed down in the past few years.
It was only in 1999 that a national council corresponding to the Birthler institution was created to work on the assimilation of the Security Archives (CNSAS) but the restitution of the files has been delayed since.
Since 2005, there has been a law that defines the management of archives.
That the influence of former members of Security in Romania is still very great, is confirmed by the interview of a former Head of Security in Temesvar, who, after the announcement of the award of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller, expresses herself in a very derogatory manner with respect to the winner.
She had a psychosis, and in the end, she was only questioned once.
The infamy of power thought it could express itself here, without any gene, under the cover of freedom of expression.
Of course, many ineligible questions are associated with the Söllner case as it often happens in a context of hidden guilt.
Why now ? Who has been poliated ? The weighted reaction of the listeners, to Söllner, leaves hope that the continuation of this chapter will be more defined by a desire to know than by accusations and a feeling of shame.
On the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Tumults at the Champions League
It was felt that a representative arrived there, shot at four pins coming straight from a nice Christmas party, on which the manufacturer of sports items had spread his goods when the new VFB coach Christian Gross mounted at midnight less the quarter in a Mercedes class C, just called, an orange plastic bag from the supplier's hand.
The man, whose bald skull attracted attention, allowed himself to be led into the city that was still foreign to him.
Otherwise our five-year-old could have taken the wheel himself – he had not drunk alcohol and he was neither drunk with happiness.
He had had a nice evening, but tomorrow we had to resume work.
'Cause now it's gonna start.
The words of Switzerland that we had just committed three days earlier were clear: "We have reached the eighth final," that is, in the league of champions thanks to our 3:1 against Uniera Urziceni of Romania" but we must not let ourselves be blinded by success. It will be a brutal struggle not to recover."
The "great work" awaits us on Sunday.
There, it is about repeating to Mainz the results of the league of champions on a daily basis.
And it will be necessary to overcome the weaknesses that have resurfaced surface after the three expeditionive goals of Marica (5.), Träsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Sort drawing
The eighth final of the Champions League (match go 16/17. + 23./24 February/ match return 9/10. + 16/17. March) will be fired at lots on December 18 in Nyon.
The joy of the fulminant function of Babbel's successor was thus moderate.
And joy was not moderate only in the one who had been lucky, who had passed on to the destabilized Stuttgart professionals, a flawless motivation and the pleasure of playing.
I went to see the players and I told them that they should focus on their assets, I advised them to be more courageous, explained the "bleed of souls" – Gross - the recipe for the success that sounded so many times that did no more effects with the nurse Babbel.
He triggered a certain magic, confessed Jens Lehmann - Babbel's partisan, "in the football when there is a new impulse it sometimes happens things that we would never have thought possible".
And Sami Khedira who, after weeks of pause for injury, advances to the rank of the best player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the " phenomenon" seen by a proverbial "fresh wind" and the new leader's method of work: "Someone who goes into action and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation."
But Babbel had apparently missed it.
VfB Stuttgart hasn't crossed the line yet, cautioned Horst Heldt Manager
For the moment, VfB Stuttgart needs mainly tenacity.
Just like Gross, players and the manager are careful to overestimate the victory against a totally outdated and weakened defence of Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow before having had a bad awakening four days later in Leverkusen with 0:4 , objecta Khedira.
Horst Heldt, the manager, reported that they had achieved one of the objectives of the season but that there were others who were still far away.
We haven't gone through the hard way yet.
That Heldt on the day of his 40th anniversary did not have the heart to celebrate, even after the first home victory for three months, is due to the weekend events that a television interview by the goalkeeper Jens Lehmann had rebounded just before the start of the game.
There are decisions that others make and not Jens would counter Heldt in response to Lehmann's acute criticism.
He had accused the management of weak style and said she had decided to change coaches under pressure from puberty fans.
Lehmann had also judged as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jealousy that his day off after the games had been eliminated.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by pure selfishness" led Heldt and announced consequences for the goal keeper.
They were no longer at risk of becoming friends for life these two quadranglers.
In any case, they agreed for everything else, i.e. that without the pre-work of the group by the replacement coach, strong sport and combative representation would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants were "for a large part in success" twisted Heldt and Lehmann in choir – and even the man in the plastic bag aquiesca.
Heavyweight World Championship
Hot fight in Bern: Kevin Johnson the challenger continually provoked verbally and managementally the champion of the world Vitali Klitschko.
But after twelve difficult rounds the Ukrainian defended his world heavyweight champion according to the WBC Federation's version.
At the unanimity of the judges, the points are required.
Hamburg – Vitali Klitschko retains its world heavyweight champion title.
The WBC Federation announced that on Saturday night the 38-year-old champion had won a win at the points at the unanimity of the judges against the American Kevin Johnson (120:10).
For the third time Klitschko has been defending his title since his comeback on stage in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian had already won twice the WBO and WBC Federation World Champion.
Unfortunately he didn't make the KO so expected.
Klitschko, released 39 times winner in 41 professional fights, had to confess twice his defeat due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept his first defeat at the 24th battle.
In the Berne Arena, in front of 17,000 spectators, the great Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight, from the top of its 2.02 meters, against the left.
Johnson, of eleven centimeters smaller that had announced the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, was able to avoid the beats of the champion, thus pushing Klitschko to get his dangerous right into play.
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, has mainly tried to pass the rounds.
Although he continues to provoke Klitschko in words and actions his blows only rarely reached the champion.
He was still the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in the year 2000, having exceeded the distance of the twelve rounds with Klitschko.
The challenger had made a lot of noise in the capital of Switzerland before the battle.
He insulted Klitschko and treated him as a "violent zombie" who "is not really capable".
During the heavy Friday, the champion could not help causing Johnson to fall his nose sunglasses "in order to see his eyes."
Fourth win since Klitschko's comeback.
Klitschko again stood up in his fourth fight since his comeback on 11 October 2008
After a break of almost four years, he had beaten Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin at the time and recovered "his" WBC belt that he had previously given up without a fight.
This year, defending his champion title, he won the fight against Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September against Chris Areola of the USA.
"I just took a shot in this fight and I'm in perfect shape," Klitschko said to explain his quick return to the ring.
His dream is to try to bring together the four most important titles in the family.
His brother Wladimir is champion of the WBO and IBF federations.
But it is British David Haye who, having dethroned the great Nikolai Walujew - 2.13 meters - in November, wears the belt of the WBA.
This summer, Haye had cancelled a game against Vitali Klitschko that was scheduled to take place in September.
It would seem that his promotional company is now planning to play this game at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack of the opposition: the head of the Green Group, Jürgen Trittin, accused the Minister of Defence Guttenberg of lying in the case of the Kunduz Affairs.
The SPD and La Gauche parties (Die Linke) ask the chancellor for explanations.
Hamburg/Berlin - After examining the latest information on the Kunduz air strike, the opposition accused Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) of deliberately concealing certain facts.
The Minister intentionally "formed a contraverity" on the murder strike of two tank trucks last September," said the head of the Greens parliamentary group, Jürgen Trittin, on Saturday during the issuance of information from the ARD chain "Tagesschau" (the 20h newspaper).
Clearly, that means he lied.
The order to kill has been given to the total disregard of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
It is essentially the contents of the report available to NATO and which was read by Mr Guttenberg, said Trittin.
Last Friday, according to new media revelations, the goal of the strike was in reality not to destroy the stolen trucks, but to eliminate two important Taliban leaders.
According to NATO's investigation report, 142 persons were killed or injured during the U.S. air attack that had been launched at the request of German Colonel Goerg Klein, Military Commander of Kunduz.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left asked on Saturday, chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU), to speak as soon as possible before the Federal Parliament and to reveal what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and his colleague from the Green Renate Künast Party are of the view that Mrs Angela Merkel must state clearly whether the targeted massacre strategy is part of the Afghan policy of the Federal Government if the chancellor, the army and the intelligence services approved this new strategy.
The Government's spokesman categorically rejected these criticisms.
The chancellory has in no way influenced the army's interventions in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturdays, voices were increasing to express doubts about the real reasons behind the referral of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert, as presented by the Ministry.
According to the SPIEGEL newspaper, the information they had provided to Guttenberg regarding the attack on tank trucks was both correct and complete.
Officially, they would have concealed the existence of the NATO report and hid some embarrassing details from the Minister.
However, in the vicinity of the two senior officials, it is suggested that they informed the Ministry of Defence of the existence of several reports, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein and a report by the military police.
The "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert would have requested in a mail a clarification of the facts.
To date, he has not received a reply
On Saturday, the Department did not wish to comment on these charges and referred to the Federal Parliament's Committee of Inquiry which was to be established on Wednesday to shed light on the facts in question.
The Worlds of Dream
Some see, all awake, images and hear voices that no one else sees or hears.
There is only in psychic patients, or under the effect of drugs, that the limits between imagination and reality are confused.
As long as these phenomena manifest themselves during sleep, everything is fine.
When we are lying in our dark rooms, we can unhindered our dreams and the craziest ghosts.
However, the one who, awake, experiences the state of dream, hears and sees things that others do not perceive, quickly has the reputation in our Western world of being crazy or drugged, or at least being an original.
Such images and voices only appear in psychic patients or under the effect of drugs.
It is our imagination that is involved: it is the same neuronal activity that allows us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, but sometimes stimulates the limits between dream, madness and reality to melt.
A conscious state of awakening, taking the form of a dream, can present itself in the most diverse forms, in the best case it is called visions, to the worst of madness.
But even if the trigger and effect are distinguished, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiments of the prophet of the New Age Carlos Castaneda, the second states of the shamans, psychoses and hallucinations are due to very similar processes.
There are hallucinations or delusions when the balance, neurotransmitter substances of the brain - primarily dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - is broken and the interaction between the different parts of the brain is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and delirious thoughts occur very often during schizophrenia.
The ground attraction force no longer has power over the person.
Since antiquity, philosophers and doctors have always considered the relationship between madness and dream.
For Aristotle, hallucinations were a form of wake-up dream; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, observed in 1861 "a great similarity between madness and dream", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis with all the irregularities, imaginations, delusions and sensory illusions that compose it".
We are in the fall of 2001 when Henning T becomes a character of a comic strip.
Its body is in two dimensions with created colors.
Earth's attraction has no more power over it, it runs at the edge of the ceiling.
He's feeling like he's having a stroke.
Behind him were creatures of evil winged, grumaking, bloody mouth, showing the teeth.
They pursue him, they kick his feet with heavy flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels pain all over his body.
Tonigning voices, wicked voices, screaming, coming out of walls and radio.
He can no longer support these voices that insult him and humiliate him.
Henning T. pulls two cables from its stereo chain, in fact a loop and the attachment to a hook fixed to the ceiling.
He climbs on a baffle and passes the loop around his neck.
He jumps.
The loop's off.
Let it serve as a lesson, shout out the voices in a choir to remove his earplug. "Go to a clinic and get yourself taken care of!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he experienced six acute psychosis, the last date of 2 years, the first of early 20 years.
It was triggered by the LSD.
Diagnosis: schizo-affective psychosis, paranoid, besides it is manic-depressive, it takes drugs against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He learned to live with his illness, and he has been married for three years.
During the psychosis I experienced terrible fears and deep despair.
Illusions are a cruel reality.
About one percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia at least once; in psychiatric clinics it is the most common disease after depression.
In a crisis of schizophrenia, the people concerned can no longer make a difference between the inner world and the outside world, they are in a state of hyper excitation, which makes them suffering from hallucinations, megalomania, relational madness or persecution.
It is very common to hear voices – voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are not uncommon either.
The person concerned can no longer distinguish between the important and insignificant, the brain can no longer filter disruptive signals, the consciousness is drowned under the sensations.
Like the dream, psychosis opens the locks to a flood of ideas and ghosts coming from the deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis focuses on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the department of psychiatry of the CHU of Heidelberg (Allgemeine Psychiatry im Universitätsklinikum) .
Schizophrene is located in the center of the situation, with a meaning centered on it.
At the same time it is in a passive role, it is like in a dream, overcome by events and cannot act actively on them.
That is why schizophrenia often feels threatened, controlled, manipulated.
In general they do not have the opportunity to adjust reality, illusions are a cruel reality, waking up is excluded.
Experience once in his life of hallucination.
Unlike the dream, according to Fuchs, "the sensory and spatial structure of reality that is perceived during psychosis is essentially preserved".
Delirious thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of life takes place in a real setting.
Why does our brain make these kinds of goats, it's always a puzzle for researchers.
Exceptional situations can lead everyone to lose perception of reality temporarily, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factors.
Researchers assume that the individuals concerned have minor brain injuries.
It is assumed that neural maturation of the brain is disturbed at an early stage of development, for example by a mother's viral infection during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But what is still unexplained is the way the neuronal system anomaly occurs and also the fact that it does not manifest itself for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role – stress or traumatic experience can be a trigger for psychosis if there is a predisposition.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis because they act on neurotransmitters.
When our brain warms up.
What's crazy, Professor of Psychology Erich Kasten from Lübeck tells us is that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive drugs to get rid of them while others buy expensive drugs to get them.
The pleasant or unpleasant perception of illusions is often just a matter of view.
Kasten has been gathering reports for ten years on hallucinations and phenomena of illusory images: last year he published his results in a book entitled "The Unreal World in Our Mind".
hallucinations are part of the concomitant phenomena typical of psychoses as well as an impressive number of other pathologies.
Among them are mental disorders such as borderline or depression, but also migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease or head injury.
It is surprising that under certain conditions the brain of healthy people is subject to hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of fragments of memories that are normally inhibited.
They take shape when brain areas that treat sensory perceptions are hyperactive or not sufficiently retarded; when our brain is heated but also when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this state as well as brain injury or psychosis.
But also the lack of stimulation, stress, sorrows of love or other exceptional mental states.
In recent studies, one third of participants acknowledge that they have experienced hallucination at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, 16-year-old Sarah K. lived in a small town in Mecklembourg-Pomerania and went to high school.
A girl to do normal, really.
If there weren't the images and the voices.
During recreation, it happens that a young boy, thin, with long brown hair, speaks to him.
When she answers her friends look at her, surprised – no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think this shy girl is a lunatic dreamer but Sarah K doesn't dream, she's sure.
She is awake, hears and sees this boy just as she sees and hears the girl sitting next to her on the bench.
She may even perceive her presence momentarily.
It's a pleasant feeling, she finds this nice young man.
Am I crazy?, she sometimes asks.
But she well knows that this young man and other visions are not real and will disappear again.
In the evening the apparitions are generally frightening.
The visions are often heavy.
When she is in class, she may not be able to follow the course because the teacher is just presenting a new student in her eyes and ears while she is invisible to others and that the teacher is visibly explaining equations in the table.
In the evening the apparitions are generally frightening.
When, in the darkness of her room, she waits for sleep that occurs too rarely and too late, she cannot often make a distinction if she is awake or dreamy already, if the images she sees, the grumpy faces or the young girl with bloody laces on her arms and legs are in front of her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, she screams at these creatures.
She doesn't talk about it to her parents or friends, they'd take it for crazy.
Fall 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
She had her bac last year and she lives with her friend.
One year ago, hallucinations stopped.
Since she came into contact over the Internet with psychologist Kasten she knows very well that she's not crazy.
Madness is also an art work of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or not sufficiently stimulated, the probability is great that he or she has hallucinations at some point.
I guess the brain isn't busy enough, so there's animation.
Sarah K., the only girl, was afraid of other children when she was little and often played alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at the age of 13, that the man she called Dad, since she was old to think, was not her real father.
These are the same brain zones that are active for visual and acoustic hallucinations, and for real impressions and sounds, it is therefore very difficult for people like Sarah K to make the difference between illusion and reality. "Each experience", says Kasten "has taken place in the brain, reality is formed from there.
The hallucinations are also images that form in the brain, which is why they seem so real."
For Kasten, night dreams are also a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those in acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenia, the mentally healthy person is able to recognize that ghosts are not real images.
Kasten therefore advises his patients to cherish hallucinations as a particular talent.
There is only one step between dream and hallucination.
Unfortunately, in our world too focused on consciousness there has been a tendency to take imaginary experiences for pathologies, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and chief physician at the Psychiatry and Psychotherapy clinic at Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful disease but it also contains something positive, creator - madness is an art work of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied the form of so-called oniroid experience, a particular form of the modification of consciousness awakened by the dream.
Onioid lives are very complex half-dreams that are perceived as real by the one who lives them and that he cannot differentiate from the dream even when he is awake.
The state of onioid consciousness manifests itself during trauma or in situations of extreme pathologies as for patients with fully aware polyradiculopathy, experience an motor paralysis.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of self and the world, due to a total and lasting inability to move, he replaces this real situation that damages his life, by his own imaginary world that is dissociated from reality.
It is a state of mental limitation between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a world change takes place but the real situation is represented in imagination.
It is, in fact, an intense form of means and interpretation, in an intolerable situation, a capacity of organization which is given to us men, so as not to darken in the void of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real even later in memories.
Zurichois Peter Cornelius Classen, an art historian, also describes his onioid experiences in his book "Heart Change" as a safeguard action of the soul.
He is 49 years old, when his conscious leaves for a journey of several days after the operation of a heart valve followed by a transplant; during that time, his body is condemned to remain motionless in resuscitation.
Claussen dives into a world that he has created of all parts, visits of foreign places, travels in time. He sees himself as an old man raised in a railway sanatorium, a robot at his hair watch over his health.
He lives in the middle age among nobles who manufacture blood-based drugs.
He is taken away by a Greek motorcycle that takes him to his country, surfs with his hospital bed in the snow of the Alps and meets a Korean mafia.
It absorbs completely into this imaginary world, everything is real even later in his memories.
According to Claussen these interior travels are fundamentally different from any dream.
The dream is a completely different state, he writes describing what he experienced.
Instead of dreams, memories from mental travel are extremely clear and very detailed even years later.
It can even be said that they are much more distinct and more intensive than real life.
The intensity of this life sparks the horizon of our other daily experiences, according to the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, onioid delusions, psychosis, hallucinations and psychedelic experiences show us how fragile our inner representations of external reality are even in a state of vigilance.
Any change in the state of consciousness, sums up psychologist Kasten "may cause a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be quite enriching.
The first snows can fall
Burda
At 27 years of age, the children will follow up on the publishing house.
Kallen's appointment as CEO of Burda Editions is an intermediate solution: in the longer term, Hubert Burda wishes his two children to resume the press group, he told Spiegel.
The holding must remain 100% a family business.
Hamburg - In the long term, the publisher Hubert Burda sees his society in the hands of his children
The two children will inherit at 27 years of age and are firmly determined to integrate society, said Hubert Burda, 69, at Spiegel.
All details have been settled in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will arise later.
It will also be necessary to see if they are able to do so.
Children cannot be imposed on 7500 employees without knowing whether they have the capacity to handle them.
This would demolish children as well as the company.
Burda had announced last Thursday that he would retire from the position of President-Director-General as of January and that his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, aged 52, has been a member of the Board of Directors since 1999.
He was primarily responsible for the technology sector.
He then took care of the Treasury sector, that is, he was responsible for the company's capital and after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer he also took the lead in marketing, foreign sector, printing and finance.
So for the first time it is not a member of the family who is at the head of the Burda editions.
Burda's children were 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who was now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
Kallen's appointment also serves to link the next 10 or 15 years"
Burda states that the holding must remain 100% in the hands of the family.
The ruins have always taken place in the families that have been trained by a bulimia of capital, which have made enormous unfortunate speculations thinking that they could climb ever higher.
This has never been my strategy.
I've never had a dream of universal power, Burda said.
I absolutely do not see myself in the role of the country's preceptor as Springer could be and I do not intend to be part of these international leagues like Time, these companies have taken too much importance.
Entire beauty
Everything you can desire, with regard to beauty and well-being, at hand.
This is the aim that El Corte Inglés has set itself, which has just opened up in the shopping centre of Callao (Madrid), a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2, dedicated to the care and attention of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, houses prestigious signs such as Hedonai, laser hairdresser, Spaxion, with its relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments, Luis & Tachi, hairdressers, Marina d'Or, who has a gym, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a ray of food, with in particular a tea room, which offers more than 130 different types of tea.
Spaxion offers you, among other things, to enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner, while contemplating the exceptional views of the capital, or to rent for two hours the relaxation area in order to organize your own " Beauty Party" with eight of your friends and relax thanks to a session of jacuzzi, massages while having a glass of champagne.
In total, it is 250 m2 divided into 12 rooms, where you can benefit from the most innovative facial, body and hydrotherapy.
Like, for example, cavitation to fight cellulite or vibrating platforms.
The sports room also has these devices, as well as virtual "trainers" that guide the steps of customers, offering them a fully personalized treatment.
Everything begins with the introduction of your personal code on a touch screen, located in front of the device.
Several videos then show us how to do our exercise program properly.
His director ensures that 15 minutes (heating and stretching included) are sufficient to work all the muscles of the body.
And, if after having made our body work, we want to go through the hairdressing salon, the sign Luis & Tachi has a room where we offer rituals of repair of hair, brightness or nutrition, all personalized.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the order words of this urban spa, which will be opened every day of the year from 10 a.m. to 10 a.m.
Miscellaneous take-offs
Christmas is approaching and it is never unnecessary to study the look of stars to adapt it to our party wardrobe.
The shape of the decolletity, which is very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the variables that we must consider.
Here are a few suggestions.
The singer Fergie has chosen an exaggerated and very complicated take-off. This is not very recommended.
Endesa and Barcelona are equipped with the electric car
The Endesa electric company, in collaboration with the Barcelona City Hall, created the "Live Office".
This is a project aimed at developing and promoting the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The "Live Office" will define and coordinate the roadmap for the construction of the electric car in the city and will establish mobility agreements, by taking steps, coordinating, providing subsidies, etc.
In addition, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
Finally, the idea is to launch what will become the transport of the future.
3 "electric cities"
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the installation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville join the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government, under the MOVELE Plan, to launch the installation of the electric car.
The Endesa electric company has already signed an agreement with the Generalitat de Catalunya.
Its objective is to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These include energy-related activities, in particular energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative Endesa participates in with regard to the promotion of the electric car.
The company participates in European standardisation groups and has a series of complementary projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE under way.
Zapatero invites "a future of tranquility" for the engine sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, asked "a future of tranquility" for the Spanish automotive industry, which, he recalled, is the country's main export sector.
At the presentation of the Economic Report of the President of the Government for 2009, Zapatero recalled the measures undertaken by the executive during the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without the Competitiveness Plan of the automotive sector, we would have today a landscape of abandonment, closure of some of our main production sites," said the President of the Government.
"With this plan and the decision of the brands to remain in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can consider a future of tranquillity for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Integrated Plan for the Automobile Sector (IPA), devoted 800 million euros to the projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which mobilized an investment of more than €3,000 million.
The Chief Executive explained that this investment was intended both for the development of new models and for the modernization of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also focused on government demand support measures, in reference to Plan 2000E, put in place in collaboration with autonomous communities and automotive companies.
According to the President, this plan reduced the average emissions of new vehicles marketed on the Spanish market by 6 per cent and contributed to a "great increase" of registrations, which increased by "40 per cent" in November.
20 000 m2 of collection cars
Madrid welcomes the first edition of the International Exhibition of Collection Cars, a meeting space for professionals and enthusiasts of the engine world.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Pavilón de Cristal de la Casa de Campo de Madrid.
This is an exposure area of 20,000 m2, where more than 200 national and international exhibitors will be present.
Not only can we find motorcycles and collection cars, but we will also find in ClassicAuto Madrid articles of any kind related to the world of the engine.
For example, among the exponents of the pavilion, we will be able to find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, supplements, magazines, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of items related to the world of the collection engine that will make collectors and curious.
Among the participating companies, we will find, among other things, Classics of Mos and Good Old Times, car sales specialists, Juan Lumbreras, restaurant, Coupe-Francisco Pueche, car sales and restoration, or Cochera Classics, Mercedes Benz specialist.
External aptitude test
But the trade activity of this fair will also include parallel activities: gatherings, sports exhibitions, aptitude tests, presentations and competitions.
Skill tests with cars and collection motorcycles will also take place on an equipped circuit outside the exhibition park.
Mazda3 i-Stop: A sustainable sports spirit
Mazda intends to prove that the sports spirit is not angry with respect for the environment.
To this end, it has just incorporated the engine stop and start-up system i-Stop, a device which, at least for the time being, is only available on the petrol 2.0 engine of 150 horses.
This second generation of Mazda3 is illustrated by the good note it has obtained as a whole.
The details, the finishing of the vehicle, the housing, the behaviour, the mechanics, the i-Stop system...
All these aspects are remarkable on the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driving position, it turns out that the front seats have excellent ergonomics and fixation.
The touch of the wheel is also particularly pleasant.
Continuing with the set formed by the control panel and the console, we see how Mazda continued in the Japanese trend of creating a futuristic interior design, with many buttons and controls, as well as bright colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of the Honda Civic.
That is why we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Japanese, both of them, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and especially with the Gulf of Volkswagen, that they all want to overcome.
By continuing with the cabin, this compact Japanese car has more than enough housing to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
In addition to all this, a large box is added to the regular forms.
The engine stop and start-up system, at least for the moment, is only available on the two-liter petrol engine and 150 horses and with manual change of the six speeds.
This engine is a real happiness. It is shown by its fineness, low noise, performance and control of its consumption.
Indeed, although the most requested Mazda3 are diesel models, those that do not make a large number of kilometres a year should not exclude this i-Stop with gasoline engine, both for its high speed comfort and for its controlled consumption.
Regarding the level of equipment, the model chosen for the test is Sportive, i.e. the one with the largest number of serial elements.
Among the serial equipment, the track change assistant (RVM) that removes the dead angle, traction and stability controls, the speed controller, the photosensitive interior mirror, the dashboard computer on a large screen, parking sensors, independent air conditioning, the rain and light sensor, the bluetooth and the bluetooth audio, as well as the 17-inch alignment wheels, are particularly remarkable.
Furthermore, as if this equipment was not sufficient, this version had the Premium Pack which, for 1,500 euros more, includes among other elements of bi-xenon adaptable lighthouses and a BOSE audio system with disc charger.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its category.
It is particularly illustrated by the quality of the materials used, its behaviour and its high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not make many kilometres a year will be able to opt for the i-Stop version only associated with the petrol 2.0 engine of 150 horses.
The only disadvantage of this model is its high price, which is between €21,770 for the Luxury finish and €23,270 for the tested model, the Sportive.
In return for this significant amount, Mazda3 will offer us a great deal of satisfaction every day.
Luxury "First"
L.A. covers the red carpet of sensuality incarnate by Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars have more than ever dazzled us, dressed in models as elegant as sexy for the coming out of Nine. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as sophisticated as usual, had opted for a dark lady.
The promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that only allows to look at his e-mail, without offering the possibility would be to see certain types of attachments or to navigate on the Internet.
He took advantage of his five-minute glory in the United States, when Time magazine designated him as one of the products of the year.
Indeed, it is more difficult to see it on the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike Smartphones, Peek offers a very low monthly price and subscription, less than half of what costs, for example, the iPhone's date subscription.
In view of its success, the company launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free life data service, six times more expensive than Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the The Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
He is just as limited as his American grandfather, but he has a surprise.
The price of its monthly subscription, about 12 euros, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a Smartphone already know what it means to give up data when you cross a border or look desperately for a café on the Wifi (or a Fon connection) to see your mail.
The idea of roaming at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and it should work for a long time.
In fact, some operators have special arrangements and travel options, but as far as I'm concerned, I would need to have done a thesis in physics to understand them and have good glasses to read the small characters.
The repeated reminders from the European Commission to propose affordable roaming tariffs throughout Europe have had a barely perceptible effect.
Outside the country of origin, we hesitate to use the data, and we're not wrong.
That a small device like the FonPeek (it is always curious that its name is Fon while it does not have Wifi) offers these types of tariffs, means that operators begin to think differently and study various proposals to make their data network profitable.
Kindle is another good example, it includes downloading books and other research on the Internet.
No subscription and no installment.
It is a connected device and is paid when it is purchased and not every month.
And this is what I hope to see one day for the FonPeek: an option to buy with access to life as Peek already proposes in the United States.
Not that I want to buy it.
I'm looking at my mail on my phone, thank you.
I just want it because I think it's a fairer formula for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
Michelle's favorite color
Yellow is undoubtedly the preferred color of the first lady in the United States.
If she went to the position of Barack Obama in the US presidency with a dress and a coat of this color, she chose the same to accompany her in the second moment, undoubtedly the most important of her life: the surrender to Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama wore a very similar model on these two occasions: in addition to their similar color, a green yellow with bright reflections, twice, the dress was made up of three pieces: the dress, the jacket and the coat, in the same fabric, and was adorned with a large embroidery or necklace.
So although at first glance, it would seem that the first lady of the United States followed the seat of the Princess of Asturias and chose to give back the same outfits.
But the fabric in which the two sets are carved makes them very different.
If it was a thick lace for the operation, however, it brought a printed veil to Oslo.
The accessories are also different: medium heel green shoes for the first occasion, and a similar, but golden model this time.
The hairstyle also changed: the hair is now raised while she was wearing the hairless hairs the previous time.
75% of working mothers have had professional problems because of their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of young generations who want to be mothers.
This is reflected in the study "Féconity and professional career of women in Spain", carried out by the CSIC in collaboration with the Institute of Women.
The survey, carried out on 9,737 women aged 15 to 75, leaves no doubt: 75% of working mothers have seen their careers limited due to maternity.
The study indicates that there are many differences regarding the beginning of life in couples and the number of children, whether or not women work and the type of employment occupied.
Those who do not have activity outside the home, work part-time or have an unstable job, get married earlier, have their first pregnancy earlier and have more children.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, are reluctant to enter marriage and the first pregnancy, and have fewer children.
Women between 35 and 49 years of age with a fixed job have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after settling in a couple. This figure goes to 4.1 among those who work in the public sector."These data show that women with a stable job have needed more time in their lives to obtain it, which has led them to push away the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of employment exercised largely influences maternity, but less the starting date of common life," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that increases the gap in the age of women's marriage and their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of training, the more they marry and have their first child late.
The difference is also maintained among women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49 age group, those who conducted elementary and higher studies were mothers for the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 years on average.
"Another distinction is also found among women, depending on their level of study.
While those who have done elementary studies marry and have their first child before finding a stable job, those who have done intermediate or higher studies reverse this program and give priority to achieving stable work as a precondition for marriage and the arrival of a child," says Delgado.
Diane Kruger is also worth it.
The Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its jealous list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
Starting next year, the German actress will incarnate the image of several brand products, ringing the universal motto "Because I value it well".
The protagonist of Joyeux Noël, one of the most elegant actresses on the international stage, is thus joined by other celebrities inscribed at L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spanish Penelope Cruz.
Before her, the last ones to enter this club if selected were the actresses Evangeline Lilly (Lost) and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millionaire).
In men, the cosmetics brand also includes luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (Dr. Grey, anatomy lessons) and Matthew Fox (evangeline's companion in Lost).
The prices of British fashion
The British have a lot to say in the world of fashion.
His greatest representatives, creators and models, from yesterday and today, met for the annual award of their prize, which took place in London, at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one missed the appointment.
Former model Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, elected Best model of the year.
The ace poker of Manuel Vincent
Manuel Vincent offers us in Poquer de aces (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) about thirty "radiographies" of writers who have crossed his literary life (and sometimes his other life).
It does not according to predictable and apprehended genres (biographic summary, life and work), but by seeking something similar to the ignition core of the created character.
The trip is exciting and Vincent spares neither the friars nor the lights.
Delicious pleasure, this book is also a moving invitation to reading and reading.
I'll leave you here for a few moments.
On Albert Camus: "In his pages, I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical impulse, that very one I felt without naming it: the pleasure against doom, morals without guilt and innocence without any god."
On Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote what he had in the blood, not in the head, between impotence and ignorance, with a poetic humour dazzling, meaningless, like the blade of the knife that nearly killed him."
On Graham Greene: "Our man was inspired by this woman of a passion that lasted thirteen years, in the flesh of which he conjured the emotion of adultery to the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted of reaching heaven through the path of perdition."
On James Joyce: "The Ulysse was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. This is one of the eight thousand-metre summits of the universal literature, which must be engraved on the north side, on which the best mountaineers are still leaving and always taken."
On William Faulkner: "He was a strange guy.
On his own, he sometimes said he was the heir to a land owner of the county and at other times that he was the son of a black man and a crocodile.
These two dreams were great."
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer collects the demented cry from a bridge by this character of Munch to bring his echo to the bottom of the night of the 20th century, in his literary form, and he made it in the escape of himself and invoking the posteriority with a violent speech to the attic."
On Dorothy Parker: "One day she knelt and prayed: "God dear, I beg you to stop writing like a woman."
On Joseph Conrad: "On his tomb were engraved the verses of Spenser: "The sleep after the effort, / after the storm the port, / the rest after the war, / after the life, tired the death resumed."
On Virginia Wolf: "In her luggage she also carried her depressions.
Her husband generally agreed that she would tell her that Edward VII was spying on her among the azaleas or that the birds were singing in Greek.
We have never seen a man as patient and in love with a neuroses whose literary talent went beyond madness."
On Pío Baroja: "What did Martín-Santos do if it wasn't about trying to hide Joyce from Baroja?
What is Benet trying if it's not to have Baroja shot by Faulkner?
What did this do if it was not to aspire to this man's glory to serve him as a pedestal?"
A cowardly aggression
Last week, my mother, who was about 70 years old, walked into our neighborhood of the city of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people aged 15 to 18 passed by her and our dog, a blood-melon, saved from the SPA and weighed no more than six kilos, and without saying a word, they sat at her two feet that left the dog severely injured.
Our indignation is immense because we don't see what's funny about attacking a little defenseless animal free of charge, which was also in the desert.
It is necessary to add to this the indignation of a lady who walked quietly and who, when she insulted these individuals, comes to fear for her physical integrity, since an energy that attacks an animal is able to do the same to a woman, a child, an old man or, ultimately, any person less than he.
The episode took place around 5 p.m., one Tuesday like another, in a usually quiet neighborhood.
The dog moaned all day.
We have, of course, filed a complaint with the neighborhood police station even though we doubt that it is useful and not to touch the sensibilities, we just want to make it clear that the killer cowards were Spanish.
Indignity has led us to denounce this fact.
We don't understand what's going on with young people so they find it fun to abuse a defenseless animal free of charge that gives us affection, friendship and keeps us company.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people has gone.
Michelin and Fesvial, fittings for the wearing of the helmet
The manufacturer of Michelin tires, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), launched a campaign to encourage the port of the helmet, mainly among the younger motorcyclists, as the two structures indicated today.
The aim of this initiative is to raise awareness of the importance of wearing the helmet, since it is the only protective element to avoid head injuries, or even death, in the event of a two-wheeled accident.
Michelin stated that this campaign was part of his commitment to road safety, which " went beyond the design and manufacture of increasingly safer products" and affirmed that it contributed to this objective through other educational and informative actions.
This new 2-wheeled helmet port encouragement campaign, under the motto "To be or not to be", will include a first phase in which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle garages in order to ensure its widest dissemination.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, because as a tire manufacturer for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main objectives is to develop increasingly secure products.
The sale of light commercial vehicles progresses
After almost two years, the light commercial vehicle market begins to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9 425 vehicles registered in Spain in November represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decrease, according to the figures of the employer union of manufacturers Anfaf and of Ganvam, that of dealers.
However, the good news should be noted, since the reference used for the comparison in November 2008 was particularly bad, with a 60% decrease compared to the previous year.
Consequently, despite the rebound of last month, the registrations accumulated during these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous financial year.
Since January, if all vehicles entering the category of light commercial vehicles (derived from passenger cars, pick-up cars, vans, light vans and light chassis trucks) 95 853 have been sold.
Large clouds that affect most of their demand have not been dissipated. Indeed, although they are also purchased by individuals, most purchases are made by small or medium-sized enterprises, which pay in almost 100% of cases through external funding.
Thus, in addition to the restrictions involved in the limitation of bank credits, other factors such as the increase in unemployment or the persistence of the poor economic environment need to be added.
In view of this situation and the difference between tourism vehicles, aid for the purchase of 2000E has been of little use.
In addition to individuals, independents and SMEs wishing to acquire a light commercial vehicle of less than 3.5 tonnes with a level of CO2 emissions not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre, they may also benefit, but the number of operations speaks of themselves.
Yesterday, at Ganvam, we reiterated the need for administration to focus particular attention on these vehicles as well as industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The concessionaires' association provides for a year 2010 similar to the one ending, for which it calculates a drop in sales (tourism vehicles and 4x4) of 19%.
Emergency braking aid is now mandatory
As this has happened with the ABS brake anti-lock system and as it will happen with the ESP stability control, emergency brake support systems will be a mandatory element on European cars.
They are already mandatory on newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for the rest of the vehicles a period of deficiency has been fixed until the end of February 2011.
The aim of the measure, imposed by the European Union, is to strengthen the protection of pedestrians, even though, by its way of action, it can also help to avoid many rear shocks.
The emergency brake assistant acts by increasing the pressure on the brakes in case of an emergency detected by the system thanks to the driver's kick.
But the latter does not always hold the pressure until the end.
According to a study conducted by the Bosch car component manufacturer, one third of the drivers involved in an accident had not been able to support the brake before the collision, and half of them had not taken full advantage of its strength.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, in return, requires the maximum brake system, reducing the distance the car needs to stop.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with such elements, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided each year.
This reduction would be even more important with the popularization of these intelligent emergency braking systems: it is estimated that one in four fatalities with injured people would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that, thanks to a radar or a camera, detects obstacles and prevents the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it helps by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and although the collision is inevitable, the device shall exert the maximum effort on the brakes in order to minimize damage.
General Motors rejects the plan for Opel until January
While workers at the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Saragosse) were warned by Nick Reilly, the new President of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva would be launched during the first week of April – probably on 8 – according to Javier Ortega, the North American manufacturer warned that it would take more time to complete the Opel relief plan.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, believes that each point of the plan has previously been approved by the party concerned.
And this may imply that the final document, which will first be submitted to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where the factories are located, be postponed until the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, at GM, it is ensured that a decision on the sale of Saab should be made in the next few days.
It is not surprising, therefore, that the Swedish government has tightened pressure on the US manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in contact with potential new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the candidacy of the Dutch Skyper sports car manufacturer, supported by the Russian Converg group, takes importance.
In case there would be no agreement with any of them, GM could sell part of Saab to the Chinese company Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
Flying the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To design their last and precious jewel, Porsche engineers left Boxster S and managed to reduce it from nothing less than 80 kilos, leaving the balance to only 1,275 kilos.
This led them to pass, firstly, the automatic roof which was replaced by a manual ground roof, allowing to reduce by 21 kilos, to use aluminum doors such as those of the GT3, 15 other kilos less, to remove the air conditioner, 13 kilos, to reduce the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres, 7 kilos of winnings, to mount sports baccutes, 12 kilos, and with light tires of 19 inches, five kilos.
Finally, they gave up the CDR-30 audio system, winning six more kilograms and replaced the handles of doors with handles of fabric, saving the remaining kilo.
Although the model also exists with the double clutch PDK box, the test was performed on a six-speed manual box model, mainly on roads of the California secondary network, in the mountains, with particularly tortuous turns.
His behaviour can only be described as irreprehensible.
The weight reduction does not prevent the car from rolling on the ground with aplomb.
On the contrary: it has been a long time since we have tested such a small and light model that, at the same time, guarantees such safety in the turns, including at high speed.
It is a small athlete, able to warm his muscles at small speed during the time necessary, until we ask him to squeeze, brake, recover and push his engine again...
That's what we wanted. Thanks to its direction, as communicative as well as precise, the car will do as our hands will indicate on the wheel.
And she'll do it with surgical precision.
Engine sound at will
The sound of its V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be strengthened with the "sport" option or thanks to a system that changes the engine rust, already used on the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, whether at shutdown or during recovery.
The suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The cover of the roads we travelled with the Boyxster Spyder was quite damaged, but the car managed the chicken nests well.
Electronic assistants barely showed presence on the whole route, while on some turns we found verglas in the early morning and gravel later in the morning.
Ultimately, an ultra-light car, the most entertaining to drive and which is much more than just a change of Boxster S.
The car will be sold in February 2010, at a price of 70,831 euros.
Bag Girl
Karl Lagerfeld's intimate friend, an icon of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional starlet of the parades of the house, the singer shows her face as bad a girl with as much container as her Chanel bags.
More than a "Bad Girl" or an "It Girl" is a "bag Girl".
Baskonia offers victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral won a triumph at 91-82 during its visit to the fiery terrain of Maccabi Electra, despite the many absences suffered by the team of Dusko Ivanovic. It is thus located at the head of its group, after the great show of Mirza Teletovic which, with eight three-point baskets was the best of its team (29 evaluation).
The Vitoria team has been able to fill the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a large amount of commitment and collective work, even though it has had to wait to the end to win the victory.
Moreover, the great skill from the perimeter, with 16 baskets with three marked points, largely determines the final victory.
The game started quickly for the blues and reds, which took advantage from the beginning.
The fact that the first four baskets of the Vitoria team were marked from the perimeter, suggested that they had jumped on the Israeli field with their hot wrists.
English and Teletovic were the leading artisans of the 18-20 final of the first quarter.
The second quarter was on the same tone, but Alava's team chose Barac's inner game and Eliyau's work, which was received by applause and applause back to his old home, to increase their advantage at the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already beginning to notice himself as the best player of his team, with 13 marked points, although Splitter's "less six" evaluation was already suggesting that this night was not going to be the best of the Brazilian.
But in this game, despite the fact that they were on the right track at the break, nothing was played, far from there, and the Avala team wanted to remind Vitoria's team that they didn't win so easily on their ground, and thanks to "Elias's hand," they managed to get into the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the yellow taking advantage of the light (50-49).
Other difficulties
Ivanovic's players, injured but far from being killed, needed to link some skilled actions to get air, and that's when Mirza Teletovic's machine gun emerged, which, with three baskets at three consecutive points and the help of English and Ribas returned the counter to a reassuring score (54-67), and the premises succeeded in emphasizing at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
Avala's team went out to play everything for the last period and English and San Emetrio (60-75) advised that they were not going to let anyone take what they deserved during the first thirty minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini y Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign and tried to support her from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for faults, Ivanovic's players did not rush, defend well, and although the Israelis had approached at the last minute (80-85), the game had already been played and the victory had escaped Tel Aviv for the first time of the season.
Injuries prevent Unicaja from delivering battle
The Unicaja lost sharply in Greece against the Olympiacos and gave him the head of Group B of the Euro league, during a game marked by the absence of players from the Unicaja, especially in the inner game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team was not frightened by the atmosphere of the Peace and Friendship Pavilion nor by the size of the rival, probably one of the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The game of the first quarter allowed the Andalusians to dream. An aggressive defense and three baskets at three consecutive points, two of the Omar Cook and one of Guillem Rubio who dazzled the local team 12-18, at the ninth minute.
The Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the arsenal of the local team with the inner game of Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, allowed the 22-20 score to be reversed at the thirteenth minute, when an action, a beginning to fight, between North American drivers Beverley and Williams led to the disqualification of the two players.
The Greek team began to function by demonstrating its superiority in both camps, while the exit for injury of the English pivot Joel Freeland and the three personal faults of Carlos Jiménez weighed on Unicaja.
The domestic players and the Lithuanian wing Linas Kleizas, with their three-point baskets, dug the 44-32 advantage at the nineteenth minute.
An impossible climb
The third period was particularly offensive for the Olympiacos, who, despite the 19 losses, showed superior and even managed to equal the difference of the meeting at Malaga 66-48, at the twenty-seventh minute, leading the group.
Unicaja was trying to overcome the absences and the last exit of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the meeting.
Despite all these problems, Unicaja, thanks to its organization, the three-point baskets of Cook, and Lewis' support, left some hope with 66-57, at the thirty-first minute.
But victory was practically impossible because the Olympiacos proved implacable when players pressed and showed their superiority in centimeters in the area.
Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic was able to score back to 81-62 at thirty-seventh minute, and Unicaja submitted, accepting the victory of the Olympiacos.
How much should you be paid according to your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they would deserve according to their profile, thanks to a new application of Trovit, the search engine with the largest number of small real estate, employment and vehicles ads in Spain.
The "How much should you be paid?" tool calculates users' salaries from over 140,000 job offers found in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where you have to register your profession, years of experience, age and city where you want to work.
Since the application worked for a week, the search engine has generally found that the Spanish worker "feels poorly paid," explained in a statement the product manager of Trovit, Albert Ribera.
According to data available to Trovità from its search engines in the United Kingdom and France, Spanish people are the least well paid.
A British computer programmer receives 45,226 euros gross annually and one French, 31,059, while one Spanish receives 24,000 euros.
Similarly, a driver receives 34 247 euros gross annually in England, 25 751 in France and 16 420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the least well-paid work in Spain is that of a server, with EUR 11,592 net annual, followed by the seller, with EUR 14,725, and the worker, with EUR 15,667.
The most popular Internet jobs over the past three months are drivers, mid-term jobs and social workers.
Brazil sets a date for departure from Zelaya
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya's stay in his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The overthrown President will have to abandon the diplomatic law no later than 27 January 2010, the date of the official termination of his term of office.
Francisco Catunda, head of business of the Brazilian Embassy in the capital of Honduras, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he must leave the embassy, where he has been a refugee since September 21, before that date.
"He is aware that he must leave on January 27, following his mandate, he must seek another destination."
The chain also cited the former agent, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the end of the deadline: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," said Zelaya by telephone.
After the elections of 29 November (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Embassy of Brazil until January.
However, the same week, he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation finally failed, since Zelaya refused the condition of political exile that he intended to impose on him the government actually presided over by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much.
After pink days since last spring, during which the inflation of assets constituted the dominant mark on the markets, uncertainty arose again, which is not surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment where agents make decisions about a future by uncertain nature.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilise markets has been to monetaryize debt by the purchase of assets directly and indirectly by providing liquidity at close rates of zero, so that financial institutions purchase assets to be mobilised.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases have been almost completed and, without jeopardising their non-conformist liquidity policy, they are starting to put some sand in the wheels, as the ECB has done, with their award at one year next week.
As a result, investors doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain an economic recovery without heterodox measures and we are assisting in a reversal of risk premiums.
The volatility of scholarships and differences in corporate obligations are increasing again, although they remain very far from the paranormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialize private risk and public debt was again affected.
There is once again a flight to quality and the United States, Japan and Germany have been the refuges chosen by investors, leading to an increase in differences between the euro area countries and Germany.
Spain was barely affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor's threatened a further revision of the lower qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a little uncertainty is not wrong to silence moral-risk defenders, who were once again trying to provoke a case of conscience among those responsible for global economic policy who had curbed the destructive effects of the limitation of credit on the destruction of employment, while what should be done is to decree a new day of Thanksgiving.
However, the situation in Dubai resembles a tribal struggle between the emirs to restore its place to power in the Emirates and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that conceals a public deficit, elections, and a new government that discovers the pink pot.
I made it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It would be totally unreasonable for the Ecofin to save Hungary from non-compliance with its external payments at the beginning of the year and allow a member country in the euro area not to comply with its commitments.
What is logical, however, is that the Ecofin has encouraged the Greek government to transparency and makes its citizens responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we are faced with an episode of normalisation of transitional risk premiums, after a few excesses in high positions, this would be predictable.
In the Spanish case, as long as our differences in public debt are increasing as European business obligations are, we do not have to worry.
If European disparities were to decline and our differences continued to increase, then this would be a Spanish idiosyncrasy risk.
The Standard & Poor's case is an anecdote. When our forecast indicators require most of the study services to anticipate their relaunch models and to review their forecasts for 2011, with the OECD and the European Commission, which are responsible with a Japanese model for the Spanish economy, it does not much hope for their warning.
Again, this seems to be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, even though for the time being "cautious is a mother of certainty".
Connected sectors
The President of Iberdola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to speak yesterday before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies, where Spain's energy strategy is discussed these days for the next two decades.
After his speech, which was followed by that of the President of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr. Galán sketched for the press what he had referred to before the subcommittee, at eight closes.
For the President of Iberdola, Spain needs to invest EUR 50 billion until 2020 and EUR 60,000 million between this date and 2030, if nuclear power plants are to remain open today.
If this is not the case, the necessary investments would not amount to 60,000 million but to 95,000.
On the other hand, Iberdola believes that for the next decade, investments should not be devoted to increasing production capacity, but to distribution networks and international interconnections.
From 2020 onwards, the issue changes, and power will need to be increased.
Its bet focuses on both gas and coal power plants, with mechanisms for recovering carbon dioxide and, above all, on renewable energy.
In this area, it considers that 18,000 MW more are needed, with other "support energies".
Galán, who believes that the proposed Sustainable Economy Act that the government has just approved is in line with what his company claims, did not wish to attack the Royal Decree to encourage the consumption of national coal, which contradicts climate warming policies.
According to him, there is "a clear long-term bet" in this sense, despite the "pointual" measures, as the President of Iberdola called them.
In any event, Galán believes that the decisions to invest, although they are in the long term, must begin to be made, because they take some time before reaching their maturity and that a stable remuneration framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial wins the Aer Lingus handling market in ten airports
Swissport, subsidiary of Ferrovial for ground airport services , will play the preferred partner role of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for freight services at ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important.
The agreement, whose economic terms have not been revealed, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Castilla-La Mancha Board and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a collaborative protocol yesterday to establish the Smart Infrastructure Innovation Centre.
The alliance provides for an investment of 20 million up to 2012, of which 50% will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be to carry out research on energy efficiency at motorways and airports.
Protesting its first motorway in Australia in Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for her first concession highway in Australia, a market on which she already works as an energy company and water manager.
The site at stake is an estimated $1,700 million tunnel (approximately €1,047 million).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its rivals.
A five-kilometre tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, is the option to allow Acciona to settle in the country as a public works company and a highway concessionaire.
The mayor of the city wishes to have it available by the end of 2014.
After choosing public/private collaboration (PPP for its initials in English) to complete the project, within the framework of a business plan under the supervision of Ernst & Young, the local administration already has a list of finalists who will be responsible for the construction and operation of the toll.
Pending submission of their bids in May, the planned investment amounts to $1,700 million (about €1,047 million) and in the last phase there are three consortia, with a significant presence of European manufacturers.
The group named Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company in progress, and its associates are BMD and Ghalla.
The first one is one of the largest Australian manufacturers, while the second one, installed in Italy, is one of the largest European underground workers.
Against the Acona team, the Northern Direct consortium was built, with the presence of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield Infrastructure Manager and the French manufacturer Bouygues group.
The third and last consortium that passed the test is LBRJV, whose capital is divided between Australian Leighton (subsidiary of the German manufacturer Hochtief, who in turn has the participation of ACS), another local company, Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the Welsh company specializing in public works, Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large yards and privatizations, but entering them is a major challenge, except through the acquisition of a local construction company.
A strategy followed by Hochtief and Bilbao companies, already mentioned, in addition to their Asian references, which remains an invalid stage for the Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS has just won a place in this market by its 30% shareholding in Hochtief, owner of Leighton.
Assets
Actiona focused on a geographical area of greatest importance for the sector, where it already has a wide presence through its energy supplier activity and in the desalination sector.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind farms, Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and directs the grouping of companies responsible for setting up and managing the Adelaide desalination plant, with a budget of 700 million.
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and take advantage of synergies to enter the construction and infrastructure management markets.
The underground tollway, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and Northern Link (northern link), is called to connect the western highway of Toowong to the peripheral road to Kelvin Grove (see map), by 4 kilometres of tunnel. It is the largest existing project to reduce traffic congestion in Brisbane.
The schedule set by the administration indicates that the award will take place during the summer of 2010 and that the work will begin in December of next year.
Despite the fact that this toll will be open to traffic at the end of 2014, it is not expected that the site will be completed by 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include two-fold tracks, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland Government will provide US$500 million ($308 million) for its funding.
Brisbane already offers work in Hochtief
Australia continues to make Hochtief a significant success, which yesterday mentioned the acquisition of a contract with the government valued at $154 million.
The company owned by ACS will equip, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the infrastructure of the national high-speed fibre optic network.
This intervention will allow 400,000 people to have quick access to the Internet and will provide work to the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company gave way to the 27-storey King George Tower construction project in the city of Brisbane. The work has not yet begun and Hochtief concluded the sale for 129 million.
In the United Kingdom, specifically in Manchester, she will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and management of two school groups for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC is awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
The FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, is awarded the construction of a 2.1 km long tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia for an amount of €64.5 million.
The company obtained this contract a few days after having seen the expansion of the Bosruck tunnel, Austria, for a sum of 130 million.
Alpine thus consolidates its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The start of the construction project is scheduled for early 2010 and will take 32 months to complete.
Ms. Rushmore will bid Renfe advertising
Renfe has entrusted advertising and marketing services for the next two years to Mrs Rushmore, for a budget of approximately EUR 3 million per year, indicated the railway operator.
The contract mentions the possibility of two 12-month extensions each. Ms. Rushmore was selected from among 16 agencies that have submitted themselves to the tenders organized by Renfe, including four finalists, including TBWA, who has been responsible for creativity over the past three years.
From now on, Mrs. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of campaigns.
A fine of 63 million in France Télécom to curb competition
The French competition regulator imposed a fine of EUR 63 million in France Télécom for its anticompetitive conduct in the Caribbean region of the country.
According to this institution, the operator limited competition on fixed and mobile telephone by signing exclusive agreements, by tariffs and by consumer loyalty programmes outside the regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned, has accumulated more than EUR 450 million in fines since 1994, due to the obstacles it poses to its competitors.
The sanction imposed yesterday was also increased because the competition authority considers France Télécom to have committed similar offences in the past and is therefore re-offending.
An app store
On the other hand, the French company's mobile telephony subsidiary followed the advice of other operators and opened an Internet app store, with the aim of increasing revenue that does not come from voice transmission.
Initially, the Orange app shop will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
It will be necessary to wait for 2010 to arrive in other countries such as Spain.
Their participation in the Champions League has brought 4764 million to Real Madrid and Barça since its inception
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since its birth in 1992.
Indeed, Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona won 467.4 million, which places them in third and fifth positions of the clubs that have invested the most money in this competition.
Manchester United is at the top of the list.
Manchester United is at the top of the list.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only brings glory, but it is also one of the main sources of income of the major clubs.
The competition distributed EUR 5 362.5 million to 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) who participated in the event since the tournament was set up during the 1992-1993 season, according to UEFA information.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona were well served during this distribution.
The white club was the third on the continent to pay the most for its participation, and the only one, with the A.C. Milan, won the trophy three times.
The Catalan club, currently holding the title and last winner of the former European Cup in 1992, is fifth on the list.
At the top of the list are Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams who also made the most money for their participation in the last Champions League.
And that, though they lost in front of the Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country, with regard to the money reported by the Champions League, although it has won more titles than any other (five, while Italy has won four, England three and Germany two).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex process of distribution of money applied by UEFA.
For this year, the organization chaired by Michel Platini plans to earn 1,090 million thanks to the Champions League.
Out of this amount, UEFA will devote 413.1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the classification games (including the Atletico de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
Furthermore, those who were able to participate received only 3.8 million to be there, in addition to 550 00 euros for each match.
There is also a winning bonus (800,000 euros) and equality bonus (400,000 for each team). Those arriving in eighth final receive three million each, the eight teams arriving in quarter final receive 3.3 million.
The last four teams will each receive 4 million.
And the champion will win 9 million, compared to the 5.2 received by the other finalist.
For example, for fixed payments, a club will earn at least 7.1 million and no more than 31.2 million.
On the other hand, the Barça won 2.5 million for winning the Super Cup of Europe in August.
But in addition, there are variable payments, to which 337.8 million are devoted.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish market is one of the most important, and has four attractive places.
The previous year's champion accounted for 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other part will be paid based on the number of games played during the current year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers €61 million for 29.9% of Sos.
The Nueva Rumasa group listed yesterday the details of the offer to purchase shares by which it intends to acquire a maximum of 25 to 29.9 % of Sos' capital.
A percentage that does not require it to launch a public procurement offer (OPA) for all securities.
In concrete terms, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1.5025 per share, which will be paid in 10 years and will be paid at a rate of 1% per year for this deferral.
Yesterday, Sos' shares ended at EUR 1.85; Nueva Rumasa's offer therefore assesses the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of EUR 1.50 reflects the actual assessment of Sos.
The offer is conditioned by the appointment of eight of the 15 advisers.
The Jerez group gives a 15-day deadline for shareholders to indicate their interest in selling securities.
The CNMV assured that it was not informed of this offer, although the Ruiz Mateos company claimed that it had contacted the regulator.
If it were to take place, the disbursement would amount to 611.7 million, while the capital of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues the restructuring of his management.
In an attempt to remain outside of possible offers of purchase and come and come judicial of its former directors, the brothers Jesus and Jaime Salazar, she announced the election of María Luis Jordá as director of internal audit.
A decision that makes it the first woman to hold a leading position in the food business.
This is a newly created post that will depend directly on the group president.
And it is not without controversy, since the company remains immersed in the legal battle for the alleged diversion of more than 230 million Sos to Salazar companies.
Moreover, the possibility that in the coming months Sos reveals new diversions of funds cannot be ruled out.
With regard to credit to Salazar, former advisors Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) said yesterday before the National Audience that they had been informed of the diversion of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV authorizes Paternina's exclusion OPA presented by Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (NCMV) authorized yesterday the exclusion OPA presented by Inversora Mer on Federico Paternina on 9 October last.
The monitoring body explained that it authorized this operation because it understood that its terms were consistent with the existing standards and considered "sufficient" the content of the explanatory sheet presented, as amended on December 2.
The CNMV stated that the offer concerns the acquisition of 550 008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, representing 8.95% of the share capital, consisting of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading on the grants of Madrid and Bilbao.
He further explained that 5,592,778 million shares had been fixed and that they could in no way be transmitted prior to the completion of the offer, which he indicated that the price had been fixed by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the provisions of the existing standards.
New tools for car expertise
In these days of bad weather and accidents, car garages are not the only winners.
Every day, thousands of cars that have suffered a disaster are brought back to a garage, where an expert must assess the damage suffered and the cost of repair.
Each disaster is different, and the calculation of the cost of parts and working time can be a long and complex work.
Calculate by hand the cost of a repair of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including parts and the labour force can take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the assistance of the most recent computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
That is why almost 100% of experts use such systems.
Providers of services and solutions for the assessment of claims and maintenance are dedicated to collecting information provided by manufacturers, then treating and offering them to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the North American Solara group, is the leading company; 80% of the estimates are made with its products.
Other companies competing in the field of sector assessment and information development tools are GtMotive and Eurotax.
The work with the data provided by the manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, the company in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to increase, so that in the last five years more versions, variants and motorizations have been launched than in the previous fifteen years.
When a new car comes out of the market, these companies get to work.
This is a very hard job, because we need to catalogue each of the thousand parts of the vehicle and record its price.
In addition, a "intelligent" graphic image of each model on which you can click on the different parts of a tourist car is created.
If this is a model sold massively, work can be ready in a week if the process moves very quickly.
In the case of an unsold car, it may take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has full information of 99.2% of cars marketed in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models, they have, for example, information on the Porsches, but not the Ferraris or Lamborghini.
With regard to vehicles in circulation, the figure exceeds 99%.
To carry out the work of documentation and database development, Audatex has eight centres throughout the world (in Spain, France, Germany, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan, and each of them specializes in some brands.
The national seat is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than one hundred technicians (usually mechanical experts) work simultaneously on three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million annually to develop these databases.
Each month, 2.5 million data are recorded, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this huge flow of information allows these companies to use different uses and to offer various products.
The most common application concerns repair and maintenance, but depending on the countries, there are also tools for managing the caskets or for calculating the venal or residual value of a car.
The only company with a guide to the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not propose it in our country, but it does it in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support it can provide to professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, the flagship product being AudaPlus, the standard disaster assessment solution for experts.
These include cars, motorcycles, light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it takes into account the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the paint scales.
This tool is purchased according to its use, for each estimate.
The highest cost is EUR 5.75, for customers who use it little, not more than ten times a month.
Then, each insurance company, which performs thousands of expertise, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the full identification of a vehicle and equipment with which it came out of the assembly chain, only thanks to its chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle lenses, and Auda Subastas is an open server to the professional sector on the Internet that allows you to invest in declared vehicles that are damaged.
Its statistical service is very useful to identify trends, perform geo-demographic analyses or know the current problems by brand or model.
It is possible to study, for example, how many models of a particular brand went to the garage for a failure or how many severe accidents occurred for a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of such tools.
It markets, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and provides digital images, as well as access to the official parts, prices and time of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa group, founded in 1971, as a provider of services and solutions for assessing car accidents, crashes or maintenance.
The evaluation guide is a historical reference product on the market.
The company works with 24,000 users in garages, 3 100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its turnover has increased by 20% per year over the last three years, and it made a turnover of EUR 10.8 million in 2008.
At the beginning of last year, she began her internationalization process, with the establishment of an office in Paris.
For his part, Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and settled in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its turnover is made in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. It works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 garages, of which 3,000 are in Spain.
The global turnover of the Solera group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informax ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will be $557 million, 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country, the company will receive €19.1 million, or 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, the Solara Group was listed $1,000 million in stock exchange, today its shares are valued at a total of $2,400 million.
Since 2007, it has been next to the New York Stock Exchange and is part of the Standard & Poor's Reference Index.
Internet auctions of accidental cars
Last October, the Solara group purchased Autoonline, an Internet platform for the sale of cars, motorcycles and special vehicles damaged.
The transaction involved a cost of EUR 59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could extend next year to the remaining 15%.
The objective of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of access to a vast international market.
This estimation and sales service is intended exclusively for professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, garages, cashiers and professional sellers who must be registered before beginning operations.
This platform was established in Germany in 1996 and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, including 500,000 in Germany.
Its main markets include Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
There are currently more than 1500 vendors and 4,000 experts registered on the site.
It manages 3,000 ads per day and on the Spanish market, 100 new ads are published every day.
In accordance with Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been removed can no longer drive, but on the other hand, certain parts that are not damaged can be used as spare parts.
Collection cars can be reregistered, although they have been removed, after complex procedures.
Four-step garage quote
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex ensures that the user gets a quote in only four steps: identify the vehicle, search the spare part, create a currency and generate it.
The ease of use is an essential element of these systems, especially to convince older professionals who, to a greater or lesser extent, are resistant to the use of new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, including 666 tourism, 109 all-terrain, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Naturally, to use it, a computer and an Internet connection are required.
Once the model to be repaired is identified with its chassis number, a real graphic image of the model in question appears and then the necessary part is selected.
The user can include variables such as the labour price, increases or reductions, and then can print the quote to give it back to the customer.
AudaTaller is not an estimate tool like AudaPlus, but a reference catalogue.
The main difference between these two systems is that the one intended for garages does not include estimated labour times.
The cost of using this tool for the garage is EUR 350 per year, which may be credited.
Currently, the Audatex company is working to make these images three dimensions.
This is an innovation that mechanics see as a very good eye, as it will allow, for example, to select a door and turn it around to see the inner face.
