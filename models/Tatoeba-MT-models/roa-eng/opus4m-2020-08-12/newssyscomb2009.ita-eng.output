The triumph of right-wing populists in Austria: in total they have 29%
The noticeable weakening of both parties in the great coalition and this marked strengthening of the right-wing populist parties led, according to the first provisional results, to the early parliamentary elections of Sunday in Austria.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), within which the current President Wilhelm Molterer's position is seriously wavering, has suffered particularly severe losses.
On the contrary, the electoral leader of the Union for the future of Austria (BZÖ), the subprefect of Kärnten Jörg Haider, is preparing for the triumphal return to national policy.
According to the provisional results, the country's strongest party remains the socio-democratic party (SPÖ) with 29.8% of the votes, compared to the last elections in 2006 however it loses 5.5%.
Even worse went to ÖVP, which loses by 25.6% almost 9% of the votes.
These are the worst results of these two great parties in the Austrian postwar history and above all the literally catastrophic result of the people, which led to early elections.
Even at the beginning of July, when ÖVP abandoned the coalition, the people had a great advantage in front of SPÖ.
But the voters obviously punished them for causing the government to sink.
In the first reactions to the results there were speculations about the possible resignations of the party president, Vice Chancellor Wilhelm Monterer.
Observers believe that they could already happen on Monday during the extraordinary convening of the Party's leadership.
This development should perhaps facilitate the path towards the increasingly probable way out of the electoral result, i.e. towards the renewal of the SPÖ and ÖVP coalition.
With regard to the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties -the liberals (FPÖ) have earned 18% in advance and the BZÖ 11% in votes - but the socio-democratics have simultaneously revealed the concern of another 1999, when the populists have agreed with the people to the collective government, (then the FPÖ was still united, in 2005 it was separated from the BZÖ) which has even been the cause of sanctions on the part of the European Union.
On this evolution obviously plays Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to collaborate with any party and assumes a return to Vienna in national politics.
The Green Party has also been able to enter Parliament, but it has fallen slightly, from the third to fifth place among the Austrian political parties.
No other party has obviously exceeded the threshold of 4% and has not entered Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can be cooled
If the problem could not be resolved with the Czech scientists who were accused of illegal harvesting of beetles in India, the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg said that there would be some cooling of the Czech-Indian relations.
The Minister mentioned this in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranaab Mukherjee.
"If it did not resolve, then it would be a certain cooling," he noted after the meeting that took place under the Czech initiative.
Mukherjee after the negotiations said that executive power can hardly interfere with legal matters.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted by the charge and punished with a fine, the central government may negotiate with the local government in Dardjeeling which falls under its jurisdiction.
"Your problem could be resolved," said the Minister.
According to Mukherjee, it would be better, for Emil Kučera sentenced to three years in prison, to resort to a higher instance.
Then you can ask for release on bail and wait for the sentence in freedom.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner expressed himself in the same way during the negotiations.
"Recommend the appeal to the Major Court then it will be possible to obtain grace," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can enter the matter is to provide the convicted with the "competent legal support", supported the Indian Minister.
At the same time, he said that such support is already being provided by the Indian side.
"We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relations that have been with India for many years.
Indians also admit it," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as ČTK said, in front of his partner, he stressed that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We consider the detention and prosecution of these Czech scientists to be a serious mistake," he said.
The Minister has avoided answering the question if he has obtained from the Indian side the promise to deal with it.
"I've got relatively many promises," she just noticed.
A Czech judge in the battle for the seabeds
It approaches the electronic map on the wall on which Australia is drawn and adjacent marine areas.
But it is not interested in the continent but at a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and with it the adjacent seabed.
The area is at the same time as the continent itself, says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuossi, who is part of a team of 33 OSN workers for ocean issues and maritime rights.
His boss, Czech lawyer director of the Division, Václav Mikulka, is following his exhibition and occasionally adds something.
It dominates the desire to work and enthusiasm.
The seabed still hides now a little known world rich in natural resources.
It is possible to find oil, metal minerals and other mineral materials, but also known living organisms so far that carry within themselves the key to the discovery of cancer medicine.
The largest bottom of the mainland
Coastal states have begun to take an interest in submarine territory.
According to the OSN Convention, they enjoy the laws on which they made an agreement in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of the so-called continental platform which often extends up to hundreds of kilometres from the coast of the state concerned.
It has an exclusive right under the Convention over all the resources of the continental shelf.
"In a few words per continental platform is that part of seabed and its ground which is a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
The so-called exclusive economic zone extends beyond the territorial sea often over 200 nautical miles," Mikulka explains.
The request for the country to appear before the Committee on the Definition of the Dimensions of the Continental Shelf must be accompanied by a very broad technical-scientific documentation based on many expensive surveys and measurements.
It is the result of a preparation of many years.
"One of our tasks is to provide the Commission with legal and technical-professional assistance.
The committee has so far dealt with 5 requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the last three nominees have succeeded," adds Mikulka.
The recent success of Australia which has greatly expanded its marine possessions has recorded a global echo.
But New Zealand also earned us - the surface of the seabed, which was assigned to you by the commission last week, about 1.6 square kilometers so about six times larger than the state itself.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
The profit, which will bear fruit in the future from the seabeds, as promised will be invaluable.
Other states will gradually submit their requests.
They can do so for ten years since "the Montego Bay Convention" has been ratified.
At the end of the continental shelf begins the area of the bottom of the ocean that the Convention has declared a common heritage of humanity."
No one has an exclusive position right now.
The right of extraction in this area shall be granted by this international institution established by the Convention.
"But the Seabed is not Klondike", says exaggerating Director Mikulka," with the fact that its individual parties are legally demarcated and their contractually established regime."
Czechs in the Pacific
A part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic today.
If it divides it with other states of the former Soviet bloc within the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
This acquired in 1991 according to the Convention, as well as investors from a few other states, the status of so-called "pioneer investor".
He has the right of extraction in the ClarionClipperton area in the extended Pacific Ocean between Mexico, Hawaii Islands and Kiribati.
The area explored by the investor and slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is crushed, it's almost an underwater replica of Tatry.
"It is possible to extract on the total area of 75 000 square kilometres.
The area is a rich deposit of polymetallic agglomerates containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," explains another Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A worker from the division of Macedonia Rober Sandev brings with him a find to show it.
It looks like a little potato or with a little fantasy, a legendary scheme, as in the legend of the awakening of Golem.
German special units were present for the release of hostages
The Egyptian government had asked Germany for help in releasing the hostages – the experts then arrived.
When the situation became critical, special units were ready, but they did not intervene.
We are getting more and more detailed information on the circumstances of the release of the 11 European hostages.
On the rescue operation mentioned by the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior there were special German units.
In addition to the army specialists there were the GSG9 units, the federal avian police, the federal criminal office as well as the logistics experts of the technical institution.
As the spokesperson for ministers reported on Monday evening, German units did not intervene because the kidnappers, given the danger of force intervention, have released the hostages by fleeing.
The Egyptian government has accepted the aid offered by the Germans, to join as assistance directly on the spot.
"We didn't get lucky," says a spokesperson from the interior ministry.
Aggressors kidnapped a group of travellers in southern Egypt on 19 September: 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian companions.
After kidnapping in a desert area in southern Egypt, the hostages were deported to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers to the end was kept secret as well as the details of the release or possible redemption payments.
The released in the meantime have arrived in good condition in Cairo.
Steinmeier said that the hostages released are under the protection of the German embassy.
The details of the release were not explained.
There was no information in Berlin when they would return to Germany.
According to the newspaper "Bild" the 5 vacationers and special units should fly with an Airbus of the military aircraft and arrive Tuesday in Germany.
American representative chamber rejects the rescue package.
The first chamber of the American Congress just failed the $700 billion rescue package for the financial markets.
Dow Jones fell downstairs.
With 206 entries around 227 the American representative house rejected the government's rescue package for financial markets.
Despite the appeals of American President George W. Bush and leading politicians of both parties there was no majority for the programme, with which the chaos of the financial markets should have been eliminated.
In a dramatic action the supporters have tried desperately to persuade critics from the heavy pack of $700 billion.
Barney Frank, one of the leaders of the negotiations, encouraged Members to agree, even if the plan was unpopular.
8. It is difficult to have gratitude to avoid something, which has not yet arrived..
While the Dow Jones suffrage was ongoing, it collapsed more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The reason for investors' concerns was that the state rescue package could have failed.
It took place before the end of the vote and then, after the announcement of failure, collapsed again.
Experts now expect further serious turbulence on international financial markets.
In order to ensure that the programme enters into force it is necessary to have the benefit of both the Chamber of Members and the Senate.
Proponents record rising booking figures
It seems that it will be a good winter for German tourists:
According to one study, the turnover on travel bookings for the next few months compared to the previous year has clearly increased - for the winter season even more than 30%.
Despite weak views of the situation, the desire to travel Germans still remains sound.
On the winter season reservations, travel agencies recorded a plus of 31 % turnover compared to the same period of the previous year, as the German association for DRV tourism reported in Berlin on Monday.
According to the GfK Market Research Institute survey, there are also increased booking shares for the autumn months.
So the excess of travel agencies for October compared to 2007 would amount to approximately 11%, said the DRV.
Assumed for these results are the GfK figures, which monthly analyses the booking data of 1200 German travel agencies and develops statistical projections for the entire market.
Included would also be travel bookings made until the end of August 2008.
As a result of the weak dollar quote, requested in particular would be travel to the United States, the DRV reported.
Here the increase in reservations would amount to about a third.
In addition, travel destinations would be particularly requested in the Germans, Spain, Turkey, Greece, as well as in-house locations in Germany.
Especially all inclusive trips have a high quote, explained the president of DRV Klaus Laepple.
Considering the rising costs for energy and food, the costs in this case would be "better to calculate for customers than for an individually organised holiday".
Consumers could save money through, among others, discounts for reservations made in advance or offers with everything included, Laepple explained.
Even the summer months would have recorded excellent booking figures, so much so that compared to the year before there would have been a surplus of turnover again - even if according to a further study the number of Germans who undertook a trip, compared to the previous year has fallen.
My first time at the Oktoberfest
Hits of Ballermann, mouth beer from a liter and vip in Dirndln griffati.
A debut at the Wiesn
Susanne Kronzucker and I do not really have much in common.
She is blonde, television moderator and wears a tailored Dirndl.
I have dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is second-hand.
But one thing goes hand in hand: just 3 minutes at the Wiesn, photographers are already shooting at us and taking photos until they fill the memory of the cameras – very flattering, and this on my first visit to the Wiesn.
That's how you make friends
The Dirndl with two money seems to have achieved its purpose.
As a tourist of the Wiesn and actually resident north of the white sausage equator, the sense of well-being in the costume/cloth so far remains within limits.
And then once you get to Theresienwiese, it's nothing serious.
Almost everyone wears the Dirndl or leather pants; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed – everything perfectly normal.
Only my Dirndl's ankle collects strange eyes at the banana stand at chocolate.
A monk points out that I would have tied the apron wrongly: "On the left you are free, on the center six virgins, on the right you are engaged, behind the widow."
All of a sudden I fix my bow from behind to left.
All right," he says and laughs.
Others make less waste of subtle flirt techniques and wear super felt hats, on which cape "To drop to get dressed!" and stretch their bare back against an uninvited one.
The guy with exhibitionist inclinations is called Bob, comes from England and also visits the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a twisted "oooooo.".
This tells me, after he got rid of his beer mouth from a liter drunk before.
Right next to one of these hydrants, of which everyone thinks it's a bowler.
Bob is one of these famous "Wildbiesler".
Others are not lucky to get rid of alcohol this way.
Around 8 p.m. they walk in white on the plaza of the feast the health care workers, who must take care of the poor beoni
The nurses appear every time in white – always 4 at the same time drag a tent-covered deck into the tent.
This works as with most visitors of the Wiesn: it goes empty, it returns full.
Who lies under the tellon in this alcoholic pool in the blood, you can't see.
"Des sind die, wos goarnimmer packn," one of the healthists screams at me and disappears in the baronda.
Victim of an accident identified by the police
A 63-year-old woman who died in a hospital after being invested by a vehicle while walking to Essex was identified.
Carole Paulson from Chelmsford Road in Brentwood was involved in the Friday afternoon incident on Shenfield Road in town.
She was taken to the Queen's Hospital in Romford, but she died shortly thereafter.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested with the false driving charge.
He was released on bail.
Turkey is expanding diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey tried to enter the European Union, the European powers were anxious to penetrate the Turkish hinterland.
On the eastern part of the Bosphorus, perhaps 20 steps in Asia, is one of the most beautiful relics of this failed imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in neo-renaissance style.
This is at least what tourist guides tell you.
The building stands on horseback between the end of the platforms with a tower on each of its corners looking around the world like some German provincial municipalities.
The stone is dirty.
The entire building is slightly decadent.
But once inside the ticket office from the ceiling at a time, there is no doubt about the size of the enterprise of what was the most western passage.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a delay in imperial play, wanted to realize its ambitions to dominate the Middle East through this railway that ran to Damascus, Baghdad and beyond what Saudi Arabia is today.
But Germany's imperial ambitions sank during the first world war.
His railroads were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
Its isolation from the surrounding region, generated by the frozen borders of the cold war, has passed
British and dominant forces advanced out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And there was some bad news about Hyderpasha station.
In 1917 a munitions train broke out destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then he has been slowly decommissioned, largely surpassed by history.
But today, this railway outlet for Anatolia and all the points to the east, are needed - at least symbolically - to highlight the increasingly larger diplomatic horizons of Turkey.
The ruling party of Justice and Development - the AKP - has created a whole new foreign policy for the country.
Its isolation from its surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the cold war, has passed.
There is now a new commitment policy.
The Turkish Government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To estimate the parameters of this new foreign policy, I embarked on the carriage bed for the Turkish capital Ankara, to visit one of the AKP's leading foreign policy experts, Turkish deputy Suat Kinikilioglu.
The following morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a run to the tracks that produced the ancient world cadences of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital - proposed as a new city for a secular state intended to turn its back to its Ottoman past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamic roots represents an exemplary movement in the Turkish consensus.
He suggested some suspicions in the West, most notably in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the headquarters of the AKP, an ultra-modern structure of stone and steel - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by built media shopping centers and power pastries, where managers in complete business - both men and women - meet to make early morning contracts.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a centre-right politician from almost every other political party in Europe.
Complete, tie, I'm sure he had a Blackberry.
"The purpose of the foreign policy party now is to reintegrate Turkey with its closest neighbours.
Cold war was an anomaly," he tells me.
Turkey has been cut off from its interior.
Today you have to look east and west at the same time.
It wasn't the case with each other.
They must be both.
"But surely at some point, "I ask, "Will Turkey be forced to decide?"
"Turkey," he says, "he doesn't want to face that choice."
Then he points out a point that almost all those I have spoken to here have recited in memory: the links of not only to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus, and all around the Black Sea, are of benefit to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, Europe as a whole can metaphorically navigate those railway lines east through Asia and the Middle East.
Again at Hydarpasha station, after another night in white, I think of those two German gentiles Herr Ritter and Herr Conu who had looked at this building built 100 years ago.
How surprised they would be to find that the Middle East ambitions of Europe can now largely be in the hands of Turkey.
And while I wait at the ferry terminal that takes me back through the Bosphorus, I remember that those days Turkey has always been called "the sick man of Europe".
At least there seemed to be no doubt as to which continent to move forward on this fascinating country.
Remember: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: as musical director of Guildford since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (necrologist, September 11th) had the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the choir.
As a member of his scheme of music for the municipality, the following year he founded his wonderful youth choir, Proteus.
It was supposed that they were under-21s, but at the time when Proteus sang his final in 1979, many of us were more than twenty years - we simply refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological being-changeable) represented the good will of the choir and the ability to deal with everything that music presented to do, both Madrid and Messiaen, without accompaniment or with the whole orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often amazing, always exciting, and it was all because of the inspiration of that man and the enthusiasm for the music that remained absolutely constant throughout the years.
How often Tod told us to "let music be speaking for itself".
He said, "The composer knows what he wants.
There's everything there, in the music.
So sing it!"
His technique in the use of the stick was absolutely clear and precise, although never dictatorial or flowery.
Whatever the musical standard was, it made it ever higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If you were to appoint a conductor, it would have been Vernon Handley.
I knew him very well during the two decades he drove Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past 40 years and more I have covered more than 100 of his concerts and I can honestly say that I have never disagreed with one of them - and many times inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of personal size and modesty.
He hated the conductors of the orchestra who, in his words, simply "wrestled around the world one or two well-known battle horses".
He'll miss so many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary of William Woodruff (September 25th) specifies that "in 1946 he resumed studying economic history in Oxford and in 1950 he became a researcher in Houblon-Norman... while studying for a degree in science, one in letters and a PhD".
This results from Woodruff's note in Beyond Nab End, but is not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a university professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, during that period he completed a PhD thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J. D. Chambers, and later published in 1958 as The British Rubber Industry.
He spent 1950-51 in the USA as a researcher in Houblon-Norman, and the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham permanently for Illinois.
Because Woodruff chose to cover this part of his career, you don't know.
J. Vincent Resino at the Faculty of Philology
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino "Flamenco y vida", because his photographs in black and white, in documentary style, are extraordinary.
They have drawn my attention to the simplicity and strength they transmit, although they treat the protagonists with particular respect.
An exhibition that conveys a lot of feeling.
Resin is able to capture magical moments."
Second Assault for Honda Supersales
In November the Honda will start the marketing of the second generation of the Jazz model.
If the previous model was already equipped with great habitability, this new monovolume has an even wider internal space.
In addition to everything, a refined mechanics, which increases driving comfort and allows to save fuel.
Evolution against revolution.
This is the second generation of the Jazz Wave.
Although aesthetically the new Jazz has a line very similar to that of the previous model, the changes in this monovolume are numerous.
Among others, it is worth reporting an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
However, before going to analyze the new model, it is useful to note that this new Jazz arrives six years after entering the first generation market.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda renewed this model in a shorter time than those used by other producers.
Although in Europe the Jazz model is less known than in other markets, it remains a unique phenomenon in terms of sales.
This is exactly the case of Japan, where Jazz was the most sold car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
In Japan almost a million Jazz units were sold since the launch.
The second market was that of the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
Despite these numbers, Honda believes that the new Jazz will allow for increased sales in the segment.
Thus, if in 2007 the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 units of this model, for 2009 estimates are around 100,000 cars, assuming a 17% increase in sales in the European market.
As regards the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, accounting for 6.7% of total Honda sales in Spain.
As for the new generation, the Spanish branch expects to sell around 2,000 Jazz units over a year.
The arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to reduce sales in Spain by a good degree.
In fact, the managers of the company plan to arrive at the end of the year with a total of 22,000 units sold, i.e. 4,000 less than in 2007, with a decrease of 16%.
Despite the increase in sales, Honda has increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8 per cent, compared with 1.6 per cent last year.
In addition, the Japanese company expects to reach 2% in 2010.
To succeed, the Honda trusts the arrival of another new model.
It is Insight, a five-door hybrid and compact format - 4.37 meters long - of which the Japanese company hopes to sell about 200,000 units a year worldwide.
For the markets and according to the estimates made by the Japanese producer, 50% of Insight's sales will take place in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be divided between the Old Continent and Japan.
Insight's commercial launch is scheduled for the first months of the year, immediately after the company's presentation in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has grown in all its parts.
Its length reaches 3.90 meters (five centimeters in excess), the width is 1.69 meters (two centimeters in excess) and the range is 2.50 meters, with an increase of five centimeters.
The height, however, remained unchanged at 1.52 meters.
Together with the increase in size, it also expands the living interior.
This advantage stems from the inclusion of a new platform, and from the introduction of the central fuel tank, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz model.
In addition, the luggage capacity – equipped with double background – rises to 399 litres, i.e. 19 litres more the capacity of the first generation.
It should be noted that these are the measurements of the 1.4 engine version, and that the capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 trunk is 379 litres.
Other improvements - in addition to external elements such as rear leds or the possibility of mounting the panoramic glass - concern an improvement in the accessibility of the rear seats.
The doors that allow access to the rear positions are opened with an angle of 80 degrees, compared to the 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
Also, the engines in this second generation of jazz are new.
At the time of marketing, this small model will be proposed in models with petrol engine of 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both mechanics include i-VTEC technology that allows to lower consumption, produce less carbon dioxide emissions, optimize mechanics and at the same time maintain high engine torque in all its phases.
The 1.2 litre model allows you to enjoy a power of 90 cv to 6,000 rpm with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 rpm.
The propulsion – which in previous Jazz reached 78 horses – uses 5.3 litres of fuel and produces CO2 emissions of about 125 grams.
Compared with the previous propulsion, which in the first generation model used 83 horses, now 100 are available.
Jazz 1.4 to 100 horses reaches a combination of 5.4 litres of fuel and 128 grams of CO2 emitted.
The "ape car" to avoid collisions
In the context of the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan inspired himself this time, to nature, and in particular to bees.
Japanese society has created a robot that, by taking the flight of bees for example, knows how to avoid accidents.
It is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, the first step towards collision prevention technologies.
The engineers of the Advanced Technical Center of Nissan Motor Co. have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Scientific and Technological Research Centre of the prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Research and Development of Brand Management, BR23C is an expansion of the Security Shield of four areas produced by Nissan.
This robot is designed to improve the ability to prevent collisions in the home vehicle.
During the flight, each api creates its own personal oval-shaped space which is very similar to the Nissan security shield.
But the most important thing is the compound eyes of the bees, able to see in all directions with a angle above 300 degrees, and allowing the insect to fly continuously in its personal space.
To recreate this visual functionality, engineers have developed what they have defined as a localization laser (Laser Range Finder).
This mechanism identifies the obstacles facing the BR23C for a radius within two meters and with a maximum width of 180 degrees, calculates the distance from the object and sends a signal to a microprocessor on board that immediately allows for prevention of collision.
"At the moment when an obstacle is detected, the little robot imitates the movements of a bee and immediately changes direction by turning on the wheels at straight angle or larger to avoid collision.
The most obvious difference with any assisted system is that the escape maneuver is totally instinctive.
"If not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, Director of the Mobility Laboratory and Chief Engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot deflect upwards or downwards, and not diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and in the direction in which they can turn its wheels and not exploit endless directions and ways as the bees do.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot can avoid collisions.
"This device only needs to process the information every few seconds, and to act on this data.
It does not require the storage of information or intuitive logic of previous maneuvers, so it can work without interruption and with only a few dozen KB of memory.
This may surprise, but we're not talking about memory gigabytes, and not even mega."
This is the first step towards the development of new technologies for the instant prevention of collisions, a technology that Nissan hopes will be serious in cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and more durable than the lithium ion typology.
Another potential future application of this technology could be the integration of the units with a GPS satellite navigation system to bring the driver to destination avoiding the obstacles present in the route.
Tremend before applying for a loan
We must recognise that the United States Treasury Department, as well as having a lot of capital to intervene, is certainly not ingenious.
Faced with the crisis and in order to prevent Americans from engaging in in insolvency bank loans, they created a fun and informative game for network users: "Bad Credit Hotel".
In other words, the "Hotel of Bad Credits"... or some problems.
The tetro aspect of this accommodation and, in particular, its receptionist serves to lead to thinking not one, but two or even three times before requesting a loan.
And, above all, where to do so, which is probably the primary objective.
Certainly the information that the game provides is useful, but it is little detailed.
It is more a page for teenagers than a website for the vast public.
What happens if you complete the game?
Well, there's a dream room in the hotel.
It's still something, because buying a better house doesn't even talk...
Morgan Stanley opens its capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the signing of an agreement with the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first bank in Japan, which will invest nine billion dollars in a share equal to 21% of participation in the Company, news received following a sharp decline in its shares in the Stock Exchange.
One week after an interim agreement was drawn up, the two banks explained that the MUFG would have purchased 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's shares at an individual cost of $25.25, i.e. a sum of three billion dollars.
The fixed price is below 19% of the accounting value of the securities as at 31 August.
The MUFG will also invest six billion dollars in the purchase of convertible securities at a conversion price of 31.25 dollars, ensuring a 10% return.
Morgan Stanley stated that the overall transaction would be based on an average price of $29 per title, i.e. a percentage less than its current course of 28%.
By 17.00 the title Morgan Stanley, however, dropped from 6.79% to 23.07 dollars.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition into bank holding company," said John Mack, director general of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which should allow her to differentiate her actions by passing them under the control of the Federal Reserve.
Its alliance with the MUFG also confirms how the current financial crisis forces Wall Street's biggest names to adopt a much more prudent attitude than previously taken.
The terms defined on Monday also show that in recent days the agreement has been modified: last Monday, Morgan had simply announced the sale of 20% of her shares to the Japanese colossus for an amount of $8.5 billion.
"A week ago, in Tokyo, Toshihide Mizuno, executive director of the MUFG, explained: "We thought that our share would consist exclusively of ordinary shares.
But given the current situation of the world economy and the market, we have chosen to minimize risks and protect ourselves."
On the basis of the weighted average price, MUFG will obtain Morgan Stanley securities at a price below their accounting value of 7%.
And the transaction would result in an investment of at least 20% of equity on a diluted basis."
The agreement provides that the MUFG will be able to convert in one year half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares if, during a given period, the latter is traded more than 50% below the fixed conversion price, i.e. around 47 dollars.
Morgan Stanley ensures that the capital provided by the MUFG would allow them to seize investment opportunities, strengthen their budget and increase their liquidity.
One spokesperson of the group, however, refused to provide details on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After the MUFG investment, Morgan Stanley should therefore establish a Tier One solvency coefficient of about 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan said that she had "clearly" lightened her budget from the end of August.
In the last few weeks, the group has been severely tested, which has seen half the value of its own shares being halved, while the cost of risk insurance has undergone a setback.
The cost of relapsing Monday, however, remains at a high level, around 12%.
Last week the Goldman Sachs, another "survivor" among the large investment banks on Wall Street after the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the Merrill Lynch, announced that he had raised $15 billion, partly at the Berkshire Hathaway, group de Warren Buffett.
Rafael Correa to Quito this Monday.
Found the republic on a socialism right in the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, of Bolivian Evo Morales et of Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
On Sunday, following the example of colleagues and friends, it was the latter that gave voice to the draft of a new Constitution.
Mission accomplished since, according to the official results, 64% of the voters voted "yes" to the referendum, based on votes of 80%.
According to these results, the "no" was 28%, while 7% of the votes were zero and 0.7% white cards.
For the draft Constitution to be adopted, half of the votes should be taken, plus one.
On Sunday, two polls carried out at the exit of the electoral seats and an estimate of a non-governmental organization had announced a overwhelming "yes" victory, placing it between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had also claimed in the night between Sunday and Monday the victory of his Constitution project.
The "Constitution has triumphed gloriously", he assured himself, congratulating Ecuadorians in the governorate of Guayaquil, 280 kilometres south-west of Quito.
As always, Chávez and Morales congratulated Rafael Correa, as did his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The poll, which took place calmly according to the election observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), was based on a text of 444 points aimed at consolidating the "new socialism" defended by the president.
This draft Constitution consecrates the power of the state over the economy, reserving to it the "development planning" of a country which lives essentially of oil extraction implemented by large foreign companies and consequently of their currency.
Designed by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also gives greater power to the Head of State, who can be elected for two consecutive four-year terms, to have the opportunity to dissolve the assembly.
Correa has already announced its intention to exploit this amendment and to propose its application for a new term in February 2009.
The Constitution also affirms the freedom of health and education services, which the President has begun to promote in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population live below the poverty line.
It also prohibits the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for US drug operations.
The 19 hostages released in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched the attack on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight escorts kidnapped ten days ago.
I'm in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts held prisoners in the desert for ten days were reported Monday afternoon, healthy and safe, in the Egyptian capital.
In the morning, they were released to Chad by an Egyptian commander.
Apparently in shape, the hostages arrived at the military base of Almaza, near the international airport of Cairo, about 15 and 30, on board a special plane.
On board a helicopter, they were transferred immediately, without being able to issue any interviews to the press, to the Maadi hospital, a residential suburb of Cairo, to be subjected to analysis.
They enjoy "good health" and no ransom has been paid "to kidnappers", said Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoeir Garanna on the runway.
Kidnapped on September 19 during a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, bordering Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been shot from one hiding place to another by 35 unknown kidnappers.
The group consisted of 11 tourists – five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian – and 8 Egyptians: two guides, four autists, one border guard and the director of Aegyptous, the organizing agency of the Safari.
An Egyptian security officer said that 30 members of the special forces, on board two helicopters, had launched the assault at night just before dawn.
"There were gunshots, half of the kidnappers were killed, while the others fled," said the manager who demanded to maintain anonymity.
He explained that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "lamp" unit were sent to Sudan, where they would have been supported by German and Italian commanders.
The Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini stressed, from Belgrade, the importance of the role of secret agents and Italian special forces.
We must admit that if we achieved this result it was thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of the men of our secret services, of the special forces," he said, without adding further details.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese patrol army had claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 vehicle on whose board were the kidnappers and killed six of them, including the Chadian leader of the kidnappers, and captured two of them.
According to the army, the kidnappers would be linked to an organisation of rebels in Darfur, the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLA_U), which was immediately denied by the Sudanese government.
Letter- The silent majority of culture
On the front page a debate on the financing of the culture on which the current election campaign is concentrated.
That's better.
But part of our cultural life remains in the shadows.
Who will speak to denounce the poor sums granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical sites that make hunger?
What politician will dare to remind the federal government that he is neglecting monuments and heritage buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, do we not have any real laws that actually preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government pays three and a half million euros for the only restoration of the castle of Chinon in the Loire Valley?
With our American neighbours, it is the Constitution that affirms that the protection of the heritage is part of national culture and that the same heritage must be protected by every citizen, by every political authority and by every government department, and all this by common accord.
In Quebec, at the Federation of Historical Societies of Quebec, there are at least 40 000 volunteers who, grouped into 211 societies for the preservation of historical, genealogical, archives and heritage, preserve, with four money, private archives and archaeological sites.
It is they who often defend our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when real estate entrepreneurs and decision-making bodies attack our forgotten remains and graveyards with their bulldozers.
When will the right space be reserved for history and heritage?
The Benelux governments nationalize part of the Fortis bank
The Benelux states are helping through partial nationalisation the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis, which was first in difficulty in Europe for the crisis of the American credit market: the three nations will provide EUR 11.2 billion to the financial institution - insurance with interests also in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands on the weekend agreed at the highest level, including the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Competition.
In the euro area the first major crisis in the context of the difficulties in which the international financial market has been debated for more than a year is that of the Fortis bank, and from a certain point of view the decisions taken in this respect may constitute a precedent.
According to the decision taken on Sunday night all three states will own almost half (49%) of the bank's share in the country.
The bank will almost certainly sell part of its interests, including first of all the assets, especially insurance, of the Dutch ABN Amro acquired a year ago.
Last week the actions of Fortis had begun with a vertical collapse, serious signs of the institution's crisis had then appeared in the second half of the week.
However, analysts agree that the bank, with 85,000 employees, is too large to allow it to go bankrupt.
The bank's shares on Friday fell by almost 12%, the lowest point for 14 years.
Since January the value of the shares has decreased by more than two thirds.
Considering the current stock prices the entire group's capital value is around EUR 14 billion, but according to bank managers this value is not real.
The corporate summit blames the collapse of the Fortis shares on the uncertainties of the extra-European market due to the acceptance of the US plan of 700 billion dollars.
On Monday the title resumed slowly to rise.
Friday Filip Dierckx was appointed new managing director of the bank.
The financial institution has also sought private buyers but so far no one has presented itself with a worthy offer.
The Belgian Government had already ensured that investors should not fear losing money.
Among the bank's customers there was no panic, the branches were not visited.
In Hungary Fortis owns autonomous subsidiaries and has also purchased leasing companies.
The fox in the chicken
In America, life and health insurers often refuse to enter into an insurance contract on the basis of people's medical purchase data.
Privacy experts fear that the data market becomes uncontrollable.
"There is a privacy program that the use of prescription data depends in any case on the approval of the person concerned.
This program must be in independent hands, otherwise it is like entrusting the chicken to the fox" - writes the Washington Post citing Richard Dick as the author of the program to follow the prescriptions of the medicines.
Insurance companies are subject to the insurance rate and the relevant figure in the case of health claims of the potential customer and if they consider the risk too high they do not stipulate the insurance.
Some time ago the customer had to undergo a medical visit and the contract was concluded only after the outcome of the examination.
Dick 10 years ago invented a much cheaper procedure: according to the customer's identification code you can easily have information from the pharmacy about which medicines you bought in the last year and half and from this the evince program of which diseases you suffer and what health conditions you are in.
For example, if you regularly buy large amounts of cholesterol reducers this means that the level of fat in the blood is in practice irrevocably high and is classified into the highest risk category.
There are various versions of the programme on the market, some of which also determine the risk multiplier, so the insurer does not remain much more than paper work, even if there are small difficulties.
Among the counters are that some medicines are usable for more purposes, e.g. some compounds are usable against migraine or heat vapours, but they are also effective against depression.
The latter, from an insurance - commercial point of view, is as a risk increase factor, the first two no.
For the request and processing of data, companies were formed separately and these, before obtaining the necessary information from the pharmacy, require the patient's approval.
Now the authorities force them to do so even if so far they have not imposed fines on negligence.
Some companies have also developed the results of laboratory tests and linked them to medical consumption data in order to provide a more accurate picture of the patient's health status.
More and more companies have access to data and parallel use control will be increasingly difficult.
There is a separate privacy law but its validity extends only to health services and insurance.
In front of the Congress there is a proposal for a law that gives control authority competence to specialized companies in data service.
Richard Dick admits that it is not enough: for this reason he has developed a program that links the other data with the approval expressed by the person concerned.
Another question is that the person concerned cannot deny approval because otherwise insurers do not enter into the contract.
So then in the end the hens are entrusted to the mercy of the fox.
Global Marseille Menu
European Union and India doubling trade
Since the European Union and India are partners that trade mainly in each other, the agenda for the ninth meeting at the summit has also been dominated by this issue, in addition to all other global problems.
Today there will be a Franco-Indian summit which will first discuss cooperation on atomic energy.
The European Union recognises the fact that India is becoming a great democratic power to which we should give more voice in international affairs, but the Member States have not yet been able to decide whether or not to support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
So it did not insist on this issue in the ninth summit held yesterday in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as President-in-Office of the Union, José Manuel Barroso, Chairman of the Committee and Javier Solana, Senior Foreign Representative, received Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they found the agreement to double in 5 years, that is to increase to EUR 100 billion, trade.
Considering that between 2000 and 2007 the trade in goods increased from 25 to 55 billion, this is not too ambitious.
As a result, the 26 bilateral civil flight agreements have been legally unified, so air traffic can also start in the future.
India would like to sign the free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the agreement.
The aim is to balance because while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi is only in ninth place among EU partners.
The summit focused attention on global issues.
To the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and terrorism, the latter was condemned in all its forms by both sides, and called for the convening of a UN conference.
They called for the conclusion of the Doha Round, although both sides played a role in the failure of this.
The EU has confirmed its persistence in the energy and climate programme, that is, it would want to reduce emissions of harmful substances by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agrees on this, as well as on the need for a global agreement to the climate conference scheduled for next year and to reduce greenhouse gas production by 50% by 2050.
They also want to curb the increase in food prices and have supported the convening of an international meeting to examine the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister will now visit the French capital where at a bilateral meeting he is preparing to sign a Treaty on the Peaceful Use of Atomic Energy.
In Paris it is hoped that in order to build the Indian nuclear reactors, French companies will receive a commission worth 20 billion euros.
According to information from our press agency, the agreement would last 15 years.
In Frankfurt over 300 Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the International Book Fair in Frankfurt.
There will be more than three hundred Italian publishers present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international event for the exchange of rights.
The International Frankfurt Book Fair awaits for this edition more than 7 thousand exhibitors from 101 different countries that will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the Fair with more than 403 thousand titles on display and with Turkey as guest of honour.
He will be the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Heritage and Cultural Activities Francesco Maria Giro to represent the Italian Government in the opening ceremony of the Italian Pavilion: Italy will in fact be institutionally present with an Italy Point - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
Follow the press meeting at Room Struktur in the 5.0 hall of Buchmesse: this will be the opportunity to present figures, trends and prospects on the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of foreign authors' books on total Italian production gradually decreases, in particular for adults and young people.
Caught Steve Fossett's plane the billionaire missing a year ago
The wreckage of Steve Fossett's plane was discovered, the billionaire disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying into the Nevada desert.
The cracks were found on a plateau at 3000 meters above sea level, in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammoth Lakes, on the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the aircraft, however, there were no human remains.
The sheriff of Madeira County, John Anderson, fled the remaining doubts: "The plane was located, we sent a team, and now we have the confirmation that this is exactly what Steve Fossett was flying on the day he disappeared," he said at a press conference.
The sheriff has therefore specified that no human remains have been found either on the plane or in the surrounding area.
The billionaire, 63 years old, was killed in February.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Office (Ntsb) reported that a few hours after the wrecking notice was sent a team of investigators, who then identified the device: this is Bellanca 8kcab, dispersed since 3 September 2007, when Fossett took from Yerington to Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fossett's personal effects had been discovered by a couple near their home of Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents named Fossett, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash money and a sweatshirt.
Fossett's research was discontinued a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had won a place in history thanks to a long series of primates.
In 2002, at the sixth attempt, he had become the first man to complete the world tour on an aerostatic ball: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later he had taken the world by plane and without a stopover.
Among his many records, also that of flying at 15,445 meters high, above the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the publicity you don't expect
A Suv out of the diagrams with an original design and well defined by decided lines, wide surfaces and clean corners.
This is, in short, Glk the last born among the "compact" offroads of the star house with which Mercedes-Benz tried to give a lot of news in this sector.
For its contents outside the traditional canons, it will be unexpected and unconventional also the communication that will accompany the launch of the Suv Glk, available at the Mercedes-Benz showrooms since next 17 October.
Thus the advertising battle that will accompany the debut of the new car will start an unprecedented mode of communication also through a future 3D affixing campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a automotive brand.
A project of maxi-affisions, articulated in three different stages, which will dominate the very central way of shopping Milanese, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision and thanks to special glasses distributed near Corso Como it will be possible to see the new Suv in almost real size and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, by looking at the image you will have the impression that the car exits from the manifesto.
Then, through the use of the innovative Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated in different times in all its details, and then recomposed into a single image.
Undoubtedly Mercedes with this advertising is trying to introduce something new into the stereotyped field of automotive communication.
Will it be possible with this formula to awaken the interest of future buyers? We shall see.
That's who the Italian hooligans are.
From the Triveneto, they risk Daspo.
But who are those 150-200 boys and girls of whom all Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the "Ultras Italia" group that has been following the Azzur National and so far, for the truth, had never created excessive problems.
He was never against the opposing typhoids.
The extraction of the group is on the right.
The promoters come from the Trivenet.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
To these Sofia groups were added booklets (a few units, in fact) from Campania and Puglia.
They have three-coloured flags where the cities of origin of militants appear: Saturday evening they were removed to be unidentified.
They are inspired by the English typhoseria.
In Bulgaria they found a typhoseria of real Nazis, that of Levski.
Figc had provided Italian fans with 144 tickets for the match: all names, therefore easily controllable.
And the Viminal had controlled them all: among those gone to Sofia there was no one with a Daspo in progress, no one who had been inhibited by attending a stadium.
Four Azzur fans, who had prior stage crimes, had been denied the ticket and prevented the transfer.
Now the Viminale is waiting to read the acts that will come from the Bulgarian police and then will take action: in this case, it is possible to give Daspo for at least five years to fans who have been arrested or to those who have been identified in the disorder.
An international Daspo that prevents you from attending not only the Italian but all over Europe.
Our hooligans, I mean, will no longer set foot in a stadium.
Lucky for you.
But now there is fear-emulation: that is, to those little more than one hundred and fifty, others add to it.
"We need to put this fire out immediately and not legitimize those who behave in this way," they say.
So, "looks well open especially in view of the National match of Wednesday in Lecce".
In Puglia there is in fact a small core of supporters of the Ultras Italia.
Tomorrow we meet the Observatory, Tuesday the Casms which can also count on a section of the Aise, that is the secret services, which deals precisely with the problems of the stadium.
"The Duke-Duce choirs and the tight arm during Mameli's anthem? In Bulgaria it is not a crime...".
This is the thought (expressed in a truly unhappy way) by Domenico Mazzelli, who has been director of the Viminal Observatory for a few weeks (has taken the place that was previously of Francesco Tagiente and then of Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzelli had previously been a director of Trieste where there is a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzelli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to incinerate the Duke, but of course the behaviour of those 150-200 fans has been shameful.
"I do not do the sociologist - adds the Observatory No.1 - crimes must be attributed in the country in which the fact takes place.
So far this group has remained in line, now we will see what has happened and we will evaluate it for the future.
But we also talk about Mameli's hymn whistles: even those are not criminal, but if you allow me they are not education...".
