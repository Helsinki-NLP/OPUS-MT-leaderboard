Members of the Assembly (AM) of Wales are concerned about "seeming muppets"
Some members of the Assembly are puzzled by the suggestion that their title should be changed to Members of the Welsh Parliament (MWP).
This uncertainty arises from the plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Assembly of the whole political spectrum are concerned that this could be ridiculed.
A member of the Assembly of the Labour Party stated that his group was concerned "that he would rhyme with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means fool and pwp means paca.
A member of the Welsh Party Assembly commented that his entire group was "disgruntled" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Wales Conservative Party stated that his group was "open" to the change of name, but noted that MWP's leap of pronunciation to muppet was small.
In this context, the wording of the letter w in Welsh is similar to that of the letter or in Yorkshire English.
The Committee of the Assembly, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the change of name, states: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptive element of the designation of Members of the Assembly will be the matter of the members themselves".
The Law of 2017 of the Government of Wales granted the Assembly of Wales the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation of the proposals which revealed broad support for calling the Welsh Parliament to the Assembly.
On the issue of the title of Members of the Assembly, the Commission preferred Members of the Welsh Parliament (or WMP), but the MWP option received most of the support in a public consultation.
It appears that members of the Assembly are suggesting alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus could lead to the President of the Assembly, Elin Jones, who should send the bill on changes within a few weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes related to the functioning of the assembly, such as rules on the disabling of Members of the Assembly and the design of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly will have the last word in the question of what should be called when they deliberate on legislation.
Macedonians go to the polls to vote for a referendum on the country's change of name
The voters will vote on Sunday on whether their country's name will be changed to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was convened in an attempt to resolve a decades-old conflict with the neighbouring country, Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has always insisted that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim from its territory and has repeatedly opposed its application for membership of the EU and NATO.
The President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the plebiscite on the change of name, said he would ignore the vote.
However, referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is simply the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of San Martín remain silent because of the difficulties of the churches of Harlem
"Historically, the older people I've talked to say there was a bar and a church in every corner," says Mr. Adams.
"Today, there's not one thing or the other."
He pointed out that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"Now people socialize differently," he says.
"Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhoods to which the neighbors go regularly."
With regard to the churches, he is concerned that the money obtained from the sale of goods will not last as long as the leaders expect and that "before or after, they will return to the starting point".
The churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings full of the type of people who will not help the sanctuaries remaining in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people," he said, "and therefore will speed up the closure of these churches, as it is unlikely that most people who move to these apartments will become members of these churches."
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and San Martín a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation left in the 1930 ’ s.
A black congregation that worshiped nearby acquired the building.
A black congregation took the reins of San Martín, under the direction of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott to street merchants 125, a main shopping street in Harlem, who resisted hiring or promoting black people.
In 1939, a fire left the building badly damaged and, while Father Johnson's parishioners made plans for its reconstruction, they also ordered the wagon.
Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson in San Martín, proudly called him "the campaigns of the poor."
In July, the expert who played the wagon called "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
In addition, the expert Tiffany Ng of Michigan University noted that she was the world's first black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who left to play Riverside Church's largest car, 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather commented that St. Martin didn't replace him.
What has happened in San Martín in recent months has been a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought by the lay leaders of the church and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The parish board, the governing body of the parish, composed of secular leaders, wrote to the diocese in July commenting on its concern that the diocese "try to pass costs" to the council, although it had not participated in the recruitment of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of the diocese’s lack of transparency.
Shark wounds a 13-year-old kid who was diving for lobsters in California
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old child on Saturday while diving for lobsters in California on the day the lobster season opened, according to the authorities.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel informed the San Diego KSWB-TV channel that he had been diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the child asking for help, so he approached a group to get him out of the water.
Hammel commented that, at first, he thought he was just excited about catching a lobster, but then he realized that "he was screaming that he had been bitten by them.

he had the broken clavicle," observed Hammel when he arrived next to the child.
"I called everyone out of the water because there was a shark," Hammel added.
The child was transported by helicopter to Rady Children Hospital, where he is in critical condition.
The type of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, commented on a press conference that saw a shark in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it had not been considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim had traumatic injuries in the upper torso area.
The authorities closed access to the beach, from Ponto Beach, Casablad, to Swami Beach, Encinitas, for 48 hours to investigate and for security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
The plans of Sainsbury's drive the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's acquires Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, which have many specialized employees in the corridors of their style and beauty establishments.
In order to significantly boost the UK beauty market, valued at 2800 billion pounds and with a growth that is increasing compared to the fall in fashion sales and household care, the largest beauty corridors will be tested in 11 shops across the country and, if successfully overcome it, will be done in more shops next year.
The investment in beauty comes at the same time as this chain of supermarkets looks for ways to use space in shelves that used to be used for televisions, microwaves and household care.
Sainsbury's stated that it would double its offer of beauty with up to 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
In addition, more space will be given to the existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, with areas similar to those of other establishments, such as Boots.
The chain will also relaunch its Boutique makeup range with a majority of animals-friendly products, something increasingly demanded by younger customers.
Also, in the perfumery The Fragrance Shop will test its concessions in two Sainsbury's establishments, the first recently inaugurated in Croydon, South London, last week. The second will be inaugurated in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online stores and the shift towards daily buying of small amounts of food in local shops force supermarkets to strive to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, the executive director of Sainsbury's, has stated that shops will increasingly look like shopping malls while the supermarket chain tries to fight off the Aldi and Lidl discount facilities by offering more services and products than they are for food.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos discount points into hundreds of establishments and has introduced several Habitats since its purchase of these chains two years ago. It is considered that this has boosted the sales of edible and profitable more these purchases.
The previous attempt by the supermarket chain to renew its beauty and pharmacy departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's tested a joint operation with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended after a discussion on how to divide the revenues from drug outlets in their supermarkets.
The new strategy arises after the sale of the 281 pharmaceutical establishments from Sainsbury to Celesio, a company owned by the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
It is noted that Lloyds will participate in the plan, adding an expanded range of luxury brands for skin care, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
As Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's commented: "We have transformed the appearance and environment of our beauty corridors in a way that enhances the environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in a specialized staff that will be available to provide advice.
Our offer of brands is designed to adapt to all needs. On the other hand, an attractive environment and a comfortable location makes us an irresistible destination for beauty products, challenging the old way to buy".
Peter Jones is "angry" after Holly Willoughby breaks an 11 million-pound deal
Peter Jones, the star of Dragon's Den, went "angry" after the TV host Holly Willoughby broke an 11 million-pound deal with her lifestyle business line to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time to dedicate to the fashion brand and Truly accessories.
This business had compared with Gwyneth Paltew's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old presenter of This Morning announced that she was leaving the business on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has angered Peter Jones, Dragon's Den star, by abandoning his lucrative lifestyle business in the last minute to focus on his extraordinary new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to the sources consulted, Jones was "wrong" when the golden girl on television admitted that her new agreements, valued at up to £1.5 million, did not leave time to dedicate themselves to Truly, her fashion brand and complements, during a tense meeting held on Tuesday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire.
The business had compared with Gwyneth Paltew's Goop brand and was profiled as a favorite to double Willoughby's fortune, about £11 million.
While Willoughby, aged 37, announced that he was leaving the business on Instagram, Jones left Britain to go to one of his holiday homes.
As one source commented: "Truly was, by contrast, Holly's main priority.
It was going to be their long-term future, which would keep it for the next two decades.
His decision to leave left everyone totally stunned.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of merchandise at Marlow's headquarters, products ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter from This Morning, one of Britain's most profitable stars, could cost the company millions due to the significant investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothes, and possibly further delay its launch.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are parents of three children and ten years ago they have a close relationship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby established Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, aged 52, joined as president in March.
Couples went on vacation together and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's television producer.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as a host of the I'm A Celebrity program on the ITV channel.
A source close to Jones stated that last night "there was no talk about business issues."
A difficult conversation "and then fall in love"
He was joking about the criticism he received from the media for making a comment that some would consider "unpresidential" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump commented with his dumb voice about "News Presenter."
"I have not given up anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in meeting him again after Trump commended the first meeting held in June in Singapore, which considered a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, the negotiations for denuclearization have stalled.
More than three months after the June Summit in Singapore, North Korean senior diplomat Ri Yong Ho explained to the world leaders gathered in the UN General Assembly on Saturday that his country does not see an "adequate response" from the United States to the first steps towards North Korea's disarmament.
On the contrary, he noted, the United States continues to apply sanctions in order to maintain pressure.
Trump's perspective was much more optimistic in the speech he gave during his rally.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a fantastic relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have generated positive results: the end of missile tests, help free hostages and bring the deadly remains of U.S. soldiers back home.
He also defended his unusual approach to talking about relations with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but so, instead of 10,000 people out there trying to enter this crowded stadium, we would have about 200 people right here," said Trump, pointing out the people who were right in front of him.
A tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia destroy an island, leaving hundreds of dead
Following the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that their assistance was not necessary.
Although more than 10 per cent of the Lombok population had had to move, there was no national emergency, a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they do not request international assistance, which makes things a little complicated," says Mrs Subou.
Although Save the Children is preparing a team that will send to Palu, they are still unsure whether foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, spokesperson for the national emergency agency, explained that the authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organizations were allowed to assist.
Considering that the land is constantly moving in Indonesia, the country remains incredibly unprepared when nature unleashes its anger.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, there are not so many in other coastal areas.
The apparent lack of tsunami alert sirens in Palu, even though there was a prior warning, is likely to have contributed to the loss of lives.
At best, travelling from one island in Indonesia to another is a challenge.
Natural disasters further complicate logistics.
A hospital ship in Lombok to attend to the victims of the earthquake is heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the enclave of the new catastrophe.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of Indonesia's worn-out infrastructure the central axis of his electoral campaign, and has spent enough money on roads and railway lines.
However, the lack of funding has affected the administration of Mr Joko, who is facing a re-election next year.
In addition, it must face the pressure of the persistent sectarian tensions of Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands had to leave their homes while Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using machetes, bows and arrows, and other rudimentary weapons.
Look at this: Daniel Sturridge, from Liverpool, equals the marker in front of Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved the Liverpool from a defeat in the Premier League in front of Chelsea with a goal in the minute 89 on Saturday at the Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri over 27 metres from Chelsea's door when the marker was 1-0.
He placed the ball on his left foot with a touch before throwing it to the second pole.
The action led him over the area and headed towards the top right corner of the network.
Finally, the ball passed over Kepa Arrizabalaga who tried to stop him with a jump and fell on the net.
"I was trying to put myself in that position to do with the ball and players like Shaq always play very advanced, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw that Kante was approaching and I gave him a touch. I didn't think so much, just shot it."
Chelsea was winning 1-0 in the first half after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the minute 25.
The midpoint of the Blues made a heel pass to Mateo Kovacic in that play, before spinning a race near the middle field and entering the Liverpool field.
Kovacic quickly passed the ball and ran out in the middle of the field.
Then he made a beautiful pass to the space that led Hazard to the area.
Hazard stood in front of the defense and ended up throwing the ball into the network of the second post with a kick with the left foot that Alisson Becker, from Liverpool, could not stop.
On Wednesday at 3 p.m., Liverpool plays against Naples in the group phase of the Champions League. The meeting will be held at St. Paul's Stadium in Naples, Italy.
For its part, Chelsea faces Videoton at UEFA Europe League Thursday at 15:00 in London.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami increased to 832
The number of victims from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has increased to 832, as reported by the country ' s emergency agency at the first hour of Sunday.
Many people were trapped in the rubble of the buildings that collapsed during the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that occurred on Friday and triggered waves up to six metres, reports the agency's spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho during a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with remains of the collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man as a murder suspect after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been initiated after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 with stab wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, which alleged the arrest of a 32-year-old man as a murder suspect.
The police have urged people in the area who have seen or heard something to come to the police.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan commented: "The investigation is in the early stages, but I would encourage anyone who was near Jonh Street in Birkenhead, and who has seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
In addition, I would recommend that anyone, especially taxi drivers, have been able to capture something in Dashcam to contact us, as they may have vital information for our research."
A police spokesperson has confirmed that the woman whose body has been found is Birkenhead and found inside a property.
This afternoon some people who thought they knew the woman came to the crime scene to find out where they had found her this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police have reported that they are in the process of informing the family members of the victim.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has tried to get back into his apartment, but the police tell him no one can get in or out of the building.
He became perplexed when he discovered what had happened.
Residents are now informed that they will be allowed to return in a few hours.
Someone heard an agent tell a man that the whole area was treating himself as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in the place in tears.
He keeps repeating "it's terrible."
At two o'clock in the afternoon, there were two police vans inside the cordon and one outside.
Several agents remained standing within the cord controlling the block of floors.
Any person with information is requested to send an email to DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, register 247 of 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell of Parliament becomes the last commemorative success for "rewriting history"
His prohibition would be an act of poetic justice for this Taliban-style destruction of so many cultural and religious objects in England carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestions as a "crazy" and an "intense to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, commented: "In the current debate on the disposal of statues, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell from the Palace of Westminster would become an objective.
The iconoclastia of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
It may be sacrificed to the wrong Cromwell for the actions of his ancestor, Thomas, during the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Cromwell is a proof of the opinion of the 19th century and of the historiography of a figure that many consider worthy to celebrate.
As Mr Goldsmith pointed out to The Sunday Telegraph: "Many consider Cromwell, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, a parliamentary defender against external pressure, in this case, it is clear, the monarchy.
If this is a completely accurate description, it is a matter of continuing the historical debate.
What is true is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure that represents a face of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration."
A killer pig attacks a Chinese livestock
A pig attacked and killed a farmer in a southwest China market, according to local media.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan", was found dead with a sectioned and covered artery of blood near a pit of the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, as reported on Sunday by South China Morning Post.
On 30 May 2005, a pig breeder was prepared to inject vaccines to pigs from a pocilga in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
Apparently, he traveled with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a nearby well was open.
He said there was a big pig with blood in his mouth at the well.
The forensic examination confirmed that the pig nearly 250 kilos had attacked the farmer until death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and broken," said the cousin, to whom they address his last name, "Wu", to The Guiyang Evening News.
The images of the security camera showed Yuan entering the market on Thursday at 4:40 to feed their pigs.
Her body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed man belonged neither to Yuan nor his cousin.
A market manager informed The Evening News that the pig was closed to prevent him from attacking anyone else while the police collected evidence in place.
It seems that Yuan family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for their death.
Though they're weird, it's not the first time a pig attacks a person.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on his farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a pig nearly 295 kilos ran to a farmer in his tractor until his wife frightened the animal.
After pigs were eaten by a farmer from Oregon in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "shooter".
"They're just playing.
They're like kids, very curious... their intention is not to hurt.
What we have to do is have proper respect for them," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will leave heavy rains generalized in the southwest of the United States.
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the coldest waters on the north coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will leave torrential rains all over northern Mexico and southwest of the United States in the coming days.
Rosa caused gusts of wind of more than 136 km/h, a hurricane of category 1, from Sunday to 5:00 in the morning (East time) and was located almost 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
Rosa is expected to travel north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, in the Pacific Ocean, low pressures are starting to develop, moving eastward towards the West Coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday, a tropical storm will begin to push heavy tropical rains toward the north, to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will leave more than 25 cm of rain in some areas of Mexico on Monday.
Finally, when the tropical rain strikes with the low pressure approaching, there will be strong widespread rainfall in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, between 2 and 10 cm of rain will cause dangerous floods, debris flows and possible spills in the desert.
Heavy tropical rains will cause precipitation of almost 5 to 8 centimeters per hour in specific areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Between 5 and 10 centimeters of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Due to the dispersed nature of tropical rains, sudden flooding may occur with rapidly worsening conditions.
Because of this threat of tropical torrential rains, it is not recommended at all to venture in the desert on foot.
Strong rains could turn cannons into rivers that are crumbling and storms will cause broken winds and dust clouds locally.
The low pressures approaching will leave heavy rains in concrete parts of the southern coast of California.
The torrential rains may leave up to two inches of water, which could cause small debris flows and make the roads slippery.
It would be the first torrential rains in the region during the wet season.
Some scattered tropical hats will begin to approach Arizona at the last hour of Sunday and first hour of Monday, before the rain is generalized at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rains will extend to the Four Corners on Tuesday and throughout Wednesday.
In October there will be some intense changes in temperature in the United States due to the cooling of the Arctic and the warmth of the tropics.
Sometimes, this implies drastic changes in temperature at short distances.
A good example of these temperature differences is what will happen throughout the U.S. center on Sunday.
There will be a difference of almost 7 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the prolonged summer heat will try to recover and expand again.
In much of the center and east of the United States is expected a warm beginning of October, with general temperatures that will round the 26 degrees from the South Plain to parts of the northeast.
On Tuesday, in New York, temperatures of up to 26 degrees could be reached, about 12 degrees above average.
Our long-term forecast indicates high probability of temperatures above average for the east of the United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people saw Brett Kavanaugh's appearance
More than 20 million people followed the overwhelming testimonies that Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court candidate, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of alleged sexual assault in the 1980s, gave on Thursday six television channels.
Meanwhile, politics continued to be deadlock and the media disrupted their usual programming to broadcast the latest news on Friday: an agreement designed by Senator Jeff Blake of Arizona to conduct an investigation of the accusations for a week.
Ford informed the Senate Judicial Commission that he was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh touched her in a state of drunkenness and that he tried to take her clothes off at an institute party.
During his passionate testimony, Kavanaugh said he was absolutely sure that had not happened.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people who commented on Nielsen on Friday have seen it.
The company accounted for the average audience in CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not available immediately for other channels that broadcast it, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen often has some problems calculating how many people see something in the office.
To put it in perspective, it is an audience similar to that of an American football game of the playsoffs or Oscar prizes.
Fox News Channel, whose Tertullians have strongly supported the designation of Kavanaugh, fuel the leading channel, with an average of 5.69 million spectators during an all-day appearance, said Nielsen.
ABC took second place, with 3.26 million spectators.
The CBS had 3.1 million, the NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and the CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen commented.
After the appearance, a great interest continued.
Flake was the central character of Friday's drama.
After the moderate republican's office issued a statement informing him that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, on Friday morning the cameras of the CNN and the CBS captured how some demonstrators shouted at him when he tried to climb an elevator to attend an appearance before the Judicial Commission.
As he received these complaints, broadcast live by the CNN, he was shot down.
"Looking at my face," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
And he continued: "You have power when there are so many women who don't have it."
Flake said that his office had issued a communiqué and, before the elevator doors were closed, that he would count more in his presence before the Commission.
The cable and broadcasting channels broadcast everything live hours later, when the Judicial Commission had to vote to propose Kavanaugh's candidacy for the Senate to vote on it.
However, Flake said that he would only do so if the FBI investigated the charges made against the candidate during the following week, which some Democrats had been asking for.
Flake was convinced, in part, by the conversations he had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was fundamental, as it was clear that Republicans would not have the votes enough to approve Kavanaugh without that investigation.
President Trump has initiated an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "making politics" with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics with his plan to leave the European Union of "making politics" with Britain's future and undermining national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives in Congress of the Conservative Party to be held in Birmingham, Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview published next to her on the cover of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson insisted on his attack on the alleged Chequers plan for Brexit, stating that one proposal for Britain and the EU to charge the other's tariffs was "totally absurd".
Wayde Murder: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson as Suspected of LSU Player Death · Global Voices
Police arrested a suspect for the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player in LSU, during a shooting.
Dyteon Simpson, aged 20, has been arrested and imprisoned for a second-degree murder charge, according to Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police pointed out that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses at the crime scene and said they had found Simpson's DNA in them, reports WAFB, CBS subsidiary.
After questioning Simpson, the police said they admitted to shooting at Wayde.
A bond of $350,000 has been established, according to the defence.
The Baton Rouge District Instruction Court This issued a preliminary report on Friday, indicating that the cause of death had been a bullet wound on the head.
The department recognizes the merits of the fugitive unit of the Louisiana State Police, the State Police Criminalistics Laboratory, Southern University Police and citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, sports director of LSU, thanked the police forces in the area for their "diligence and search for justice".
Sims was 20.
The player, who was over two meters tall, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball in LSU.
He had obtained an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in a part of the last season.
On Friday morning, Will Wade, basketball coach at LSU, declared his team to be "destructed" and "in shock" for Wayde's death.
"These are the things people always care about," Wade said.
An ash-drop volcano in Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the neighborhoods located south of the capital of Mexico.
On Saturday, the National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after the crater showed activity and recorded 183 gas emissions and ash within 24 hours.
The centre recorded several earthquakes and shakings.
On social media, the images showed thin layers of ash covering the windshields of vehicles in neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed greater activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometres south-east of the capital, since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police face Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested on Saturday in Barcelona after independent protesters faced the anti-disturbes while thousands of people participated in opposition demonstrations coincidering with the first anniversary of the polarized Catalonia referendum on secession.
A group of hooded separatists who had been cut off by the antidisturbes threw eggs and powder painting, creating dark dust clouds in the streets, which are usually full of tourists.
There were also clashes in later hours, and the police used hookers to contain the fight.
For several hours, independent groups, with messages such as "not forgotten or forgiven", faced unionist protesters with the cry of "Viva España".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries suffered during the protests, according to local media.
Tensions remain high in this region one year after the vote of 1 October, considered illegal by Madrid, but held by separatist Catalans.
The voters elected independence by overwhelming majority, although participation was low, as the people who opposed the secession greatly boycotted the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to prevent voting at electoral tables throughout the region, where violent clashes occurred.
Independence groups camped on Friday night to avoid a demonstration of support for the National Police.
The demonstration continued, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife said he had no hope of Catalonia becoming independent.
"Last year we lived one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry with joy for voting, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite achieving a vital victory, although narrow, in the regional elections of last December, pro-Catalanist parties have struggled to retain momentum this year, as many of their most well-known leaders, whether in self-imposed or detained exile, are awaiting trial for their role in the organization of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, who recorded the police's support protest on his phone, said that the conflict had been revived by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced that he would participate in the elections to the European Parliament next year.
"Being a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish Government," he said.
Londonderry: men arrested for embezzling a house with a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after repeatedly laying down a Londonderry house with a car.
The incident took place on Thursday around 19:30 in Ballynagard Crescent.
Inspector Bob Blemmings commented that there were damage to accesses and the building itself.
At some point, he may have shot himself in the car with a bullet.
A Menga Attack Grants 1-0 Victory to Livingston Against the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ensured victory
A promoted Livingston impressed the Rangers by getting the second defeat for Steven Gerrard in 18 matches as a coach at the Iberian club.
Dolly Menga's attack marked the difference. Gary Holt's went up a post, with the Hibernian in second position.
This season, Gerard's have not yet won any wins outside the house and next Sunday they face the Hearts, leaders of the board with eight points of advantage.
First, Rangers receive the Rapid Vienna on Thursday at the League of Europe.
Meanwhile, Livingston expands his victory rack in the division to six games. Holt, the incumbent coach, hasn't tasted the defeat since he replaced Kenny Mile last month.
Livingston lets you pass opportunities in front of a sharp visitor
Holt's team had to have gone one step ahead long before marking, causing all sorts of problems to Rangers for their direct game.
Scott Robinson overcame the defense, but failed his attempt in front of the portery. Later, Alan Lithgow was fired off after being incarcerated to finish Craig Halkett's head center in front of the portery.
The host team was content to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause problems for visitors with standing balloons.
That's how the ultimate goal came about.
The Rangers gave them a free shot and Livingston sought an entrance, with a combined play of Declan Gallagher and Robinson for Menga, which struck the ball and marked from the center of the area.
At that time, the Rangers dominated the possession, but they could not pass the host's defense and the doorkeeper, Liam Kelly, was quite quiet.
That game went on until the second part, although Alfredo Morelos forced a Kelly stop.
Allan McGregor, the Rangers' porter rejected a shot of Scott Pittman from one kick, and Lithgow stayed away from another Livingston play.
In the Livingston area, long passes were constantly entered, but they were always cleared. Two criminal requests were rejected, one after a Halkett entrance on alternate Glenn Middleton and one by one hand.
Livingston "Fenomenal" (analysis)
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Stadium
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
The unanimous opinion is that they made an excellent game that continued to exceed the expectations of an ascending trajectory.
Your game style and your template have barely experienced changes since your promotion, but this is largely due to Holt by the way he has strengthened the team since its arrival.
He had many heroes.
Halkett, the team captain, was enormous and led a magnificently organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall alert at all times.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they had very good moments with Gerard, they were short.
They lacked to materialize the plays, as they only managed to enter the opposing field once, which is a call of attention to the Rangers, which are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan has received an ambiguous welcome in Cologne
On Saturday 29 September there were smiles and a blue sky during the breakfast of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, with the aim of restoring relations between NATO allies.
They have discussed issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Later, Erdogan went to Cologne to inaugurate a huge new mosque.
The city welcomes the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police claimed security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from meeting in front of the mosque, but many sympathizers were in the vicinity to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan opponents, many of them Kurdish, were also heard who condemned Erdogan's policies as well as the German government's decision to receive him in the country.
These manifestations reflect the division that this visitor is, received as a hero by some German Turks and considered as an autocrat by others.
Traffic accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies after colliding with a vehicle
A cyclist died in a car accident in London.
The accident occurred near Bestwookd Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15.
The car driver stopped and the cyclist was taken care of by the paramedics, but died right there.
The accident occurred after another cyclist died after being hit by a vehicle that ran off on Childers Street, almost two kilometres from the site of the Saturday accident.
The Metropolitan Police said the officers were working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Roads have been cut off and buses diverted, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six agents injured after riots
Six prison officials have been injured in an altercation produced in a high-security prison for men, according to the Prison Directorate.
The riots began at Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m. on Sunday and are still continuing.
Specialists of an elite team (called "Tornado") are in charge of controlling the altercations, in which eight inmates participate and affect a pavilion.
Officers were assisted by slight injuries to the face at the site.
A penitentiary spokesman comments: "It has been deployed to specialized prison personnel to deal with the ongoing incident at Long Lartin Prison.
Six staff members have received health care for injuries.
In our prisons violence is not tolerated and we make it clear that those responsible will be placed in the hands of the police and could spend more time between bars."
Long Lartin prison is home to more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had received hospital medical assistance after an inmate attacked him.
In addition, in October last year, anti-disturbing agents were asked to go to prison to deal with a serious altercation in which prison personnel were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (the dry areas may benefit)
It is unusual for a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that is exactly what could happen at the beginning of the week when the last collections of Hurricane Rosa crossed the southwest of the desert, at risk of sudden flooding.
The National Meteorology Service has already issued sudden flooding alerts for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, south and east Nevada and southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head straight to Phoenix on Tuesday, leaving rain at the end of Monday.
The Phoenix National Meteorology Service commented on a tweet that only "ten hurricanes had retained their state of tropical storm or depression in a 321 km radius of Phoenix since 1950.
In 1967 Hurricane Katrina approached the Arizona border almost 65 kilometres away."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Centre range from 5 to 10 cm of torrential rain, which can reach 15 cm in isolated areas of the Mogollón Scarpe in Arizona.
They are likely to fall between 2 and 5 inches of rain, with the possibility of reaching 10 in isolated places, in other areas of the southwest of the desert, including the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin.
In places that are not at risk of sudden flooding, the rains of Rosa can be considered a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Although a flood is a very serious issue, some of these torrential rains are likely to be beneficial due to the drought conditions currently occurring in the southwest.
According to the United States Drought Monitor, more than 40% of Arizona is suffering from at least extreme drought, the second highest category, as reported atweather.com.
First, the itinerary of Hurricane Rosa will crash the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, who on Sunday morning will still have a hurricaneed force with maximum bursts of 136 kilometres per hour, is 619 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and moves north to 19 kilometres per hour.
The storm is encountering colder waters in the Pacific, so it is losing strength.
Thus, it is expected to cool down to Mexico with the intensity of a tropical storm during the afternoon of Monday.
Heavy torrential rains could fall in some parts of Mexico, which are at considerable risk of flooding.
"A torrential rain is expected from 7 to 15 cm from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with the possibility of reaching 25 cm", as reported atweather.com.
Then, Rosa will head north of Mexico as a tropical storm, before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression. Later, she will travel across Arizona to the south of Utah at the last hour of Tuesday night.
"The main danger of Rosa or her remains is the strong torrential rain in Baja California, the northwest of Sonora and the southwest of the U.S. desert," says the National Center of Hurricanes.
These rains are expected to cause dangerous floods and debris flows in the deserts, as well as landslides in mountain areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old have been arrested as suspects of an attempted murder after a 16-year-old girl with white gunshot wounds had been found in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the area of Excelsior Terrace, in Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 on Saturday.
He was transferred to a hospital, where he remains "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18-and one 20-year-old was arrested that same night in the Radstock area in Avon, according to Somerset Police.
Agents have appealed to anyone who may have recorded what happened with the mobile phone.
Trump says that Kavanaugh "has suffered the misery and wrath" of the Democratic Party
"To vote for Judge Kavanaugh is to vote to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a rally held in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has "suffered the mercy and wrath" of the Democratic Party throughout the entire appointment process.
Kavanaugh testified to Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that she had been sexually assaulted decades ago when they were teenagers.
Also, Ford testified at the session on this accusation.
On Saturday, the president said that on that day, the "Americans saw the cunning, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"To vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is to vote to confirm one of the legalists with more achievements today, a lawyer with an admirable record of public service," he told his West Virginia followers.
The president made indirect references to Kavanaugh's candidacy in discussing the importance of Republican participation in mid-term elections.
"It takes five weeks for one of the most important elections in our lives.
I don't introduce myself, but it's a race," he said.
"That's why I'm going from place to place fighting to get great candidates."
Trump claimed that the Democrats are embarking on a mission of "resistance and obstruction."
It is expected that the first key procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh will be held no later than Friday, reported a high position of leadership of the Republican Party to the CNN.
Hundreds of deceased people in an earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, the figure is increasing
At least 384 people have died and many have been dragged by the huge waves that floated the beaches after a strong earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, as reported on Saturday by the authorities.
Hundreds of people had gathered to celebrate a festival on the beach of the city of Palu on Friday when waves of up to six meters reached the coast at night, dragging many to death and destroying everything in their footsteps.
The tsunami occurred after an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
"When it was warned yesterday that a tsunami could occur, people were still on the beach and did not flee immediately, so they were victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the National Agency for Disaster Management (BNPB, for its Indonesian acronyms) in Indonesia, in a press conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, dragged cars, logs, houses, devastated everything on the ground," Nugroho said. The tsunami had moved across the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
He also added that some people had climbed into the trees to escape the tsunami and had survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Air photographs published by the agency showed the destruction of many buildings and shops, broken and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The replicas continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
The Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) reported in a statement that the energy released by the great earthquake of Friday was 200 times higher than that of the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima in World War II.
He added that the geography of the city, which sits at the end of a long and narrow bay, could have magnified the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "important" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, malls and hotels had collapsed.
According to him, bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of destroyed buildings. In addition, 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho noted that the number of victims and damage could be greater along the 300 km of coast north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications "were totally paralyzed and there was no information" by Donggala, Nugroho commented.
"There live more than 300,000 people," said the Red Cross in a communiqué, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy of itself, but it could be much worse," he said.
On Saturday, the agency received many criticisms not to report that a tsunami had hit Palu, although those responsible claim that the waves had already reached the coast when the alert was issued.
In a recording captured by an amateur and shared on social media, a man was heard on the last floor of a building warning the people on the street that a tsunami was approaching.
In a matter of minutes, a water wall hits the coast, leading ahead buildings and cars.
Reuters was not able to validate the material immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a great blackout that cut communications around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue work.
The army began sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, declaring the authorities, but displaced persons still need food and other commodities.
The airport of the city has reopened itself for relief tasks and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has a scheduled visit to Paul's evacuation centres on Sunday.
The number of victims by the Indonesian tsunami is over 800.
It's a very bad thing.
Although World Vision staff from Donggala have arrived safely and safely in the city of Palu, where employees take refuge under canvases installed in the garden of their offices, they have seen a devastating panorama on their way, said Mr. Doseba.
"They told me they had seen many destroyed houses," he said.
It's a very bad thing.
Even while the aid groups launched the disaster assistance gears, some people complained that the displacement of experienced co-operatives to Palu was not being permitted.
According to Indonesian legislation, funding, supplies and staffing of foreign personnel can only be used if the site concerned is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a provincial catastrophe," commented Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for Red Cross in Indonesia.
"As soon as the Government says it considers it a national disaster, we can begin to provide international assistance, but it has not yet happened."
As the second night fell in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday, friends and relatives of the people who were still missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be the miracles that brought some light to the devastating stories that write natural disasters.
On Saturday a small child was taken out of a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, an instructor of Indonesia's national paragliding team, had formed two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier that month in Indonesia.
Others who were caught at the Roa Roa Hotel, Mr. Mandagi included, were their students.
"For my experience in the paragliding field, I carry my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon recalled how, in the hours following the news that the Roa Roa hotel had collapsed in the paragliding community, he had sent desperate messages from WhatsApp to the competitors of Palu, who participated in the festival on the beach.
However, his messages only showed a gray check mark, not two in blue.
"I think that means the messages weren't delivered," he said.
Thieves carry 26,750 USD during a reload of an automatic cashier in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves robbed an employee of Brink who was charging an ATM at Newport on the Levee, carrying $26,750, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied an automatic cashier located in the leisure center and was preparing to recharge it with more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the note.
While he was busy, another man "appeared to run behind Brink's employee" and stole a money bag intended for reloading.
According to the note, there were witnesses who saw several suspects leaving the place, but the police did not specify the number of those involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identities must contact the Newport Police in number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapero Changes Name to Ye
The Kanye West rapper will start calling himself Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday: "The person formerly known as Kanye West."
It's been a while since West, 41-year-old, is nicknamed Ye, which he used as a title for his eighth album, released in June.
The change arrives before its appearance at Saturday Night Live, where it is expected to present its new album, Yandhi.
It replaces singer Ariana Grande, who had to cancel her performance by "emotional reasons", as the creator of the program commented.
In addition to being an abbreviation for his current professional name, West had previously said that the word was of religious importance to him.
"I think it's the most commonly used word in the Bible, where it means 'you'," said West earlier this year as he talked about the album's title with the radio speaker Big Boy.
"It's you, it's us, it means us.
He became Kanye, meaning ‘the only one’, to Ye, a reflection of our good, bad and confusing things, all.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
It is one of the many famous rappers who have changed the name.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
An old West collaborator, JAY-Z, has used his name in capital letters, with or without script.
Mexican AMLO promises not to use the army against the civilian population
Andrés Manuel López Obrador, elected Mexican president, has promised never to use the army against the civilian population, now approaching the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students in the country.
On Saturday, López Obrador promised in Plaza Tlatelolco that "he would never use the army to suppress the people of Mexico."
On 2 October 1968, troops fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were growing across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by giving monthly grants to those studying and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities led young people to join criminal gangs.
U.S. funding should double the funding of I.A.
Now that China is more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double its investment in research in this field, says Kai-Fu Lee, I.A. investor and professional who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments then appear on notices relating to I.A. from several parts of the U.S. Government, even when, in general, the U.S. lacks an official I.A. strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become number 1 in innovation in IA by 2030.
"Dualizing the research budget for I.A. would be a good start, since all other countries go far behind the US. We have a look at the next advance in the field of I.A." says Lee.
Double funding means twice as many possibilities as possible for the next major I.A. achievement to be achieved in the United States, as Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by the editorial Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the executive director of Innovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the most important I.A. companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an I.A. system that won the best U.S. Othello player. Later, he was executive at Microsoft Research and president of the Google subsidiary in China.
Lee acknowledged the previous U.S. government technological competitions, such as the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when it would be the next one, which would identify the next generation of visionaries.
In the United States, researchers often have to work hard to obtain government subsidies, Lee said.
"It is not China that is taking academic leaders; it is corporations," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technological companies have hired leading university staff to work at I.A.
Lee commented that some changes in migration policy could also help the United States intensify its initiatives in I.A.
"I think doctors in I.A. should have permanent residence cards automatically," he said.
The China State Council presented its Plan for the Development of the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China funds people from academic institutions like the National Foundation for Science and other government organizations finance American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, whose purpose is to attract industrial and academic partners. For its part, the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month DARPA announced an investment of $2000 million in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the National Foundation for Science, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in research by I.A.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that tried to create a National Artificial Intelligence Security Commission has not carried out any action in months.
Macedonians decided in a referendum on whether they would change their country's name
The people of Macedonia decided in a referendum held on Sunday whether their name would change to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a gesture that would resolve a decades-old conflict with Greece, which had blocked their candidacy for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that its northern neighbour's name is a claim from its territory and has banned its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, both Governments reached agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argued that change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slav population, the majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign questioned whether participation would reach the minimum required for the referendum to be considered valid.
The referendum paper asked the following question: "Are you in favour of accession to NATO and the EU with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is a price worth paying for Macedonia, one of the countries emerging from the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to try to access bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because this is a safer life for all," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although it will not be legally binding, many Members of Parliament have said they will respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that irregularities had not been reported at one afternoon.
However, participation was only 16 %, compared with 34% of the last elections to Parliament held in 2016, when 66% of registered voters voted.
"I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, who was voting in the capital, Skopje.
Zoran Zaev, Macedonian Prime Minister, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in the Macedonia referendum on a change of name for the country that would open the way to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of Parliament, in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavarkov prepared a small stage and took out chairs in front of the tents planted by those who were going to boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of entering NATO and the EU, but we want to do it with a very high head, not through the back door," said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want us to enter into Macedonia, we can establish relations with other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said that accession to NATO would bring the investment that Macedonia so much needs, whose unemployment rate is more than 20 per cent.
"I think the vast majority will be in favour, as more than 80% of citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He said a positive result would be a "confirmation of our future."
In a survey published last Monday by the Policy Research Institute, between 30 and 43% of voters were assured that they would participate in the referendum, which is less than what is required.
Another survey conducted by Telma TV from Macedonia revealed that 57% of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said he would vote in favour.
In order for the referendum to be considered a success, participation must be 50% plus one vote.
If it fails, it would be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it came to power in May last year.
Look at this: Sergio Agüero, from Manchester City, dodges all Brighton's defense to score a goal
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling reversed Brighton's defense in the 2-0 victory that Manchester City won on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
For Agüero, it was ridiculously easy to score a goal in the minute 65.
The Argentine midpoint received a pass in the middle field at the beginning of the play.
He ran between three Brighton defenses before entering the open field.
Once there, he was surrounded by four green t-shirts.
He dodged from a defense before overcoming several more on the edge of the Brighton area.
He walked left, where Sterling was.
The English forwarder used his first touch in the area to return the ball to Agüero, who hit him with the right foot to avoid the goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot that came to the right side of the net.
"Aguro has some problems on his foot," said Pep Guardiola, a city coach, to journalists.
"We talked about playing between 55 and 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at the time."
However, it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League count.
The goal came in the minute 29.
In that play, Agüero received the ball far within Brighton's territory.
He made a nice ball pass to the left side for Leroy Sane.
Sane gave him some touches before heading to Sterling towards the second pole.
Sky blues' front threw the ball over the net just before leaving the limits.
The City faces Hoffenheim in a league match of the Champions League on Tuesday at 12:55 in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena of Sinsheim (Germany).
Scherzer wants to water the Rockies party
With the Nationals eliminated from the playoff count, there was no reason to force another opening.
Even so, the always competitive Scherzer expects to step up the monticle on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if these, won before Los Angeles Dodgers in the Division West of the National League, they still have opportunities in the playoffs.
The Rockies secured at least one wildcard post thanks to the 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but still pursue their first division title.
"Although we don't play anything, at least we can step on the rubber with the assurance that the audience of Denver will be excited and that the other team will probably play at the highest level that I've faced this year.
Why wouldn't I want to participate?"
The Nationals still have to announce an opening for Sunday, but they seem to be inclined to let Scherzer be launched in that situation.
Scherzer, who would open number 34, held a practice session on Thursday and will return to his normal break on Sunday.
The history of Washington's left is 18 victories and 7 defeats, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts with 2/3 in 220 entries.
Trump's doing a rally in West Virginia
The president made indirect references to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, his selection for the Supreme Court, in discussing the importance of Republican participation in elections in mid-term terms.
"In November everything we've done is at stake.
It's five weeks away for one of the most important elections in our lives.
It's one of the most important. I don't want to introduce myself, but it's a career, so I'm going from place to place struggling to get great candidates," he said.
And he continued: "We have this terrible radical group of Democrats, it's happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by all means necessary, we see wickedness, wickedness.
They don't care who they hurt or who they have to go over to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, and we're not going to give it to them."
The Democrats, he said, are embarking on a mission of "resistance and obstruction".
"We've seen him in the last four days," he said, saying that the Democrats "were angry, bad, horrible and false."
He referred to the Senate Judicial Commission appointing the Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who received the public's mouthfuls.
"Do you remember his answer?
Do you filter the document?
Mmm, Mmm, what?
No, no mmm, I expect an answer. His body language was terrible, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party already covers a wide range of views.
It's intolerant with people who say what they think
When the Momentum activists of my local party voted to censure me, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I am the last of a row of Members of the Labour Party Parliament to whom he is told he is not welcome, and only to say what we think.
My colleague from Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated like being categorically against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
I disagreed with the importance of a responsible economic policy, in the area of national security, on Europe. It was ironic that they were matters in which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
As stated in the notice of the Labour Party meeting in Nottingham East on Friday, "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
During most of the eight years in which I have been a member of the local Labour Party Parliament, that is exactly what the evening meetings of the General Committee on Fridays have been.
Unfortunately, this is not the current tone of many meetings and the promise of a "kinder and kinder" policy is already more than forgotten, if it really applied at some point.
It is increasingly clear that dissenting views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that every opinion is judged on the basis of whether the party's leaders consider it acceptable or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues I once thought shared a similar political vision began to expect him to change his opinion radically and take positions with which he would never have agreed, whether on national security or on the single EU market.
Whenever I speak in public, regardless of what I say, there is a diaphragm of insults on social networks demanding my withdrawal, denouncing the policies of the centre, telling me that I should not be in the Labour Party.
I'm not the only one who's experienced it.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, as comments about me tend to be political.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a stream of sexist or racist insults daily, but never run away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalization of insults.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn stated that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer have that wide range of opinions and, with each motion of "censorship" or every change in the rules of selection, the party becomes narrower.
Over the past two years, I have received many tips that recommended keeping my head down and not making me hear so much and so "it would be all right."
But I didn't get into politics to do that.
Since 32 years ago I joined the Labour Party as a high school student, motivated by the negligence of the Thatcher government that left my entire school classroom literally in ruins, I have tried to support the improvement of public services for those who need them most, either as a councilman or as a government minister.
I have never hidden my political ideas, nor in the last elections.
It is impossible for someone in Nottingham East to ignore my political positions or areas where I disagreed with current leaders.
The only thing I would say to those who promoted the Friday motion is that I do not understand these desires to waste time and energy with questions about my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party when the country goes head to a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and public services.
The real message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for voters, whether from the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of withdrawal or political opportunism will prevent me from acting according to what I think is best for all of you.

Ayr 38 - Melrose 17: An Invincible Ayr climbs to the top
Two essays at the end of the party may have decided to some extent the final outcome, but no doubt Ayr deserved the victory in this very entertaining party of the Tennant's Premiership day.
Now they head the table and it's the only invincible team of the ten participating.
In the end, it was the superiority of his defense, as well as his ability to make better use of the opportunities, which gave victory to the local team, so Coach Peter Murchie had every right to be content.
"We've been tested in all the parties and we're still invincible, so I have to be glad," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose commented: "Ayr deserves recognition, took advantage of opportunities better than us."
The trial of Grant Anderson in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, placed the Ayr in front; but a yellow card to Scottish captain Rory Hughes, the Warriors loan for the match, allowed Melrose to take advantage of this disadvantage of the opponent and Jason Baggot obtained an unconverted essay.
Climo extended the advantage of Ayr with a penalty. Before, just in the middle of time, he marked and converted a essay into solitary, leaving the score on 17-5 in favor of Ayr at rest.
However, the Melrose began well the second part and Patrick Anderson's essay, converted by Baggot, reduced this difference to five points.
Then there was a long interruption for a serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, to which they had to pull out on the camel, and, when the party resumed, the Ayr advanced with a trial of Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
The yellow card to Blair Macpherson, Captain of the Ayr, allowed Melrose again to take advantage of the fact that they had one more man with an unconverted trial by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of enormous pressure.
However, the premises recovered and, when the yellow card was shown to Struan Hutchinson for placarding Climo without the ball, from the penal line, MacPherson did an essay when he was at the back of the maul he was moving forward.
Climo converted it, just as he had done almost since the match was resumed, after Kyle Rowe received the ball sent by David Armstrong from a kick and sent to the Gregor Henry wing at the bottom to do with the fifth rehearsal of the premises.
The protagonist of Still Game wants to guide his career towards the restoration sector
Ford Kieran, protagonist of Still Game, seems determined to move on to the restaurant sector after it turns out that he has been appointed director of a restaurant chain.
The 56-year-old actor is Jack Jarvis in the famous BBC program, who writes and co-protagonizes with his many-year-old comedy partner, Greg Hemphilll.
The duo has announced that the ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems Kiernan is making plans for his life after Craiglang.
According to the official registry, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the matter, although a Scottish Sun source pointed out that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the "flowering restaurant market" of Glasgow.
"The sea belongs to us": a landless Bolivia has the hope that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
Sailors guard a naval headquarters in La Paz.
In public buildings they wave blue sea flags.
From Lake Titicaca to Amazonas, the naval bases show the motto: "The sea belongs to us by law,
Recovering it is a duty."
Throughout Bolivia, a land without sea, they still vividly remember the lost coast to Chile in a bloody conflict over the resources that took place in the 19th century, in addition to the longing to re-go back through the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may be the biggest in decades, as Bolivia expects an International Court of Justice resolution by 1 October, after five years of discussion.
"Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, is waiting for the result with a positive vision," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will observe the judgement of the International Court of Justice on large screens distributed throughout the country, hoping that the Hague Court will take action in favour of Bolivia's claim that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile has an obligation to negotiate to grant Bolivia a sovereign departure from the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president, who is waging a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has much to say about Monday's resolution.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in favour of Bolivia and that the situation would change little if it did so.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands has no power to award Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the decision of the International Court of Justice arrives only six months after the final allegations indicates that the case "was not complicated," said Peace Zárate, Chilean expert in international law.
Far from promoting the Bolivian cause, it may have been blocked for the past four years.
"The problem of access to the sea has been kidnapped by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
He also suggested that the belligerent rhetoric of Morales has undermined any good Chilean residual will.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to keep conversations after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making was unusually rapid.
On Monday, Bolivia will be offered "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and the possibility of "put an end to 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, would use the maritime issue as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up her right to access the Pacific Ocean," she added.
"The resolution is an opportunity to see that we have to leave the past behind."
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless it can be trusted in the United States.
Ri Yong Ho, Norwegian Foreign Minister, says his nation will never be the first to bring nuclear disarmament to an end if he cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the General Assembly of the United Nations on Saturday.
He urged the United States to fulfil the promises made during a Singapore summit among rival leaders.
His comments arrive at the time when Mike Pompeo, U.S. Secretary of State, appears to be about to resume diplomatic talks in paralyzed nuclear matters more than three months after this summit with the Kim Jong U, leader of North Korea.
Ri points out that the continuation of continued sanctions and the US opposition to a declaration ending the Korean War to submit to the north is a "chimera".
Washington is anxious to accept the statement without Pyongyang making any significant disarmament movement before.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to celebrate another summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism about Pyongyang's seriousness of renouncing an arsenal that the country probably considers as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare another summit among the representatives.
Paris fashion shows reveal the last line of huge hats that are about to land in a street of shops near you
If you want to increase your hat collection or totally protect yourself from the sun, don't look any more.
The designers of Valentino and Thom Browne presented a set of eccentric large hats for their 2019 spring summer collection on the gateway, dazzling the style of the Paris Fashion Week.
The impossible hats have flooded Instagram this summer and these designers have taken their spectacular creations to the gateway.
Valentino's most outstanding piece was a beige hat with a wide wing adorned with feathers that involved the heads of the models.
Other large additions were sandals with jewelry, a witch hat and even a pine, but are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of masked extraphalarias, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had lips sewn and remembered Hannibal Lecter more than the high seam.
One creation reminded a complete diving team, snorkeling and glasses included, while another seemed like a melted ice-cream cone.
If you like big fashion, you're lucky.
Style hunters predict that huge hats could begin to see in the shopping streets.
The big hats come with a strong foothold of "La Bomba", with a straw hat with a wingspan of more than 60 centimeters used by all, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The brand of worship behind this hat so impractical that it flooded social networks presented another great creation on the gateway: a beach bag of straw as large as the model in bather that wore it.
The dark orange rabies bag, decorated with rabies arrows and a white leather handle, was the main piece of the La Riviera collection of Jacquemus for the spring-summer season 2019 at the Paris Fashion Week.
As noted by the famous designer Luke Armitage to FEMAIL: "Next summer, I hope to see huge hats and beach bags on the commercial streets. Since the designer has had a great impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large complements."
John Edward: Language skills are fundamental to the citizens of the world
The independent educational centres in Scotland have a career of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another set of extraordinary results in the reviews that is reinforced by the individual and collective successes reaped in the fields of sport, art, music and other community projects.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these centres, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (CIS) strive to deliver the best level of service to students and parents.
The purpose of independent schools is to prepare their students to continue their higher education studies, for the career they choose and for the place they occupy as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement an adapted curriculum, it is observed that modern languages remain a popular and desirable subject in the centres.
As Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak a man in a language you understand, the message reaches his head.
If you speak to him in his tongue, his heart reaches him."
This is a powerful reminder that, if you want to establish relationships and build trust with people from other countries, you cannot depend solely on English.
If we take into account the recent results of this year's exams, we can observe that the languages are at the highest of the classification tables, being the highest rates of approval in independent schools.
A total of 68% of students studying foreign languages obtained an A, the highest grade.
Data collected from the 74 SCIS centres showed that 72% of students obtained an A in Mandarin, while 72% of those studying German, 69% of those studying French and 63% of those studying Spanish also obtained an A.
This shows that the independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages by considering them a fundamental competence that both children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
At present, as a subject, languages are considered to be at the same level as CTIM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curricula and everywhere.
A 2014 survey by the United Kingdom Employment and Skills Commission revealed that 17 % of the reasons given by employers about the difficulties they faced in filling jobs were attributed to the limited language skills.
Language skills are therefore increasingly indispensable in preparing young people for their future careers.
Possible job opportunities requiring languages are increasing, so these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career someone chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future thanks to a competition like this, which will last his whole life.
Being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will allow that person to automatically advance to competition.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov among more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75% of them did not speak any foreign language well enough to hold a conversation. It was also established that the only language spoken by a percentage of two digits, 15%, was French.
For this reason, investing in language teaching is now important for children today.
If they know several languages, especially those of developing economies, children will be equipped to have better opportunities to find quality employment.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some centres will focus on the most classic modern languages, while others will teach the languages considered most important for the United Kingdom in the face of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of a child, in independent schools you will always be able to choose from several languages provided by specialized teachers in this area.
Scotland's independent educational centres devote all their efforts to providing a learning environment that prepares children and that teams with the skills needed to succeed, whatever their future.
At present, it is undeniable that, in a global business environment, languages continue to be of vital importance to the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered " competences for international communication".
Independent schools will continue to offer these options, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
We've got to do it right.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Colleges
LeBron starts with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The expectation of fans waiting to see LeBron James debut in his first game with Los Angeles Lakers is about to end.
Luke Walton, a Lakers coach, announced that James will play the opening game of the pre-season game to be held on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it remains to be determined how many minutes it will play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton commented on the official Lakers website.
Lakers' reporter Mike Trudell posted on a tweet that James was likely to play limited minutes.
After a training session earlier this week, James was asked for his plans for the six Lakers' pre-season program.
"At this stage of my career I need pre-season games to prepare for me," he said.
Time of Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts a series of campaign meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of the five Trump scheduled meetings for the next week, including stops in locations with supporters, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote of his candidate to fill the vacancy of the pending Supreme Court, Trump intends to obtain support for the upcoming mid-term elections, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when the votes are cast in November.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how can you view it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19:00 tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can view it online via live broadcast on YouTube.
Trump is likely to comment on this week's appearances of the Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, who were challenged by allegations of inappropriate sexual conduct and have left awaiting an early Senate confirmation vote for at least a week while the FBI investigates them.
However, the main objective of this series of rallies is to help Republicans who face the November elections to take the lead.
Thus, President Trump's campaign noted that next week's five meetings aim to "encourage volunteers and supporters while Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they retain in the Senate and in the House of Representatives," says Reuters.
"Congress control is so crucial to your agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible while we enter the campaign," Reuters told a Trump campaign spokesman who did not want to give his name.
Programmed at Wheeling's Wesbanco Arena Stadium tonight's rally could attract supporters of "Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as having coverage in Pittsburgh's media," reported West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state in which he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate to the West Virginia Senate, who is being relegated to the polls.
"For Morrisey it is not a good sign that the president must come to give him a push in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: the US team demonstrates that it dares to fight to keep hope alive in front of the individual Sunday parties.
After three individual sessions, the forsomes of Saturday afternoon may be what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swaying impulse pendulum is a completely invented sport concept, but players really believe in it, even more in competitions like these.
So where would you say there's the impulse now?
"They took us six points of advantage and now they take us four, so I guess that can be considered a small impulse," Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe has an advantage, of course: four points ahead with twelve more at stake.
As Spieth points out, the Americans feel that they have some wind in their favor and reasons to be excited, among other reasons for the couple formed by Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and got three points of four each.
Spieth has been lethal from tea to green and preach by example.
Gutural shouts of celebration rose in volume as his round progressed, introducing a vital putt to tie the fourth match when he and Thomas went two down after two holes.
The putt who gave them the game in the 15th was received with a similar cry, of those who transmit that they believe that the American team has not yet stayed away.
"What needs to be done to redouble efforts and focus on the party," Spieth said.
That's what these players have done.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed history of the Ryder Cup.
The strange and adorable couple in Europe has four out of four and nothing can go wrong with them.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't do a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided the bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and in the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That crack and the way your energy flows with the boisterous public make it clear that these are the players to be defeated on Sunday, and that there will be no other players as popular as Fleetwood and Molinari to seal a possible European victory when the sun sets in Le Golf National.
Preferably, both at the same time in different holes.
Still, it is still premature to talk about European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson dispatched Sergio García, the hero of the four balls in the morning, after forming a couple with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes buried the Spanish and Swedish in a hole they couldn't get out of.
But on Sunday there will be no help to get out of the holes.
Fourballs and forsomes are fascinating to see closely because they appreciate the interactions between couples, the advice they give and those who don't, and the way a strategy can change in an instant.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and has a great advantage to face the last day, but this forsome session has also shown that the US team dares to fight, something some, especially Americans doubt.
Europe advances for 10-6 the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe leaves with a good advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup, after finishing the fourballs and forsomes with a 10-6 result on the United States.
The motivated duo composed by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the contest with two victories over a Tiger Woods who saw himself in trouble, ahead of four points in the Le Golf National ranking.
European Thomas Bjorn, trying to preserve the trophy they lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team that made many mistakes during the morning's fourballs, which ended 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the forsomes, winning two matches, but failed to shorten distances.
American Jim Furyk needs to get eight points from Sunday's 12 individual games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novelist to win four consecutive points. Besides, he and Molinari, who received the nickname "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second couple to win four points in their first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, his magnificent union served to defeat a discouraged Woods and the American novelist Bryson Decahmbeau for a round 5-4.
Woods, who in the two games on Saturday had not highlighted much, had occasional moments of brightness, but now has lost 19 of his 29 matches of fourballs and forsomes, and seven consecutive.
Justin Rose, who was resting for the morning ovenballs, became Henrik Stenson's partner in the forsomes, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, number one and number three of the world, respectively, with a result 2-1.
Although the day was pleasant and quiet in the southwest of Paris, Europe did not have it all on its own.
The three-time winner, Jordan Spieth, and Justin Thomas served as a reference to the Americans, getting two points on Saturday.
They won an exciting 2-1 victory in front of the Ian Poulter and Spanish Jon Rahm in the fourballs and then defeated Poulter and Rory McIllroy for 4-3 in the forsomes after losing the two initial holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, which a team recovers from a four-point difference in individual parties has only happened twice, although Furyk, as the trophy owner, only needs a tie to keep it.
Although they have been the best seconds for two days, it seems that carrying out a counterattack on Sunday is beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says that "there is no possibility" that they should be unilaterally disarmed first if they lack confidence
On Saturday, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea informed the United Nations that the continuation of sanctions deepened its distrust in the United States and that there was no possibility that his country would unilaterally renounce nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho declared before the annual General Assembly of the international agency that North Korea had adopted "significant measures of goodwill" over the past year, such as to stop carrying out nuclear and missile tests, dismantle nuclear testing facilities and commit to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not receive any similar response from the United States," he said.
"If we do not trust the United States, we cannot have confidence in our national security, and in those circumstances there is no possibility that we will first unilaterally disarm ourselves."
Although Ri repeated the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a phased denuclearization formula that rewards the country as it takes gradual steps, its statement is important, since it did not simply reject unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump after the first summit between an active US president and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore, when Kim committed himself to working for the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" and Trump ensured North Korea's security.
North Korea has pursued the official end of the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must renounce its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also resisted calls to soften international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States has insisted on denuclearization in the first place and has increased pressure by means of sanctions in order to achieve its purpose coercively, even by objecting to a declaration of termination of war," said Ri.
"The idea that sanctions can cause us to fall on our knees is a chemera of people who don't know us.
The problem is that the continuation of sanctions deepens our distrust."
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, announced by the US leader to the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings held between Kim and Moon Jae, South Korea's leader in the last five months, and added: "If South Korea had been the focus of denuclearization rather than the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be in such a standstill."
Even so, the tone of Ri's speech was radically different from last year's speech, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to lead North Korea's missiles to American soil after the "evil president" Trump, on a suicide mission, called Kim "a rocket man".
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in advancing towards disarmament, but said that much remained to be done and that sanctions needed to continue to be applied until North Korea became denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump stated that there was no deadline for this: "We can take two years, three years or five months, no matter."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its progress.
However, as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo informed the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The imposition of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue vigorously and without compliance until the final and fully verified denuclearization is realized".
The Security Council has unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to cut funding for the ballistic and nuclear missile programmes in Pyongyang.
Pompeo spoke with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and later commented that he would return to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, but a few hours later North Korea reported that his "requirements were those of a mobster."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States applied the "related measures".
He said Kim had told him that the "appropriate measures" he was looking for were the security assurances Trump had promised in Singapore and steps towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to rest enough
Thanks to a new course this year at Harvard University, all university students sleep more in an attempt to combat the growing machistical culture of studying all night drinking caffeine.
One professor found out that university students number one in the world usually have no idea about the basic care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard School of Medicine, and a specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital designed the course, it is believed that the first of his class in the United States.
Their motivation to start the course arose after giving a talk about how sleep deprivation affects learning.
"At the end of the course, a girl approached me and asked why she just learned about this now, in her last year.
He said no one had ever talked to him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he said to The Telegraph.
The course, delivered for the first time this year, explains the basic concepts about how good sleep habits contribute to academic and sporting performance, as well as improving general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the university, said that the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were only sleeping during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is an image of a bedroom, where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, sports shoes and books that inform them of the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on sports performance and the importance of establishing a routine to go to sleep.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, embolism, depression and cancer.
Afterwards, an icon on the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
"We know that it will not change the behavior of students instantly.
However, we believe they have the right to know, just as anyone has the right to know the health effects of smoking tobacco," added Professor Czeisler.
He said that the culture of pride for "going the night sailing" still exists and added that modern technology and the increasing pressure to which students are subjected meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Sleeping long enough and a good quality dream should be "the secret weapon" of students to fight stress, tiredness and anxiety; even to avoid gaining weight, as sleep deprivation causes the brain to create a feeling of hunger, so they want to eat all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studied chemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes the previous year in Harvard.
He pointed out that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to extend it to the entire campus.
She hoped that the next step would be to ask all graduate students to complete a similar study programme before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler's recommendation is that students think about setting an alarm to go to bed and another to wake up, and that they are aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" that emit the screens of electrical appliances and LEDs, which can alter the circadian rhythms, so they would end up having trouble sleeping.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga's goal graves Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another episode of depression out of the house, when Dolly Menga's attack drove Steven Gerrard's torn apart team to a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The people of Ibrax wanted to win their first victory out of the house since the 4-1 victory in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team defeated Gerrard's for the second time in 18 matches as a coach, leaving his team eight points from the Hearts, unpaved leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga's attack took place a few minutes before the middle of the day, and Rangers' uninspired alignment was not up at any time.
Now, the Rangers go down to the sixth position, the Livingston goes up to the third, behind the Hibernian by the difference of goals.
Rangers may encounter more problems, as the Calum Spence line judge had to receive medical assistance for a head injury after someone allegedly launched an object from the visiting background.
Gerard changed to eight of the headlines who won the party against the Ayr, entering the semifinals of the Scottish League Cup.
On the other hand, Holt pulled out the 11 players from Livingston who pulled a point out to the Hearts last week and would have been pleased by the way his very organized team drowned the opponents at all times.
The Rangers may have had more possession, but Livingston took better advantage of the ball when he had it.
They should have marked at the beginning two minutes ago, when Menga took a step into space for Scott Pittman who passed through the defense, leaving him alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder sent her out.
Keaghan Jacobs drew a deep lack for Captain Craig Halket, but his companion in the defense, Alan Lithgow, was only able to send her out through the long stick.
The Rangers regained control, but it seemed that there was more hope than conviction about their game in the last third.
There is no doubt that Alfredo Morelos felt that he had been penalized in the 15th minute of the match, when he and Steven Lawless were shocked, but referee Steven Thomson made deaf ears at the request of the Colombian.
The Rangers got two rounds to carry in the first half, but the former gatekeeper of Ibox, Liam Kelly, hardly saw himself in trouble dealing with Lassana Coulibaly's head and the boring launch of Ovie Ejaria.
Although the goal marked in the 34th minute by Livingston came against all predictions, no one can deny that they deserved it by the dedicated effort.
Again, the Rangers were unable to cope with a deep play to Jacobs standing ball.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher fit the ball for Scott Robinson, who remained calm and passed Menga to score the goal.
In the break, Gerard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, which had an almost immediate impact, as the steering wheel passed to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly left his line to block him.
Still, Livingston continued to take visitors exactly to the type of game he likes, with Lithgow and Halkett taking off one long pass after another.
Holt people could have gained more advantage in the final stages, but McGregor remained firm to reject Jacobs before Lithgow finished a head corner that did not enter.
The Rangers' replacement, Glen Middleton, called for a penalty towards the end of the game after a meeting with Jacobs, but again Thomson looked elsewhere.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page from the Almanac section of "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and CONTANDING... was born in Germany the future physical Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that culminated with the device known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter, which has since been a pillar of science, has also become a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 movie "Las bellas de Coronado", with actors Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in the seemingly incompatible roles of cowboy scientists:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It is a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
By placing your headphones, you can hear the effect of waves emitted by the radioactivity of minerals."
Evans: "It's like a radio!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, when he was about to be 63 years old.
But the invention bearing his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" the malignant cells and kill them.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells to a patient and alter them in the laboratory.
Thus, they can "see" a protein common to many cancers and reinject them.
A vaccine trial is generating promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize the malignant cells, saw how her ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells to a patient and alter them in the laboratory so they can "see" a protein common to many cancers, called HER2, and then reinject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland commented: "Our results suggest we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promotes the growth of different types of cancer", such as breast, ovary, lung or colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and "teaching" them to attack cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarked on a stage for Trump with a MAGA hat after his appearance in SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was punched in the Saturday Night Live studio after an erratic performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump, and said he would present himself to the elections in 2020.
After the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, during which he used his hat with the message Make America Great Again, he began to depot against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I often talk to someone white and ask me how I can like Trump if he's racist.
Well, if I were worried about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago," he said.
SNL started Matt Damon's sketch program in which Hollywood star ridiculed Brett Kavanaugh's statement to the Senate Judicial Committee regarding Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual assault.
Although it wasn't broadcasted, comics Chris Rock went on recording West's skirt to social media.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to ridicule West with the publication.
In addition, West told the public that he had had had a bad time behind the scenes for wearing that hat.
"They got in with me.
I was told not to go out with my hat on.
They got in with me!
And then they tell me I'm asleep," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see how sleepy I am?" and added that he "was going to put on his superman layer, because that meant no one could tell him what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try it out with love."
His comments received solicitations from the public on at least two occasions and SNL members seemed to be embarrassed, Variety reported. One person told the magazine: "The study remained completely silent."
West had been invited to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West bewildered many when he went out to the stage to sing I Love it dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: Grateful for Resisting MUCHEDUMBRE".
Karen Hunter, the host of an interview program, tweeted that West was simply "being himself and that's absolutely wonderful."
"But I decide NOT to reward someone (buying his music or clothes, or supporting his art) who I think is hugging and spreading a dangerous ideology for my community.
He's free.
We too," he added.
Before the program, the rapper announced on Twitter that his name had changed, saying that he was now "the person formerly known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name, following Diddy's steps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, Snoop Dogg has also been called Snoop Lion, without forgetting the missing music legend, Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist formerly known as Prince.
Charge of attempted murder by stabbing in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhacklove, according to the police.
The accused is expected to appear on Monday at the Belfast Trial Court.
The prosecution will review the charges.
Kit Harington, throne game star, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is famous for its role as Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series of the HBO, Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor has attacked the stereotype of the male hero, saying that these on-screen roles often convey to young boys who had to be tough to be respected.
In an interview given to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit commented that he believes that "something has gone wrong" and wondered how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his partner in Tronos Game, admitted that it seemed "very important" to him to address this issue.
"Personally, it seems quite important right now, where have we been wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What have we been teaching men as they grew up, thinking about the problems they see now?"
Kit believes that television can have part of the responsibility for increasing toxic masculinity due to its male characters.
And he continued: "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television, and on the street, that makes young people feel they have to be this concrete form of man?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time. How do we change it?
Because it is clear that something has gone wrong in the education of young people."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in any prequel or sequel of Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, claiming that he is "full of battlefields and horses".
Starting in November, Kit will feature True West, Sam Shepard's theatrical work that tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that he believes that meeting his wife Rose is the best thing he's got out of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in the series, so, in that sense, she has given me my future family and my life from now on," she said.
Rose represented Ygritte, the loving interest of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the fantastic series awarded with Emmy awards.
The couple married in June 2018 on a family farm in Leslie, Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% more than new cases
China has announced a 14 per cent increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people in the country, according to health authorities.
Only in the second quarter of 2018, some 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of these were sexually infected, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly across parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who have HIV in this way has been reduced in its entirety, declared the Chinese health authorities at a congress held in Yunnan Province.
Each year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is a serious problem in China's LGTB community.
Homosexuality was released in China in 1997, but the LGTB group suffered a lot of discrimination.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that between 70% and 90% of men who have sex with other men will end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are due to lack of adequate protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of an attempt to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of his staff leak data from Republican Party senators and asserts that it is "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, the representative Maxine Waters criticized the allegations that a member of her staff had published the personal data of three U.S. Senators of the Republican Party on Wikipedia pages on legislators.
The Democrat of Los Angeles stated that these accusations were driven by commentators and websites of "extreme right".
"False lies, lies and more vile lies," Waters commented in a Twitter post.
Reportedly, the published information included the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
On Thursday, an unknown person from the Capitol published the information on the Internet during a session of the Senate panel on allegations of inappropriate sexual conduct against Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court.
The filtration took place sometime after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the origin of the publications was associated with the Waters office and made public the data of a member of the Waters staff, according to the Capitol.
"This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal data and security have been affected as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations, was not at all responsible for leaking this information.
This baseless claim is completely false and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement elicited immediate criticism on the Internet, including those of the former press secretary of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
"Relieve this information with anger," wrote Fleischer.
"This suggests not the temperance necessary to be a member of Congress.
When someone's accused of something he hasn't done, he shouldn't be angry.
He mustn't rebel.
He must not question the defendant's motives.
It must maintain calm and serenity."
It seems that Fleischer wanted to compare the reaction of Waters with the criticisms of the Democrats to Judge Kavanaugh, whom the detractors accused of being too angry during the Thursday appearance.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who intends to break Waters in the mid-term elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's very serious," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters stated that his office had alerted “the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies of these fraudulent charges”.
"We will ensure that the authors are discovered," he continued, "and that they are legally held responsible for all these destructive and dangerous actions for all my staff members."
Criticism of Johnny English: Again in action. The parody of Rowan Atkinson's spy remains short
Now it has become a tradition to search Brexit for clues in any new film with a British approach. It seems that this is what it is appropriate to do with this new delivery of the parody franchise of action and comedy Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Returns.
Is this ironic self-satisty about how clearly insane we are the nation's new export opportunity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his eyes leaping and his inexpressive face, has renewed his license to put his foot on for the second time. Only his name already gives clues that, more than anything, it is a comic creation designed for non-English-speaking cinemaphile territories.
Of course, it is the ridiculous secret agent who, despite his strange claims to overthrow glamur, has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr. Bean and a pinch of that sort who played a single note on the theme of Firecars that was played at the London 2012 Olympics opening ceremony.
In addition, at its origin it was based on the mysterious traveling and international man represented years ago by Atkinson in Barclaycard's already forgotten television ads, sowing chaos behind him.
In this last delivery, there are one or two good moments.
I was delighted to see Johnny English approaching a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor as the propellers collided against the helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy jumps to the eye, but humor remains quite short and is strangely superfluous, especially now that franchises of "series" movies like 007 and impossible Mission add comic ingredients without problems.
Humor seems more targeted to children than to adults, and for me, Johnny English's absurd misfortunes are not as clever and accurate as Atkinson's silent jokes on Mr. Bean's role.
Now, the repeated argument today is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A computer pirate has infiltrated Britain's supersecret spy network, revealing the identities of all its active agents to the dismay of the agent in service, a unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the drop that fills the glass for the prime minister, a pompous and tied character that is seeing how its political popularity sinks: Emma Thompson gives the best of itself in this character that is almost like Theresa May, but the script does not leave much room for work.
Your intelligence advisors inform you that, as all active spies are in danger, you will have to resort to someone who is withdrawn.
That has to be the torpe Johnny English, who now teaches in a pjo school, although he gives off-official classes about how to be a secret agent: there are some good jokes, as this is a spy academy similar to that of rock school.
English is transferred to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and meets with his suffering former Bough complex, rerepresented by Ben Miller.
Now, Bough is a man married to a submarine captain, a nice paper for which Vicki Pepperdine is not sufficiently exploited.
Thus, the Batman and Robin who do things terribly wrong in His Majesty's Secret Service return to action, with the beautiful mortal woman Ophelia Bulletova, represented by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is falling into the dangerous claws of a multimillionaire charismatic world of technology that claims that it can solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of absurd situations: they dress up as waitresses, set fire to an elegant French restaurant, expose the chaos hiding in the luxurious yacht of Volta; in addition, English becomes pure anarchy by trying to use a virtual reality helmet to familiarize itself with the interior of the house of Volta.
Definitely, they were used in depth in that last sequence, but, as funny as it may be, the whole continues to convey a somewhat childish feeling.
A fairly regular product.
Like Johnny English's other films, I couldn't help wondering if the British film industry couldn't give Rowan Atkinson a role that would make his talent real justice.
The Labour Party denies that it is drawing up a plan for the British to work four days a week, but it covers five
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn is going to think of a radical plan with which the British would work four days a week, but they would charge five.
Supposedly, the party wants the owners of the companies to assign the savings obtained thanks to the artificial intelligence revolution (IA) to the workers, giving them an additional day off.
Thus, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend for the same salary.
According to sources, the idea "would fit" in the plans and economic agenda of the party to tilt the country to the benefit of the workers.
This shift to a week of four days has received the support of the Congress of Trade Unions, as it is a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
As a senior Labour Party official commented on The Sunday Times: The announcement of a revision of the directive is expected by the end of the year.
"It will not be achieved overnight, but the four-day workweek is definitely a matter the party hopes to incorporate to rebalance the economy for the worker, as well as in the overall industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such ideas, since the Green Party has already promised a four-day work week in its 2017 general election campaign.
However, for the moment, not the entire Labour Party supports this decision.
A Labour spokesperson said: "The four-day workweek is not part of the party's policy and is not going to be discussed at this time."
The shadow Finance Minister, John McDonnell, used the Labour Party conference that was held last week to expose his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was willing to recover powers from "anonymous directors" and "acquired" from companies providing public services.
The Minister's plans in the shadow also include the idea that current shareholders of water companies do not recover all their participation, as a labor government could apply deductions corresponding to perceived irregularities.
It also confirmed its intention to include workers in business management councils and to create inclusive ownership funds in which 10 % of private sector companies' shares should be allocated to employees, which would result in annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk in "60 Minutes" about the FBI's investigation around Kavanaugh and if they could make them change their mind
The FBI's investigation into allegations made against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote at least one week for his confirmation as Supreme Court judge, and also raises the question whether the outcome could influence any Republican senator who finally decides to withdraw his support.
In an interview to be held on Sunday, the 60-minute journalist Scott Pelley asked Republican senators. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham are talking about whether the FBI could bring out information that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"Of course," Kennedy said.
"I was in favour of proceeding with the hearing, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after all this had happened, had the claim come out and asked him, 'Did you do it?'
He showed himself firm, resolute, heavy."
Graham's vote, however, seems unmovable.
"I have already made a decision around Brett Kavanaugh and would overlook the accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett flatly denied it," Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of the people she has named have been able to confirm it.
36 years ago.
It's always the same, I don't see anything new in this case."
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Have you been able to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival, where there is an impressive poster of stars for an equally impressive mission: to end poverty in the world.
This year, in its seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see how tens of thousands of people will travel to the Great Lawn of Central Park to enjoy performances such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the real objective of the event: to end extreme poverty in 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international awareness-raising group that expects to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
If you want to receive a free entry for the event (unless you can pay a VIP entry), concert attendees have had to complete a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteers, send emails to a world leader, make a phone call or anything else that serves to raise awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
However, what has the Global Citizen achieved at the age of 12 to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding with a free concert a genuine way to persuade people to take measures or is it just a form of the so-called "clichtivism", which is called the stance we take when we think we are doing something really useful when signing an online request or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters in favour of a large number of diverse objectives.
As a result of these actions, they claim that world leaders have been able to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will have an impact on the lives of more than 2250 million people in 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements that emerged from their actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that guaranteed funds have directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Among the most important commitments is "The Power of Nutrition", an association of UK-based investors and executives united with the common commitment to "help children grow up and develop with their full potential." To this end, it has been proposed to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end the country's malnutrition after receiving more than 4700 tweets from Global Citizens' collaborators.
"Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens' collaborators like you, we can mark a small milestone in the history of social injustice of malnutrition," Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of "The Power of Nutrition", told the crowd during a concert in April 2018 in London.
The group also stated that, having carried out more than 5000 actions to try to improve nutrition in the United Kingdom for mothers and children, the government announced the financing of a project, Power of Nutrition, with which 5 million women and children will benefit from nutrition-related interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on your website about what we believe can be done to remedy extreme poverty,
a Global Citizen collaborator replied: "It will be a long and hard road and, on many occasions, we will stumble and fall.
But, as the human rights movements have already achieved before and against apartheid, we will achieve our goals, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae are some of the performances we will be counting on at this year's New York event, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use the Navy to carry out the blockade on Russia's energy exports - Secretariat of the Interior
"If necessary," Washington could turn to its Navy to prevent Russian energy from shaking markets, including the Middle East, revealed US Secretary of Interior Ryan Zinke, as published in Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's alliance with Syria, in particular where it operates at legitimate government level, is merely a pretext for expanding in new markets.
"I am convinced that they are in the Middle East to negotiate with energy, as they do with Eastern Europe, becoming the supplier most south of Europe," he said.
Furthermore, according to official information, there are ways and methods to address this issue.
"The United States, with its Navy, has the capacity to ensure that the sea lanes remain open and, in the case, could even block them to ensure that energy does not end in the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the people who attended an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that is defined as the "voice of energy consumer" in the United States.
In it, he compared the approaches Washington maintains in its negotiations with Russia and Iran, and warned that they are, in fact, the same.
"The economic alternative in Iran and Russia is basically to take advantage of and replace fuels," he warned at the same time that Russia can only do one thing, which is to base its economy on fossil fuels.
These statements are made when the Trump administration has been trying to boost the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe and to take account of its role in Russia, which is the cheapest option for European consumers.
For this purpose, Trump administration members, including Donald Trump himself, try to persuade Germany to abandon the "unappropriate" Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which, according to Trump, will turn Berlin into a hostage in Moscow.
Moscow has at all times insisted that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which reaches a value of $11 billion, is intended to double the current capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's fierce opposition to the project responds only to economic reasons and is a further demonstration of unfair competition.
"I think we all share the idea that energy cannot become a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," said Russia's Minister of Energy, Aleksandr Novak, after holding a meeting with Rick Perry, the US Secretary of Energy last September in Moscow.
The US position has, however, been met with Germany's rejection, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The organisation leading the industry in Germany, the German Industry Federation (BDI), has asked the US not to intervene in EU energy policy or bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"It's a big problem when a third state interferes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, director of the German Industry Federation (BDI) after a meeting recently held between the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will carefully analyse the possibility of becoming a candidate for the presidency in 2020, says the Senator of Massachusetts
Senator by Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would consider joining the presidential career after the mid-term elections.
During an appearance at the City Hall of Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that this challenge was being raised.
"It is time for women to come to Washington to amend our broken government and finally to have women among the leaders," said The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will seriously raise the possibility of applying for the presidency."
Warren gave his opinion on President Donald Trump during an appearance at the City Hall and stated that "he was taking the country the wrong way."
"I am really concerned about the damage Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren spoke without slaps about Trump and his Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet last Friday, Warren said that "it is absolutely necessary for the FBI to investigate what happened before the vote."
On Thursday, a survey was published in which, however, a majority of Warren's own voters did not believe that they should present themselves for the 2020 elections.
58% of Massachusetts voters claimed that the senator should not be presented, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe survey.
A 32 per cent of respondents did, however, support their candidacy.
The survey expressed greater support for the former governor, Deval Patrick, with 38% support for a possible candidacy and 48% against.
Other recognized members of the Democratic Party spoke about the possible candidacy by 2020 of former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide officially in January, according to the Associated Press agency.
Sarah Palin talks about post-traumatic stress disorder of Track Palin at a Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
Last Monday night, he was arrested and accused of domestic violence.
"The situation that is going through my son, for everything that has happened since he came back, is well known by other families who suffer the effects of TEPT and other injuries that our soldiers return with," he told the public that he gathered in a rally in favor of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to this arrest as the great taboo no one wants to talk about, and commented on his son and other war veterans who "return with a different, hardened behavior, wondering whether there really is such respect for what their fellow soldiers and airmen, as well as all other members of the army, have given their country."
Monday was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, accused of an episode of domestic violence towards a woman, who interferes with a complaint of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the effects of drugs or alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla police department.
18 states, D.C. support the challenge of achieving a new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia support a judicial appeal to the new United States policy to deny asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence or gang violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the district presented a "friendly" writing on Friday in Washington to show their support for an asylum seeker who faces the current directive, NBC News reported.
The applicant's full name has not been revealed in the "Grace v. Sessions" case that presented in August the U.S. Civil Liberties Union (ACLU, American Civil Liberties Union) against federal policy.
He said his partner "and his children, who are members of a violent gang," abused her, but U.S. officials denied his asylum application on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers representing these states defending Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of applications for asylum to the United States, as nations facing widespread problems related to domestic violence and gang violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Migration Appeals Board (BIA) whereby undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence could apply for asylum in this country.
Columbia District Attorney General Karl Racine made statements on Friday, stating that the new policy "ignores decades of international, federal and state law".
"According to federal law, all asylum applications must be failed by virtue of particular facts and circumstances of demand and, instead, this exception infringes that principle," the Amicus curiae states.
In addition, lawyers indicated in the letter that the policy that denies entry to immigrants harms the US economy by claiming that they tend to become entrepreneurs more often and "assume a necessary workforce".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"People who leave their countries of origin for reasons of persecution or threats by race, religion, nationality or belonging to a social group or particular political opinion may seek asylum," said Sessions when it announced this directive on 11 June.
Asylum has never been created as a measure to alleviate all problems, not even all serious problems, facing people throughout the world on a daily basis.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu while increasing the number of deaths in a race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation was getting worse and worse.
"The situation is very tense," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, while trying to comfort her baby with fever in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute ambulances arrive with more bodies.
And clean water is scarce."
Some residents have returned to their destroyed homes to search among the few annexed belongings left in an effort to recover what is possible for them.
There are hundreds of injured people and hospitals, also damaged because of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, are flooded.
Some of the wounded; among them, Dwi Haris, who had his back and a broken shoulder, rested outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated outside the building due to the continuous replicas, also very strong.
He couldn't help crying when he told us about the violent earthquake he experienced while he was on the 5th floor of the hotel with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to get safe.
I got caught in the remains of the ruined wall, I think," told Haris to Associated Press. He and his family were in the city to celebrate a wedding.
"I heard my wife ask for help and then a tremendous silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're okay."
US ambassador accuses China of "bullying" with "propagandistic announcements"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page announcement in an American newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread its propaganda.
Last Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump referred to the pay supplement of China Daily at the Des Moines Register, Iowa's most-selling newspaper, after accusing China of wanting to interfere in the elections to the United States Congress on 6 November, something China firmly denies.
Trump's accusation of Beijing's attempt to influence the U.S. elections marked what US officials indicated to Reuters as a new phase in a growing Washington campaign to pressure China.
While it is customary for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote their trade activities, Beijing and Washington are currently blocked in a growing trade war that has led them to increase their import levels by both sides.
China's compensatory tariffs applied to the beginning of the trade war were thought to fall on exporters from states such as Iowa, who supported the Trump Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and the former governor of Iowa, who is one of the leading exporters of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and entrepreneurs.
According to Branstad in an opinion paper at the Des Moines Register on Sunday, China "is further intensifying that pressure with advertisements published in our free press."
"To try to spread its propaganda, the government of China avails itself of the precious American tradition of freedom of expression and free press by trying to publish a payment announcement at the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the other hand, in the street kiosk where we are here in Beijing, there are only a few conflicting voices and no real reflection of the differing views that people in China can have on the worrying path that is taking the economy of their country, as the media are controlled by the strong pressure of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most relevant newspapers in China eluded the offer to publish" his article, although it did not specify what newspaper it was about.
Analysts point out that Republicans are moving away from women before the half-legislature vote with the Kavanaugh debacle
As many well-known Republicans are closing ranks in favour of the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh in the face of the various allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that there can be a backlog, especially on the part of women, in the forthcoming parliamentary elections.
The emotions surrounding this fact have been very intense and there are many Republicans who have expressed that they want to move forward with the vote.
"In this kind of business it is not possible to go back," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, at The Hill in an article that was published on Saturday.
Reeher stated that the last attempt by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to stand in favour of the FBI's investigation is sufficient to calm the disgruntled voters with this matter.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget it either tomorrow or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the Washington newspaper, D.C.
On Friday morning, the protesters who gathered at the doors of the Senate chanted "November is coming!" (November will come soon!) at the time when the Republicans who controlled the Judicial Committee decided to proceed with Kavanaugh's candidacy, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats comes out of every prediction," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, to the news site.
"People say that the impact is already very relevant and indeed so.
But it could be even greater, especially among the undecided women in the outlying neighborhoods and younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who do not usually vote even if they do not like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony in which he had in full detail his allegations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts indicated that there could be a backlog if the Republicans continued with confirmation.
"This matter has become a big mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"It is no longer just a matter of the committee vote or the final vote, not even if they sit on the bench at Kavanaugh; it is also the way the Republicans have handled all this and how they have treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of the US Priorities (a group that helps in the election of Democrats).
However, Americans seem to be divided; they don't know who they should believe after the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, but it is a few more who stand on the side of the latter.
In a new YouGov survey, it is indicated that 41% of respondents definitely or probably believe Ford's testimony, while 35% claim to believe Kavanaugh definitively or likely.
In addition, 38 % said that he thought that Kavanaugh had lied during his testimony, and 30% said the same thing about Ford.
After Flake's push, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's statements, as well as at least those of another complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judicial Commission last week and indicated that Kavanaugh raped her while she was drunk at the age of 17.
For his part, Ramirez claimed that the Supreme Court candidate showed him his genitals at a party when he studied in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that tries to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is the latest technology legend project. A company based on Berners-Lee's Solid Open Source Platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people will have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is to "dominate the world".
"It has to be now," he said about the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology so users can create their own "on-line personal data storage" or a POD.
It may contain lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in a browser and at the same time.
Something that is exclusive in personal online data storage is that the user is the one who completely decides who can access what kind of information.
The company calls it "personal capacity through data".
Inrupt's idea, according to the company's CEO John Bruce, is to incorporate resources, processes and skills needed so Solid can reach everyone.
At the moment, the company is made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that purchased IBM, some of the developers included in the template that were hired to work in the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technological developers around the world could create their own decentralized apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether or not you will introduce a radical change where all your business models are completely modified from one day to another.
"We won't ask for permission."
In a publication in Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote about Inrupt that "his mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new Solid website".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when it founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has played a very influential role in the debate on net neutrality.
Despite launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this next era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The clergyman who won a Victoria Cross in World War I · Global Voices
The only clergyman of the Church of England who won a Victoria Cross during World War I as a fighter was honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann obtained this award on September 29, 1918 in the attack by Bellenglise and Lehaukort.
However, one sniper killed him four days later and never knew that he had been granted the greatest British military honor.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren discovered a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of them, Michael Vann, said it was "of a special symbolism" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after the battle that earned the decoration to his grandfather.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a thick fog and under the intense fire of machine guns and cannons".
Then he ran to the line of fire and, with the "greater courage", advanced the line before reaching a cannon with one hand and overthrowing three of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, only a month after the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "so great that I could never reach his height, but they were very encouraging."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposited a crown of flowers after the parade, which featured the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "it was a privilege for him to be part of the parade" and added that "the value of a true hero remains evident when he is shown such a great support."
MMA followers were awake all night for the Bellator 206, but only saw Peppa Pig
Imagine that you stay awake all night to see the entire Bellator 206 so that in the end you won't be allowed to see the main event.
The San José poster had 13 fights, six included on the main card, and in the UK was going to broadcast live at night on Channel 5.
At 6:00 p.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were getting ready to face it, the UK viewers were surprised when the program changed Peppa Pig.
Some were not surprised after having had to stay awake until the first hour of the morning just to see the fight.
One follower on Twitter described the change to cartoons as "a heavy joke."
"There is a government regulation that regulates the content that is issued from 6:00 p.m. and this was not appropriate, so they had to change to children's programming," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's Senior Vice President of Marketing and Communication, when we asked him about the transmission.
"Peppa the pig," yes."
Bellator's president, Scott Coker, said they're going to modify the program to include British viewers in the upcoming editions.
"When I think about the broadcast option, I think it can work," Coker said.
"But it's at 6 a.m. on Sunday, so we couldn't do it until Sunday at our time, which would be Monday for them.
We're watching how to do it.
Believe me, when the programming changed, a lot of messages were received and not everyone was kind, precisely.
We tried to fix it because at first we thought it was a technical problem.
But that was not the case, it was a government problem.
I can promise it won't happen next time.
We will reduce it to five fights instead of six, which are the ones we have normally done. We try to offer more than usual so that the fans were happy and we pass.
It's a very unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality
The Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to the rest because of his sexuality, although this was, in turn, what motivated him to become a winner.
At the age of 24, he told us he didn't realize until he got to high school that "not everyone was like me."
In the first program of Desert Island Discs of Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said that his intention to talk about gay rights was to convey "hope" to other people.
He also told us that becoming a father made it begin to take on the importance of winning the Olympics.
The usual presenter of this mythical program, Kirsty Young, will be absent a few months by illness.
In the first program of Laverne, Daley, who showed himself as a marginalized, commented that he felt "below" to the rest during his childhood, because "you didn't socially accept that you liked boys and girls."
He said, "To this day, that feeling of inferiority and being different has been what has really given me the power and the strength to triumph."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he did not disappoint when he finally discovered his sexuality.
The winner of two bronze medals in the Olympics has become a prominent profile of the LGBT movement and its image has been used in this year's Commonwealth Games held in Australia to claim that more countries release homosexuality.
He said he told it because he felt fortunate to live in freedom, without reprisals, and wanted to convey that "hope" to others.
The three times world champion declared that for him it was also a surprise to fall in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married last year with the winner of an Oscar, who took him 20 years, although he specified that the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you live so much since you were so young" (I went to her first Olympic Games at 14 years of age and her father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find someone of the same age who has been through the same tall and low as you.
The couple had a son in June whom they called Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said their "global perspective" had changed.
"If they had asked me last year, all the answers would have turned around 'I have to win a gold medal'," he said.
"But you know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is undoubtedly Robbie."
Her son is called his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 years after a brain cancer was diagnosed.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he was going to die and, in fact, one of the last things he asked is whether they had the passes to London 2012, because he wanted to be in the front line.
"I couldn't tell you I wasn't going to be in the front row," he said.
"He had his hand among mine when he stopped breathing and it wasn't until that precise moment when he stopped breathing and died that I realized he wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"At that time I knew that was what I had dreamed my whole life: competing in the pool in front of me in the Olympic Games, there was nothing better," she said.
This fact was also the one that inspired him to choose his first song, Proud of Heather Small, which accompanied him in the preparation phase of the Olympic Games. He was still wearing his hen skin.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, in low form, stayed on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when playing his 47th Ryder Cup match, but you will have to reverse its shape if you want to avoid becoming a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who played the event every two years to get a record for the 12th time, was released by Captain Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and forsomes.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as so many times has done for the United States, the five-time champion of major tournaments had to settle to cheer up at some point and, in others, try to perfect their game in the field and thus be able to rectify what afflicts him.
Never the most direct of the drivers, not even at the highest moment of their career, the 48-year-old player is not in his best way for the Le Golf National field, where the long rush punishes continuously with wrong blows.
And if the field is no longer discouraging enough, Mickelson, in the ninth game of Sunday, faces the brilliant champion of British Open, Francesco Molinari, who has joined debutant Tommy Fleetwood to win the four matches they played this week.
If the Americans, which were four points below the beginning of the 12 individual matches, started in an impressive way, Mickelson's party could have been decisive.
Furyk showed confidence in his partner, nor could he say much more.
"He perfectly understood the role he had today, slapped me in the back and, surrounding me with his arm, said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"You have a lot of confidence in yourself.
He's in the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to these teams before and this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing two games.
I thought they would be more, but that's how it came out, and that's how we thought it had to be.
He wants to be there, like the rest."
On Sunday, Mickelson will overcome Nick Faldo's brand of more Ryder Cup games played.
It could be the last of a whole Ryder Cups trajectory that had never clearly matched the levels of its individual brand.
Mickelson has 18 cattle, 20 lost and 7 equals, although Furyk said his presence contributed many more intangible values to the team.
"It's fun, sarcastic, ingenious, he likes to make fun of others; it's great to have him on the team," he explained.
"I think the younger players have loved to have it as support, too this week; it was fun.
It provides much more than just game."
The European captain, Thomas Bjorn, knows that leadership can disappear very soon
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows very well that although you enter with a substantial advantage in the last days of the Ryder Cup, it can easily become an uncomfortable tournament.
The Danish made its debut at the 1997 Valderrama match, where a band captained by Seven Ballesteros maintained a five-point advantage over the Americans, but in the end only managed to finish the others by weighing their heels for a minimum margin, winning 1411⁄2-131/2.
"Don't stop remembering that we did a great tournament in Valderrama; we also did it in Brookline and lost, we did it in Valderrama and won, but for very little," Bjorn said, portrayed, after seeing the generation of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday lead it with a 10-6 in Le Golf National.
History will teach me and everyone that that team is not finished.
You have to give it all morning.
Get out there and do what you have to do.
This doesn't end until the points are on the marker.
We have a goal to achieve, which is to win this trophy, and that's the only thing we have to think about.
I say it all the time, I focus on the 12 players in our team, but we are very aware of what is on the other side where they are, no more or less, than the best players in the world."
Proud of what your players have done in a very tough golf course, Bjorn added: "I would not want to advance.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
What prevails tomorrow are individual actions and this is different.
It's great to share what happens with a partner when things go well, but when you're there alone, you test your full capacity as a golfer.
That's the message that players have to deliver, get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now it's time to put aside your partner, go and get the best of yourself."
In front of Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will try to make his players do better individually than they did as a couple, being the exceptions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points of four.
Furyk himself has been on both ends in the last days of those great tournaments and has been part of the team he won in Brookline and then ended up losing when Europe carried out the "Miracle of Medina".
"I remember every word," he told us when we asked him how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, managed to motivate his players on the last day.
"We have 12 super important matches tomorrow, but we have to start as well as we did on Brookline, as you saw in Medina.
When we all move in one direction, all the pressure falls on those intermediate parties.
We defined our strategy and brought them out with the feeling that we were going to try to do something magical tomorrow."
Thomas is assigned the task of trying to lead the fight and confront Rory McIllroy in the main party, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans on the second half of the list.
"I went with this group of boys in this order because I think they cover the entire tour," Bjorn said about their individual selections.
The new German warship, postponed again
The new German Navy frigate should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the old ships of the Cold War era, but it will not be done until at least the year coming due to defective systems and the progressive increase of costs, reported local media.
The delivery of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the boat leading the new frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class, has now postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper a statement by a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the problems that arose after delivery bothered the completion of the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class that applied for the Navy in 2007 will replace the old frigates of the Bremen class.
We know that they will include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-ships missiles, as well as some invisibility technologies, such as radar signals, infrared and very small acoustics.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, so that they can be deployed up to two years away from ports of origin.
However, the continuous delays have led to the fact that the innovative ships (which were supposed to allow Germany to project its power in the overseas sea) will already be outdated when they start to serve, says Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate occupied headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into operation and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It's been the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a shipyard after its delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the return, but the German media cited a number of crucial "software and hardware flaws" that left the ship virtually useless if sent to a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly important, as the ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be operated by a crew of some 120 sailors: half of the personnel that were in the old frigates of the Bremen class.
It was also found that the ship has excessive weight, which reduces its performance and limits the capacity of the Navy to add future updates.
It is believed that the "Rheinland-Pfalz" of 7,000 tons is twice as heavy as other similar class ships used by Germans in World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the price of the entire project, including crew training, has also been a problem.
It is believed that it has reached the €3100 million (3600 million), instead of the initial €2200 billion.
The problems awarded to the new frigates are of particular relevance in the light of recent warnings on the reduction of German naval power.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament Defence Committee, recognized that the Army is "deploymenting without ships".
The officer said that the problem has worsened over time, because the old ships were discharged, but have not been replaced with others.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates were able to join the Navy.
National Trust spies on the secret life of bats
This new research, which has been carried out in a state of the Scottish Highlands, tries to find out how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
Everything that is found is expected to shed more light on the behaviour of the only flying mammals and help guide the next conservation activities.
The study, carried out by the National Trust for Scotland, will follow the common bats and sopranos, as well as the Daubenton river bats and long-eared browns of the gardens of Inverewe in Wester Ross.
Special tape recorders will be placed in strategic locations of the property to track the activities of bats during the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile investigations with portable detectors.
Experts will analyze the sounds collected in the recordings to discover the frequency of bat calls and what species they do.
A report and habitat map will then be produced to create a detailed picture of the environment and its behavior.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor for NTS, expects the results to reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of grasslands and how forests should be maintained for bats and other associated species.
The bat populations in Scotland and the United Kingdom have declined considerably in the last century.
They are under threat from the construction and development that affects their nests and the loss of their habitat.
Wind turbines and electric wiring can also pose a risk to them, as well as insecticides and other chemical treatments of building materials or attacks of domestic cats.
The bats aren't really blind,
but because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes to achieve their goal.
They use a sophisticated ecolocation technique that locates ants and obstacles on their flight route.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes the topic of bats very seriously.
It has ten experts trained in this field, who regularly conduct surveys, nest inspections and sometimes rescues.
The organization has even inaugurated the first and only reserve dedicated to Scottish bats in the state of Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species of Scottish bats.
The property manager, David Thompson, says it is the ideal territory for them.
"Here, in Three, we have a fantastic area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and all the proper habitat.
However, there are still many unknown things about bats, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us better understand what they need to develop."
It stresses the importance of checking whether there are bats before carrying out maintenance tasks within the properties, since an colony of offspring can be accidentally destroyed and 400 females and offspring could be killed, which would mean eliminating a whole local population.
The bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, harass them or disturb them, as well as destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish officer in charge of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to cooperate.
He said, "We still have a lot to learn about bats and many other species that we don't know how their populations evolve."
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape at the same time as his lawyers pursue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has categorized rape complaints as "fake news", and says that people "want to meet" at the expense of his name.
His lawyers have been instructed to report to the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which was where the statements were published.
In front of Portugal and Juventus, an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga was accused of rape at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He was accused of having paid $375,000 to cover up the incident, as Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
With a video of Instagram Live that has already accumulated 142 million followers a few hours after the news was published, Ronaldo, aged 33, hit the report as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false," says the five-time winner of the Golden Ball looking at the camera.
"They only want publicity at the expense of my name.
It's the same story as ever.
They want to make themselves famous by just mentioning me, but that's how I can't help it.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel for the allegations that have appeared in what they have called "an inadmissible reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy," Reuters reports.
Counsel Christian Schertz said that the player will seek compensation for "moral damages for a amount corresponding to the gravity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of his personal rights in recent years."
It seems that the alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a night club, Ronaldo and Majorga reportedly went to the player's room and there he allegedly raped her annually, according to the documents recorded at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Majorga stated that Ronaldo kneeled after the alleged incident and told him that he was in a "99 percent" "good boy" and that he had let him down that "one percent" remaining.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex but was allowed.
Majorga also claims that he went to the police and took photographs of the injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because he had "terror in retaliation" and was concerned "to be humiliated in public."
The 34-year-old woman claims that she is trying to cancel the agreement, since she is still traumatized by the facts.
When the alleged aggression occurred, Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United and this summer he changed to Juve, a large Italian football for a €100 million contract.
Brexit: UK would always regret losing car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would "repent all its life" if it lost its position as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit," said Industry Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "disquieting" that Toyota UK would inform the BBC that, if Britain left the EU without an agreement, production would temporarily stop at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer stated that the impact of the delays in customs in the case of a Brexit without agreement could lead to the loss of jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures the Auris and Avensis models of Toyota, produced some 150 000 cars last year, of which 90% was exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that, if Britain breaks up with the EU at the end of March, there will be production stops in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers have shown their fears regarding EU exit without an agreement, especially in relation to cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says he will close his Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are about the problems that might arise in assembly chains in the case of a Brexit without agreement.
Toyota's production line is based on the adjusted production mode ("just in time" or at the last minute), where the parts arrive every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers to manufacture cars by charge.
If on 29 March the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without an agreement, there could be an interruption at the border which, according to the sector, could lead to delays and the supply of parts.
For Toyota it would be impossible to accommodate the amount of material equivalent to more than one inventory day on his Derbyshire plant, said the company and, in that case, the production would stop.
Mr. Clark said that Theresa May's Czechers plan, where future relations with the EU are established, is "precisely calibrated to avoid such controls on border crossings".
"We need an agreement. We want to have the best deal that not only allows us to get out of the passage right now but we have to take advantage of the opportunity," he said in BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The evidence from Toyota, among many other manufacturers, is that we have to be able to continue with what so far has been a tremendously successful supply chain."
Toyota has not been able to say for how long production would be stopped, but warned that in the long term the added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately the costs.
Peter Tsouvalaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the head of the United Union on the plant, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "According to my experience, once these jobs are lost, they never recover."
One government spokesman said: "We have put in place a precise and convincing plan delimiting our future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could "be back another week," as the dispute over the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continued, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating interference in the Russian elections, links between Trump's aid to Russia, and a possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Expectation before Trump decides to fire the Deputy Attorney General or not and thereby compromise Mueller's independence has fuelled Washington's quota for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein recorded the conversations he had with Trump with a microphone he himself was carrying to try to relegate to the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied it was true.
However, last Monday he went to the White House, among news that he was about to give up.
Instead, a meeting with Trump (which was then at the United Nations in New York) was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would rather not fire Rosenstein but the meeting had to postpone to avoid a conflict with the hearing of the U.S. Senate Judicial Committee in which Kavanaugh and one of the women accused of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
Friday Trump asked the FBI to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh for a week, although this would mean delaying the vote of the Senate plenary.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Sunday at Fox News.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, he said: "No date has been defined, it could be this week or another could be postponed, considering everything that is happening with the Supreme Court.
We'll decide on the march and I'll report to the press, as I do."
Some journalists would refute that statement: Sanders has not conducted any press conference in the White House since 10 September.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked what the reasons were.
Sanders said that the shortage of press wheels was not due to an aversion to TV journalists who act with grandioseness, although he said: "I will not disagree with the fact that they boast."
Then she suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president conducts more questions and answers than any other president prior to him," he said, while quoting without proof: "We have contrasted those numbers."
Press tires will continue to take place, Sanders said, "but if the press has the option to ask the President of the United States directly, I think it's a lot better than doing them to me.
We have tried to do it many times and you have seen us do it many times in the past few weeks, so that this would replace a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump usually answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public meetings or press conferences with the dignitaries who visit him.
Press conferences with him only happen on very rare occasions.
In fact, this week, in New York, the president demonstrated why it was so, where he made an unfated appearance and, at times, bizarrely before the journalists who were gathered there.
The Secretary of State for Health writes EU workers from NHS Scotland about their fears about Brexit
The Secretary of State of Health has written to the EU staff working at the Scottish HHS to express the country's gratitude and its desire to continue with them after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter only six months before the United Kingdom withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to covering the cost of citizenship applications for EU members working in public services that are not dependent on central power.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union have continued on the way out which she chose to make the decisions expected this fall.
However, the UK government has also stepped up preparations around a possible scenario where there was no agreement.
I know all this must be very disconcerting for you.
That is why I should like to reiterate now how much I value the contribution of each of the staff, regardless of their nationality.
Professionals throughout the EU and other countries provide valuable experience and many skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, from which the patients and communities we serve benefit.
Scotland is, without doubt, your home and we would love to continue counting on you."
Christion Abercrombie is operating urgently after a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, player of Tennessee State Tigers, was surgically intervened after having suffered a head injury last Saturday, when they lost 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ del Tennessee.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed informed journalists that the injury occurred shortly before the break.
"I came to the band and collapsed right there," Reed said.
Both coaches and medical personnel administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the band line before placing it on a stretcher and taking it to a thorough examination.
A member of the Tennessee State staff told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the operation at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there were no details about the type of injury yet or the damage caused" and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when it happened.
Abercrombie, redshirt sophomore, is playing in his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five tackles on Saturday before leaving the camp, with whom he joined a total of 18 throughout the season.
Foreigners shall be taxed on a higher income tax when buying a property in the United Kingdom
Foreigners will be charged a higher income tax when they purchase a property in the United Kingdom and the extra money collected under this measure will be used to provide shelter to the "no-ceiling" according to the new Conservative plans
The change will neutralize the success of Corbyn's offensive to attract younger voters
The increase in farm transfer tax shall be imposed on persons who are not paying taxes in the United Kingdom
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year to be used for the "no roof"
The additional money raised by the increase in the tax on the transmission of farms to foreign buyers of properties in the United Kingdom will be used for aid to "no roof", today announced Theresa May.
The measure is understood as an attempt to neutralize the success that Jeremy Corbyn is reaping with his promises of providing more affordable housing to attract younger voters and harassment those with higher incomes.
The increase in income tax will be imposed on people and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom and that money will be used to encourage government policy to combat the problem of begging in the streets.
The charge, which is a supplement to the current transmission tax, also includes the increase in levels introduced two years ago on second-hand housing and the "buy-to-let" system, could be up to 3%.
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year with this change.
It is estimated that 13 % of London's new construction properties are purchased by people who are not resident in the United Kingdom, which leads to higher prices and makes it difficult for people who buy for the first time to access affordable housing.
Many of the country's most wealthy areas (especially in the capital) have become "phantom cities" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy came just a few weeks after Boris Johnson claimed a reduction in transmission tax in order to help young people buy their first home.
He accused the big builders of maintaining very high prices in the properties by buying avidly land without intending to use it and urged Ms. May to eliminate the quotas that apply to affordable housing to solve the "poor housing problem" in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a number of very attractive housing reforms, including rental controls and the end of unwarranted evictions.
It also proposes to give local authorities more powers to build new housing.
Ms. May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my position as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream of improving the life of every new generation.
And that means solving the housing market, which is so devastated.
Great Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be that people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as foreign companies, can buy homes more easily than the British working class.
The dream of having a house has become something too difficult to reach for many people and the humiliation of having to sleep on the street remains too real."
Jack Ross: "My primary goal is to direct Scotland"
Sunderland's coach says his "primary goal" is to become a Scottish coach at some point.
The Scottish, 42-year-old, is excited about the possibility of revitalizing the Northeast Club, which currently occupies the third place in the League One (the third league division of England), three points from the first.
He passed to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premier the last season.
"I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
But I only got a B hat," told Ross at Sportsound at BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up seeing Scotland in Hampden with my father when I was a child and it's something that has always made me want to come back.
That opportunity will only become a reality, however, if I succeed in running a club."
Ross' predecessors as leader of the Sunderland include Dick Advvocat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former manager of Alloa Athletic says that he felt no fear when he passed such names established in such a large club, after rejecting proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At this point, the success for me is measured by whether I can return this club to the Premier League,
because the structure and facilities of this club certainly correspond to those of the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get it, but I could only consider that I've achieved my goal here when I can return to the club where it should be."
Ross has only been practicing as a coach for three years, after being a temporary assistant in Dumbarton and a 15-month period in the technical body of Hearts.
Later, he helped Alloa recover from the descent into the third division and made St. Mirren go from being on the edge of the descent to winning the championship the following season.
In fact, Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever before during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"Probably it was a real crossroads," he recalled in reference to when he took care of the Alloa.
"I always thought management was the best thing I could do, much more than play.
It may sound weird, because it was good, I could make a very good living with it and enjoy some epic moments.
But playing can be very hard.
You have to face a lot of things every week.
I still suffer from the stress and pressure of that work; however, in the direction I feel good.
I always wanted to train and now I've managed to do it, it's the time of my adult life in which I felt better, no doubt."

According to a survey, the perfect time for a look is 5.30 p.m. on Saturday
The summer heat wave has driven profits in British pubs struggling to survive, but concentrated all the pressure on the restaurant chains.
Pub and bar groups saw sales increase by 2.7% in July, while restaurant profits dropped by 4.8%, according to figures.
Peter Martin, of the CGA company consultancy, who was responsible for collecting the figures, commented: "The heat of these days and the fact that England continues in the World have still led to the maintenance of the pattern of the previous month of June, in which pubs increased by 2.8% their profits, although restaurants have dropped even more.
The fall of 1.8% in the commercial activity of restaurants in June was even worse in July.
Pubs and bars serving mainly drinks had their strongest month, in front of most restaurants, where they reduced profits.
Pubs serving mainly food also suffered with heat, although not in such a drastic way as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just want to go out for a drink.
In the bars and pubs managed, the sales of drinks rose to 6,6 % during the month, while the meals dropped by 3 %.
Paul Newman, from the RSM hostel and leisure analysts, said: "These results follow the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The time and impact of very important social or sporting events remain the most relevant factors in terms of sales on the market of out-of-home activities.
It is not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to fight, although the fall of 4.8% in sales compared to last year is going to be particularly painful in view of the continuing pressures on costs.
The long and warm summer could not have come at a worse time for gastronomic operators and time will tell if the most moderate temperatures we have had in August will provide the relief you need.
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new ones that have opened, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slow decline in brand deployments.
Coffer Peach Tracker, which oversees sales in the UK restaurants, bars and pubs sector, collects and analyzes the performance data of 47 operating groups, with a combined billing of over £9 billion and is the market reference value.
One out of five children have secret accounts on social networks behind their parents
One in five children (some even 11 years old) have secret social media accounts behind their parents and teachers, according to a survey
The survey, conducted to 20,000 high school students, revealed growth on the fake Instagram pages
News has exacerbated fears of sexual content
20% of students claimed to have a "principal" account showing their parents
One in five children (some even 11 years old) create accounts on social networks that hide adults.
A survey conducted to 20,000 high school students revealed the rapid growth that has been experienced in false Instagram accounts, a reference site to share photos.
The news has exacerbated fears that sexual content will be published.
About 20% of students said they had a healthy "principal" account that showed their parents, while they had other privates.
A mother who happened to be found by chance with her 13-year-old daughter's secret website saw how a teenager encouraged others to "violate me".
The research, conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40% of children between 11 and 18 years old had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, said: "It's alarming that so many teenagers feel tempted to create spaces on the Internet where their parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in the directive of the Scottish athletics federation
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to be part of the directive of the Scottish athletics federation as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most award-winning track and field athlete in Scotland and its president, Ian Beattie, described change as a great opportunity for those who claim that sport benefits from its great international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh is recognized and respected throughout the athletic community of Scotland, the United Kingdom and the whole world, and we are confident that athleticism in Scotland will benefit greatly by relying on it in its directive," said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I like being the spokesperson for athletes and I hope to be able to contribute things and help develop sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200 meters and the 400 meters at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta among the four gold he won and now is a regular BBC expert, suffered a transient ischemic attack that left him without being able to walk.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
According to doctors, only time would determine whether I would recover or how much I would do it.
It was exhausting, but I managed to recover completely, I had to learn to walk again and I am currently doing agility exercises.
Thank you for the messages and words of encouragement!"
The announcement of the sacaleches where compared to mothers with cows divides to opinion on the Internet
A sales company has divided public opinion on the Internet with an announcement comparing mothers who breastfeed cows they order.
To mark the launch of what in theory is the "first silent cockroaches of the world", the consumer technology company Elvie published an announcement inspired by a video with music something ironic where it shows mothers who count the freedom that gives them the new milk extractor.
Four real women dance in a barn full of hay as a dance floor, along with some cows, with letters like, "Yes, I order myself, but I don't have tail" and "In case you haven't noticed, they're not drunk, they're my breasts."
The choir goes on to say, "Order them, order them, I'm feeding their babies, order them, order them, I'm ordering my women."
However, the announcement, which was published on the company's Facebook page, has created a great controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received reactions from all kinds of people who have seen it, where many say it can focus on the "horrors" of the dairy sector.
"A very unfortunate decision to put cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant before giving birth in order to produce milk, except for them to take their babies away days after they are born," wrote one person.
The Elvie milk extractor is discreetly adapted into a sucker (Elvie/Mother).
Another person commented: "Trumatic for the mother and the baby.
But, yes, why not use them to advertise a milk extractor for mothers who do stay with their babies?"
Another comment was: "Look at a more reckless ad."
However, other people defended the announcement, like a woman who admitted that the song was "distinguishing".
"I think it's a great idea.
If I still breastfeed, I'm sure I'd have one.
By using the bomb, I felt totally like a cow.
The ad is a little crowded, but I don't turn it around anymore.
It's a product genius," a woman told us.
Another person told us: "It's a funny announcement to mothers who use a breastfeeding bomb (sometimes in the workplace or in public toilets), which makes them feel like cows.
The announcement does not commend or judge the dairy sector."
At the end of the video, the group of women show that they have been dancing with the discreet bombs placed inside the bras.
The campaign concept is based on the perception that many women who take milk out of the pump say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is totally silent, has no cables or tubes, and is coupled discreetly within the sucker, making its users able to move, hold their babies and even get out on the street with the pump running.
Ana Balarin, wife and mother's ECD, tells us: "Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By showing parallelism between expressive women and dairy cows, we intended to draw attention to the use of breastfeeding bombs and their challenges, while demonstrating in an entertaining and nearby way the incredible feeling of freedom offered by the new bomb.
This is not the first time that the Elvie bomb appears on the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children paraded through the gateway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant minors displaced discreetly at a camp on the Texas border
The number of detained minors has increased considerably, despite the fact that the monthly flow on the border has virtually remained at the usual levels, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration are making it difficult to support these children.
Traditionally, most of the parents, who were also undocumented immigrants at the time, feared that proposing to host a child would endanger their own stay in the country.
This risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that the potential fathers and other adult members of their families should present their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with government immigration entities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Office, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who requested to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested had no criminal record.
"About 80 per cent of sponsors or their families are illegally located in the country, and a large part of them are criminal immigrants.
Therefore, we continue to pursue these people," said Albence.
In their efforts to prosecute the fastest juveniles, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear before the court within a maximum of one month of detention, rather than 60 days, which was the previous rule, according to the workers of the reception centres.
Many of them will testify by videoconferencing, instead of in person, to defend their legal status before a judge for immigration matters.
Those who do not consider themselves fit for protection shall be deported as soon as possible.
According to the workers of the reception centres and the reports of the system that have emerged in recent months, the longer they remain in custody, the greater the likelihood that they will suffer anxiety or depression, which could lead to violent raptures or attempts to flee.
According to the defenders, these concerns are increasing even further in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where it is more likely that, due to its size, evidence of discomfort in these children will be overlooked.
In addition, the transfer to the camp without having given them enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends could cause a trauma that many are already suffering.
Syria calls on the "occupational forces" of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked Syrian refugees to return to their homes, despite the country's war being in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were illegally on Syrian territory under the pretext of the fight against terrorism and that the topic "will be dealt with accordingly".
"They must retire immediately and unconditionally," he said to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and several million have been rooted in their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight in this sacred battle until we purge all Syrian territories" from both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly providing training and advice to Kurdish and Arab forces in Syria who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 ground soldiers in this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem stated that adequate conditions were provided for them to return and blamed "some Western countries" for "sowing irrational fears" that caused refugees to decide to stay out of the country.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have already warned that they will not help with the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats state that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a containment zone in the last major rebel base in Idlib has created an opportunity to force political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey avoided a large-scale assault on the Syrian and Russian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem has made it clear that the agreement had "clear spots" and has expressed the hope that military action will focus on the jihadists, including the combatants of the Nusra Front (bound to Al-Qaeda), who "will be eradicated".
Staffan de Mistura, a UN special envoy, is looking forward to convening shortly the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem established the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, arguing that the work of the panel should be restricted "to review the articles of the current constitution" and warned against any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Trump would win the re-election by 2020, unless, as many liberal spectators will surely expect, a dismissal or scandal closes his presidency prematurely.
This would undoubtedly be "The most dramatic end of a presidency ever seen!"
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue in the spectators.
Since 2014, the maximum audience time indexes have doubled to 1.05 million for CNN and virtually tripled to 1.6 million for MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in maximum audience time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has exceeded cable channel indexes with 3.5 million viewers for major night news programs.
"It's a strange attraction that we haven't managed to understand yet," says Neal Baer, author-producer of "Designed Survival", a dramatic series of the ABC about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
Remember a taxi trip you made in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The cab driver told him he'd vote for Trump.
She asked him why.
"Because it makes me laugh," was the answer Scovell received.
Chaos is always on the rise in the world of entertainment.
Obviously, and unlike anything else on television, the arguments coming out of Washington could determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, the possibility that immigrant families could meet or the health of the global economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
However, the information exceeds the limits when you realize that you have been seeing a panel of experts discussing the use of the sources of "deep background" that Bob Woodward used for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's 15,000-dollar ostrich hunter ("an unmeasured pride garment", in the words of The Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniels' s s scrutiny descriptions of Trump's anatomy.
As far as I'm concerned, I'll never see Super Mario again in the same way.
"By offering something new every night, it's in part what makes everything look like a reality show," says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", when he tells us about the alternating distribution of Trump's show and its daily spins of the plot (either entering a fight against the NFL or praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss an episode if you don't want to stay behind.
When I went to talk to Mr. Fleiss this week, I had a sunny 27-degree day on the north coast of Kauai, but he was a refugee inside the house watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not take off the TV, not with Brett Kavanaugh ready to face the Senate Judicial Commission and the future of the Supreme Court hanging from a thread.
"I remember when in those days we made all those crazy programs and people told us that that was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," says Fleiss.
"I thought it was all a joke, but in the end it turned out they were right."

Foreign money flows into the most accurate mid-term elections of the House of Representatives
It is no surprise that the influx of money is arriving in the 17 district of Pennsylvania, thanks to the restructuring of a district of Congress with two candidates seeking re-election for the same seat.
This residential district of Pittsburg, whose structure is recently redesigned, has the Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb faces another candidate for reelection, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former district 12 of Pennsylvania, a district that largely overlaps with the new 17.
The maps were redesigned after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old districts had been unconstitutionally manipulated in favour of Republicans.
The race for the new 17 has triggered a funding contest for campaigns between the main financial arms of the parties, the National Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's name became very familiar in Pennsylvania after a close victory in a special election held in March for the Congress District 18 in Pennsylvania.
That seat had been occupied by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States considered penalizing El Salvador for its support to China, even though after it crashed
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with a slight rejection by Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and occupied a hotel in Panama until the partners relocated to the Trump Organization administration team.
State Department officials decided to bring back the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama because of the "recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the department's spokesman, in a communiqué this month.
But it was only decided to sanction El Salvador, which had already received aid of about 140 million US dollars 2017 for, among other things, drug trafficking control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial aid and restrictions on certain visas, would have been very painful for the Central American country and its high rates of unemployment and crime.
As internal meetings progressed, US and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting held last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to avoid emigration to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior management officials made it clear that their intention was to continue the conference, which would put an end to any consideration of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence intends to speak at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October and which, if diplomatic, is seen as a sign of the importance of administration to the meeting.
The three United States envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further threats or punishment from Washington.
A spokesperson for the Bolton White House refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three United States officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal deliberations under anonymity.
His explanations were corroborated by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke under anonymity condition.
Study of history
The next planned step could be the report of special counsel Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of Trump's justice, of which there is already considerable evidence in the public registry.
Mueller is also thought to be leading him to research the possibility that Trump's campaign would work in parallel with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If Congress changes its hands, Trump will see himself accountable to that camera, just when he prepares to present himself again to the voters, and perhaps finally before a jury of his peers.
This is a lot of conditionals, and I do not suggest that Trump's fall is inevitable, nor that of its equivalents in Europe.
We will all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic which will have an effect on the duration of the continent.
In 1938, German officials were ready to give a coup against Hitler. It was only necessary that the West had resisted him and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The course of history revolves around these inflection points, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are now facing several of these inflection points.
What will we do if Trump fire Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been seen in a good one since this newspaper reported that last year it had suggested recording secretly to the president and had speculated about his inability to hold office.
Rosenstein says the explanation of The Times is not accurate.
"How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the F.B.I. on Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if his office in the Supreme Court is confirmed despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
In addition to all this, will we vote in the mid-term elections a Congress that will account for Trump?
If we fail these reviews, we will meet with a long winter for democracy.
But thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague, I think we will not fail.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador's home.
He managed to survive, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles at the same table adorned with a swastika.
With that heritage, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers, optimist at the meeting against the Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will play on Thursday at home against the Rapid Vienna, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, after the impressive draw in Spain against the Villarreal at the beginning of the month, will place them in a strong position to qualify in Group G of the League Europe.
An injury on the knee prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance from the season until the 2 to 2 draw against the Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use that result as a trampoline for bigger things.
"We managed to make a good point, as the Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old player.
"We started the party believing that we could get something and get out with a point.
Maybe we could have won the victory at the end, but in general, the draw was perhaps a fair result.
They were better in the first half, but after the break we went out and we were the best team.
This Thursday we will have another great European night.
I hope we can achieve the three points, but it will be a difficult game because they have already achieved a good result in the previous game. But, with all the public supporting us, I am sure we can move forward and achieve a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough with my injuries and the changes at the club itself, but now there is a general atmosphere that everything will be fine.
The team is fine, the boys are enjoying a lot and we're having a good training.
I hope we can move forward, leave behind last season and achieve success."
Fear of retirement savings is making some women lose sleep
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, few people talk about this with their family members.
About half of the people who participated in the Nationalwide study said they did talk to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they're not taking steps to have this conversation," Holly Snyder, vice president of the nationwide life insurance company, tells us.
This is the way to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: you will not be able to prepare your family to care for you if you do not express your wishes in advance.
Work with your advisor and your family to talk about where and how to get attention, as these options can be a determining factor in the cost.
It incorporates in the conversion to your financial advisor, as it can also help you find a way to pay those expenses.
Your long-term care funding options may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash-value hybrid life insurance policy to help you cover expenses or to secure yourself with your own savings, as long as you have money.
Negotiate your legal documents: advance to legal battles.
Take care to obtain a medical care power to appoint a trusted person to supervise your medical care and to ensure that professionals comply with their own wishes if they are unable to communicate.
You can also prepare a notary power for your finances.
Select a trusted person to make financial decisions on his or her behalf and make sure that your invoices are paid if disabled.
Don't forget the little details: imagine that your old father has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Describe all these details in a written plan so that you are always ready.
"It's not just the finances that are at stake: which doctors should we deal with?" asks Martin.
"What medicines are you taking?
Who will take care of the dog?
We have to have everything planned."
They shoot a man with a carabine several times in Ilfracombe
They shot a man with a carabine several times while he was walking home after leaving at night.
The victim, a 40-year-old man, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe (Devon) when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 (British time), as a "random act".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
Their injuries are not fatal and the police have appealed to potential witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died because of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu last Friday, authorities said, and the number of deaths is expected to increase.
With blocked communications, assistance officials have not been able to obtain any information from the Donggala regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important details about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi Central, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency that extends along more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline on the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The regency, which is an administrative region hierarchically lower than the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 people in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of the Central Sulawesi province, especially in the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but are mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck west of Donggala in 1996, with nine fatal victims.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Fire Belt, an area of great seismic activity, and often suffers from earthquakes.
Below are some of the main earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of Aceh Province of Indonesia, in northern Sumatra, caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries on 26 December and led to the lives of 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast. More than half of the victims occurred in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
There were hundreds of fatalities on the island of Nias, opposite the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake devastated the south of Java, Indonesia's most populated island, and caused a tsunami that affected the south coast, with nearly 700 fatal victims.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai islands near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 metres that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh, causing destruction and panic in recalling the devastation of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
This time it did not cause any tsunami, but the collapse of buildings caused the death of more than 100 people.
2018: The tourist island of Lombok, Indonesia had a series of large earthquakes that caused the death of more than 500 people, most on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake devastated thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily displaced.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaskan governor and candidate for Vice President Sarah Palin, has been arrested for assault charges.
Palin, aged 29 and citizen of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to the report published on Saturday by the State police in Alaska.
According to that police report, when one of his acquaintances tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, he took off his phone.
Palin has been given a pretrial detention in Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is held with an unsecured bond of 500 dollars, KTU reported.
He presented himself to the court on Saturday, where he declared himself "definitely innocent" when asked for his statement, he informed the chain.
Palin faces three minor Class A crimes, which means he could spend up to one year in prison and receive a fine of $250,000.
He has also been charged with a minor crime of Class B, with one day imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges are filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaskan veteran court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic aggression, of interfering in the complaint of a domestic violence crime and of having a weapon in a state of drunkenness, in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend had said she punched him in the face.
Several groups of veterans criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking her son's violent behavior with post-traumatic stress disorder derived from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of fatal victims
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi last Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and communications networks have fallen and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred right next to the center of Sulawesi, located northeastern Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
There are several videos circulating on social networks and showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami arrived on the coast.
Federal prosecutors are exceptionally looking for the death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York are looking for capital punishment for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people, an exceptional punishment that has not been executed in the state for a federal offence since 1953.
Saipov, a 30-year-old, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike track on the West Side Highway of Lower Manhattan last October, bringing down the pedestrians and cyclists he encountered on his way.
In order to justify a death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and caused "intentionally" serious bodily injury, in accordance with the notice of the intention of requesting a death penalty, presented in the Southern District of New York.
Both charges involve a possible death penalty, according to the judicial document.
Several weeks after the attack, a large federal jury presented to Saipov a charge of 22 charges that included eight murder charges with the help of organized crime, usually used by federal prosecutors in these cases, and a charge of violence and destruction of motorized vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and premeditation," according to prosecutors, who described how Saipov carried it out as "atrocious, cruel and depraved."
"Sayfullo Habibullaev Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", specified in the Notice of Intentions.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since New York's Southern District had tried a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug traffickers, but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York went to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg in 1953. This marriage was executed after they were convicted by conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years before.
The two Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan, demonstrated his lack of remorse during the days and months following the attack, according to judicial documents.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the accusation, Saipov told the authorities that for his attack he was inspired by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also requested that the ISIS flag be raised in his hospital room, said the police.
It has been found not guilty of the indictment of 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defense lawyers representing Saipov, said they are "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a conviction with life sentence without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all the people involved," Patton said.
The Saipov defence team had previously requested prosecutors not to apply for the death penalty.
Mr Tory said that NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the popular army" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former UKIP leader said that politicians had to "feel the heat" of Eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May's deputies suggested that he should deal with negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at Birmingham's concentration that the United Kingdom "would have already gone out" if Farage had been Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge faced by Prime Minister May to reconcile his divided ranks has been highlighted even more when a group of Tories in favor of permanence joined an opposing protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to maintain the commitment plan signed in Chequers in the midst of attacks by the Brexit supporters, their opponents and the EU.
The allies insisted that he would continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the violent reaction, and would force Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between their package and the "chaos".
Deputies Bone said at Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to reject the Chequers plan.
He suggested that Farage should have been given a position with responsibility in the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we would have gone out already," he said.
This Member of Parliament for Wellingborough added: "I'm going to defend Brexit, but we have to get rid of Checkers."
In his statement of opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in world wars to serve them.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone rejected the suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their mind and we want to remain in the European Union is completely false".
The Tory pro-Brexit Andrea Jenkyns was also at the concentration, where he told the reporters: "I only say one thing: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The general public does not like the Chequers plan, the opposition is not going to vote in favour and is not popular between our party and our activists, who are actually the ones who go out on the streets and vote first.
Forget about Chequers and start listening."
In a message addressed to May, he added: The prime ministers keep their positions when they fulfill their promises."
Farage told the concentrates that they would have to "feel the heat" on politicians if they saw that they were going to betray the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's a question of trust between us, people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and today we're here to tell them we won't let them get away with it."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.
"We will mobilize the popular army of this country that gave us the victory with Brexit and we will never rest until we have become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the supporters of the permanence crossed the streets of Birmingham before the two-hour rally in the center of the city.
Some activists waved signs from Tories Against Brexit after the group's presentation this weekend.
Labour Lord Adonis mocked the conservatives for the security problems they had with an application of the party during the opening of the conference.
"These are the same people who tell us that they can implement computer systems and all technology for Canada Plus Plus, for harmonious borders, for free trade without frontiers in Ireland," he added.
"It's a total farce.
There is nothing that can be considered a good Brexit," he added.
Warren considers all possibilities for the presidency
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that she will "consider all possibilities of presenting herself for the presidency" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a municipal meeting held on Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a regular criticism of President Donald Trump, will be presented to the re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, the Republican state representative, who was co-chair of Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
There has been considerable speculation about the possibility that Warren will face Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its thirty-sixth meeting with voters using the municipal format since Trump took over.
An assistant asked him if he had planned to present himself for the presidency.
Warren said it's time for "women to go to Washington to fix our irregular government, and that includes there being a woman at the highest level."
One arrested for the gun murder of the player of LSU Sims
Baton Rouge police (Luisiana) announced this Saturday that a suspect was arrested for killing Wayde Sims, the basketball player of the LSU, last Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m.
They had posted a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying a man who is seen in the video.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot near the Southern University campus at the first hour of Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a head gunshot wound that finally caused his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, for 247sports.
Wayde went to defend a friend and got a shot from Simpson.
During the interrogation, Simpson admitted to having been at the crime scene, holding a gun and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and arrested in the East Baton Rouge Parish police department.
Sims, an original player of Baton Rouge of 1.98 meters high, played in 32 matches last season, being headlined in 10 of them, and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after the team's orders gave him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas classified himself in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the orders of the Mercedes team would play an important role in the race.
From the pole, Bottas had a good start and almost threw Hamilton into oblivion by defending his position on the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to enter boxes and let Hamilton run on the group queue, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went hard one round later and stood behind Vettel, but Hamilton stepped forward after an action with the almost stuck wheels that caused Ferrari's pilot to give up reluctantly the free interior at risk of resisting after a double movement to defend himself in the third curve.
Max Verstappen, who was 21 that day, started from the last row of the grill and placed in the seventh square at the end of the first round.
He then led a large part of the race while clinging to his tires to achieve a quick finish and overcome Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth position.
Finally, he went into boxes on round 44, but could not increase his pace in the remaining eight laps by recovering Raikkonen the fourth position.
It's been a hard day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman by letting me through.
The team has done an exceptional job to get a perfect partner," Hamilton said.
That was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday for his insistence that he did not filter Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault, the Supreme Court nominee.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford's testimony to the Senate Judicial Committee, but commented that what happened in the Senate showed that there are people who are "bad, disgusting and false".
"The only thing that could happen and the good thing that is happening these last days in the Senate is when you see anger, when you see people who are bad, disgusting and false," he said.
"When you read the publications and the leaks, and then they say "But if I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember his answer... did you filter the document?
Oh, no.
I didn't filter it."
Well, wait a minute.
No, we didn't filter it," he added while imitating the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh by Ford in July and filtered in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't filter his story," Feinstein told the committee, reports The Hill.
"She asked me to keep him confidential and so I did."
But his refusal did not seem to sit well with the president, who during the Saturday night rally commented: "I will tell you one thing: that was a really bad body language."
Maybe he didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing his defense to the Supreme Court nominee, who had been accused of inappropriate sexual conduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the accusations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power by any means possible.
You see wickedness and repugnance, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run to get power and control," said the president as Mediaite reported.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against the Dundee
The Dundee Stars repaired the defeat on Friday at the Elite League in front of the Belfast Giants by winning the game back on Saturday for 5-3 in Dundee.
The Giants achieved an initial advantage of two goals thanks to the attacks by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie got the local draw before Dwyer restored Giant leadership.
Francois Bouchard equated for the Dundee before the two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen ensured their victory.
This was the third defeat of the season at the Elite League for Adam Keefe's men, who had just defeated the Dundee for 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth season meeting between the two teams, of which the Giants won the three previous matches.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute (3:35) thanks to Kendall McFaull's assistance, while David Rutherford provided assistance for Beauvillier to double the advantage four minutes later.
In what can be considered a very lively initial period, Sullivan again put the local team in a desire to play in the minute 13:10 before Matt Marquardt attended Cownie to match the match in the minute 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that the Giants took advantage before the first break when he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first part.
The local team regrouped and Bouchard once again matched the match with a gorge in the minute 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the game upon reaching the end of the second part and secured the victory with the fifth goal of his team as the end approached.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five matches, play at home in front of Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller dies so hundreds of people can escape on the earthquake plane
An Indonesian air traffic controller is being hailed as a hero after dying after ensuring that a plane that transported hundreds of people would safely be able to take off.
More than 800 people died and many disappeared after a large-scale earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong replicas continue to hit the area and many are trapped in the rubble in the city of Palu.
Although his companions fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan grande refused to leave his post at the airport control tower Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu. That tower was being affected by a strong balance.
He remained firm to ensure that Batik Air flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could safely take off.
Then he jumped out of the traffic control tower when he thought he was crashing.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesian spokesman Yohannes Siriat said that the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reported the Australian ABC News channel.
We had prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
"Our hearts are broken when we hear this," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the number of deaths can reach several thousand people. The National Disaster Mitigation Agency states that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that the number of victims will continue to increase, as there were still many corpses under the rubble and no contact has been made with many people," says Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency's spokesman.
Some waves that reached up to six meters have devastated Palu, who will celebrate a massive burial on Sunday.
Aid and supplies are being brought on military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance arrives with more bodies.
The clean water is scarce.
The mini-markets are being looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Cross of Indonesia is trying to help survivors as much as possible, but we don't know what they'll find there
This is already a tragedy in itself, but it could have been much worse."
Indonesia's president, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's army: "I ask everyone to work day and night to complete all the evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready?" said the CNN.
Indonesia had already been hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok where more than 550 people died..
Air Accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says a man has disappeared after the air accident in a lagoon
The airline, which operates a flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now says that a man has disappeared, after saying that the 47 passengers and the crew had evacuated safely and saved the plane that was sinking.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon a male passenger could not be reported.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details on the passenger, such as his or her age or nationality.
Local boats were used to help rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed against the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
The authorities said on Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers followed Saturday in the hospital and that everyone was in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events are still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon before the runway.
Some witnesses thought that the plane had crossed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane came too low.
"That's something extremely good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes comments that he and other travelers managed to advance through a water that reached their waists to the emergency exits of the plane that began to sink.
He said the flight attendants panicked and shouted, and he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors who carried out near a dock improvement also helped in the rescue using an inflatable boat to transport people to the ground before the plane sank about 30 meters (100 feet) under the water.
Aviation safety net data indicate that 111 people have died in accidents of air carriers registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but none with Air Niugini.
An analyst presents the chronology of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecution ended the presentation of its arguments on Saturday in the new trial of a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He presented to the jury the way he used mobile phone records to chain the movements of the 29-year-old Quinton Tellis, and Jessica Chambers, the 19-year-old victim, the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night of his death, thus contradicting his earlier statements, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone had been with Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went up to the stage on Saturday and testified that he had not been in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in the Sanford van that night, Sanford said he was "misleading, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistencies were that Tellis said he had met Chambers about two weeks before his death.
Mobile records indicated that they had only met a week earlier.
Rowlett said that sometime after the death of Chambers, Tellis deleted the messages, calls and contact information of Chambers from his phone.
"He erased it from his life," Hale said.
The defence has scheduled to begin its final allegations on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be in the hands of the jury on the same day.
The High Breed: What is the conscious hip hop?
A three-hop hip hop wants to fill your music with positive messages to challenge the negative image of the genre.
The High Breed, from Bristol, states that hip hop turned away from its origins from political messages and from addressing social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make the hip hop conscious popular again.
Interpreters such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the United Kingdom thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
New York's nanny demands a couple to fire her after a "racist" text
A New York girl is going to sue a couple for discriminatory dismissal after they get a text message from the mother wrongly complaining that she was "another black person".
The couple denies that she is racist and compares the demand with a case of "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed her dismay when she discovered that the new babysitter Giselle Maurice was black on her first day of work in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOOO OTHER NEGRA PERSON," wrote Ms. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending him to her husband, she sent him to Maurice twice.
After realizing his leg measurement, a "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice saying that his former childhood girl, who was African-American, had done a terrible job and instead waited for a Filipino, as stated in the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for one day's work and sent home to Uber.
Maurice is now claiming the couple for compensation for the dismissal with the intention of receiving compensation of $350 a day for the position of six months of internal work for which he had been hired, although without a contract.
"I want to show you that things don't do that," he told The Post on Friday and added that "I know it's a case of discrimination."
The couple responded to the claims that they were racist by saying that the completion of Maurice's employment was most reasonable, as they feared they could not trust her after they offended her.
"My wife had sent him something I didn't mean.
She's not racist.
We are not racist," husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you've been rude to, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn?
Come on!"
Comparing the demand as a "extortion," Plasco said his wife had given birth to the baby two months earlier and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Are you going to go for someone like that?
That is not a very decent thing," the investment banker added.
Although the legal case is still ongoing, the court of public opinion has rushed to denounce the couple on social networks, criticizing them for their behaviour and logic.
Paddington's editors feared readers wouldn't identify with a talking bear, revealed a new letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: "It was difficult to put herself in the place of someone who read it for the first time before his publication.
It's very funny to know now what we know about Paddington's great success."
After saying that his father, who had worked as a BBC camera before being inspired by a toy ossuary to write the children's book, trusted that his work would be rejected, added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was somewhat "grid" after his death last year.
From Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family," she added that her father was very proud of his final success.
"He was a very quiet man and he didn't like to brag," he said.
"But as Paddington had been so real to him, it was almost as if you had a son who achieved something important: you are proud of him, even if it isn't really your merit.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and product of his imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone
When he landed, his daughter was transferred urgently to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors worked in vain to save his life.
"There was no regular call to say that the situation was really bad, that it wasn't expected to succeed," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperuse.
"Then I received Nad's call to tell me she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And so I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be ready with you.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that the doctors had given him to keep the pumping in their heart slowly wore out and left their system.
She had died before time and everything was going out.
I could just sit there and wait, knowing all this was happening.
I could not hear, shout, or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I really had to stand firm."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperuse, now suffering the loss of her daughter, embarked on the plane alongside the other passengers, other than the terrible experience that was going on.
"No one knew," he said.
"I hid my head and tears fell all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was on the flight where I felt this overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
That I needed all my love and understanding.
I knew how much I wanted it."
Women in mourning put cards to avoid suicide is a bridge
Two women who lost loved ones because of suicide are working to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 years old when she began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any father to feel what I feel every day," he said.
Davis, aged 45 and living in Lydney, said his son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
"They all knew him for his smile.
They always said their smile lit up anywhere."
However, he left the job before he died, as he was "in a really dark place".
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, found him after taking his life away.
Ms. Davis said: "I am continually concerned that it may have an impact."
Davis created the cards "so people know that there are people you can go to and who you can talk to, even if he's a friend.
Don't feel silent, you have to talk about it."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner with whom she was 15 years old, shortly after her mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt depressed or anything," he tells us.
"A couple of days before Christmas we noticed your change of attitude.
The Christmas Day came to its lowest point: when the children opened their gifts, he did not even look at them."
He said his death was a great trauma to them, but they have to overcome it: "Leave a void in the whole family.
He's left us devastated.
But we all have to keep fighting."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs from a thread at the time the FBI starts the investigation
"I thought if we could really get something like what I was asking for (a limited investigation of time, of limited scope), maybe we could bring some unity," said Mr.Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee was "getting up" in the midst of a partisan paralyzing.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI investigation carried out?
Their refusal is entirely due to chronology.
Only five weeks are left for mid-term elections on 6 November. If, as expected, Republicans have bad results, their attempts to achieve the choice of the man they want for the country's highest court will be severely weakened.
George W. Bush has been calling the senators, pressuring them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House. Thanks to Bush, Kavanaugh met his wife Ashley, who was the personal secretary of the President.
What happens once the FBI publishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh will be able to obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm it for the Supreme Court.
The numbers of deserters in North Korea "fall" with Kim
The number of deserters from North Korea to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, said a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Southern unification, said that last year there were 1,127 desertions, compared to 2,706 of 2011.
Park said that the strictest border controls between North Korea and China, and the high rates charged by human traffickers have been the key factors.
Pyongyang has not made public comments on this matter.
The vast majority of deserters in the north are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says they have illegally crossed the border over 30,000 North Koreans since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and which is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China believes that deserters are illegal immigrants rather than refugees and are often returnees.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to have talks that focused on the denuclearization negotiations.
This took place after the historic meeting in June between the President of the United States Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, who generally agreed to work on a nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress.
"Without the trust of the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under these circumstances we will in no way be the first to disarm us unilaterally," Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "historical" and says he's not fit to serve in the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the House of Representatives minority, said that the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was a "historical" and was not fit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelossi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Austin Festival (Texas).
"I can't help but think that if a woman had acted this way, they would have said it's hysterical," Pelosi said about his reaction to the testimony that Kavanaugh gave on Thursday to the Senate Judicial Committee.
Kavanaugh used emotion to deny the accusations that she had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, at times almost screaming and attracting himself as he talked about his family and his years of secondary education.
In the committee, he also explicitly condemned the Democrats , grading the charges against them of "grotesque and clearly coordinated defamations" organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelosi said that, in his opinion, Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, because he showed his partiality against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with these statements with and the way in which he has persecuted the Clintons and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi objected when he was asked whether he would challenge Kavanaugh in case he was confirmed in charge and that the Democrats obtained a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll just say one thing: if you're not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, you won't be fit not only to be in the Supreme Court, you won't even be in the court in which you now practice," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Court of Appeals of the Washington D.C. Circuit.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible sentences against the Health Care Act or the Roe case against Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would nullify certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This is not the time for a hysterical and impartial person to go to court and expect us to think that everything is all right," Pelosi said.
And women have to push him.
It's a justified diatribe, it's months and years of rage overflowing, and she can't release him without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Mrs Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's so weird, do I?"
He continued: "I was very helped by a woman who was executive in some company and told me that she was also crying when she got angry, but that she had developed a technique that when she got angry and started crying, she told the person she was talking to: "You may think I'm sad because I'm crying.
No, I'm angry."
And then I was still doing what I was doing.
I thought it was great."
Tears are allowed as a way out for anger in part because they are basically not well understood.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs, in an office dominated by men, was once I found myself crying with an inexpressible anger. An older woman, a serious manager of whom I had always had a slight fear, grabbed me by the elbow and dragged me on a ladder.
"Don't let them ever see you cry," he said.
"They have no idea you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they think you've been cornered."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a democratic congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential careers.
In 1987, when Hart was caught in an extramarital adventure on board a ship called Monkey Business, for which he had to withdraw from the presidential career, Schroeder, deeply frustrated, found that there was no reason not to explore the idea that she herself was presenting herself for the presidency.
"It wasn't a well premeditated decision," he said to me in laughter 30 years later.
"There were already seven candidates in the race and the last one they needed was one more candidate.
Someone referred to us as Snow Whites and the seven dwarfs."
Since the campaign was already very advanced, it remained behind in fundraising, so it was promised that it would not enter the race again unless it had raised two million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men, she only gave $250.
"Do you think I have a discount?" he asked.
When he gave his speech to announce that he would not have a formal campaign, he was so overcome by the emotions (gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration over a system that made it difficult to raise funds and focused on the recruitment of voters rather than delegates, and anger over sexism), which he attracted.
"The logical thing would have been to think that he had had had a nervous crisis," Schroeder said recalling the reaction of the press.
"You might have thought Kleinex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are you gonna put on my tombstone?
Did he cry?
The US-China Trade War could benefit Beijing
The first survivors of the trade war between the United States and China were deafening, and although there is still much to finish the battle, a rupture between the countries could benefit Beijing, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, launched the first warning early in the year by placing tariffs on major Chinese exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new tariffs affecting US$200 billion (£15 billion) in products, which accounts for half of the products entering the United States from China.
On all occasions, Beijing has taken equivalent reprisals, recently applying five to ten percent tariffs on US products worth $60 billion.
China has committed itself to equalizing US attacks, and it is unlikely that the second most powerful economy in the world will soon slow down.
Making Washington back would mean giving in to demands, but publicly submitting to the United States would be too shameful for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Still, experts say that if Beijing plays its letters well, the pressures of the United States trade war could help China in the long term by reducing interdependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can lead to conditions for starting a fall in economics in either country is actually much more dangerous than viewers have recognized so far," said Abigail Grace, associate researcher focused on Asian issues for the strategic cabinet Center for New American Security.
Syria is ready to return refugees, says the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria affirms that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help in rebuilding a war-torn country that has been destroyed for more than seven years.
In a speech earlier by the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the country ' s conditions were improving.
"The situation on the ground is now more stable and secure thanks to the progress achieved in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists in an attempt to restore normality.
All the conditions for voluntary return to the country of refugees who had to abandon it were already given due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that since the war began in 2011, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country.
There are another six million people who still live in the country and need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem acknowledged that the Syrian regime would appreciate the help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he also stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that promoted insurgency.
Europe is done with the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the US team with a final score from 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The United States has now had six consecutive defeats on European soil since the last time it won a Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe recovered the crown when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team achieved the 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had to fight during most of the tournament, launched his point of departure into the water in hole 16 pair 3, thus admitting his defeat before Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari highlighted in all his rounds, becoming one of the four players who have never achieved a 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth fell defeated by 5 and 4 before the player with the lowest ranking of the European team, Danish Thorbjorn Olesen.
Player number one in the world, Dustin Johnson, dropped 2 and 1 in front of English Ian Poulter, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spanish Sergio García, a veteran who already has eight Ryder Cups, became the European with more tournament victories of all times, with 25.5 points in his career.
"I don't often cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
I am totally grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very, very glad I could get the drink back.
It is an achievement of the entire team and I am very glad that I was able to help," said a excited Garcia after the victory of the European team.
Now he passes the torch to his countryman John Rahm, who has already defeated the legend of American golf Tiger Woods on Sunday by 2 and 1 in an individual game.
"I feel an incredible pride in winning Tiger Woods, because I grew up seeing this man," said 23-year-old golfer John Rahm.
Woods lost the four matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 record in his Ryder Cup career.
This is a strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, who has won 14 great titles, just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had to fight all weekend to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a high-level golf game throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's disappointing performance: "I'm very proud of these guys, they've never stopped fighting.
There was a moment this morning when we heated the situation in Europe.
But we threw it away.
I want to congratulate Thomas.
He's a great captain.
His 12 players have played a very good game.
We will regroup, I will meet with the Americas PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we will continue.
I really want these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
Now it's our turn to bow our heads.
They've surpassed us."
