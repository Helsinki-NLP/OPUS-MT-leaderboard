Triumph of the populist right in Austria, together make up 29%
The early elections to the Austrian parliament have brought about, according to the first approximate results, an appreciable weakening of both parties of the present great coalition and an expressive strengthening of the right-wing populist party.
Some strong and special losses have suffered the Austrian People's Party (OVP), where the current president's position, Wilhelm Molterer, is seriously overturned.
On the contrary, the leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZO), the head of the government of Carintia State, Jörg Haider, prepares his triumphal return to national politics.
According to the approximate results, social democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest party in the country with 29.8 percent votes, thus losing 5.5 percent of the vote compared to the last elections in 2006.
Worse still has ended the OVP that loses 25.6 percent, almost nine percent of votes.
They are the worst results, literally catastrophic, in the history of these two great Austrian parties since the post-war period and especially for the people who called these early elections.
As early as July, when the OVP left the coalition, the people had a considerable advantage in terms of preference to the SPO.
It is clear, however, that voters punished them for letting the government wreck.
In the first reactions to the results, speculations were heard about the resignation of the party president and, to date, Vice Chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this Monday could be achieved at the exceptional meeting of the party's presidency.
This evolution would obviously facilitate the path of the constant and closer starting point of the electoral results, i.e. the renewal of the great coalition between SPO and OVP.
In view of the fact that the reinforcement of both sides of the populist right - the Liberals (FPO) have won about 18 percent and the BZO, eleven percent of the votes - and that the Social Democrats at the same time expressed their fears that the same thing would happen again in 1999 when the populars negotiated with the populists (then the FPO was a unit, but in 2005 it dismembered from BZO) for a coalition government that came to generate a sanction on the part of the European Union.
For this evolution Haider clearly bets who has already announced that he is prepared to collaborate with any party and that he has already taken his return to Vienna, to national policy.
The Green Party has also managed to reach parliament although it has lost slightly and has fallen from third to fifth among Austrian political parties.
No other party clearly exceeded the four percent limit and therefore is not part of parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India Can Cool
If it is not possible to solve the problem of Czech scientists who have been accused in India for illegally collecting beetles, there could be a cooling of Czech-Indian relations, according to Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg.
So said the minister in New York, after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart, Pranaab Mukherjee.
"If this were not to be resolved then yes, then it would certainly come to this cooling," he noted after the meeting that was organized on a Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, after the meeting, that the executive can hardly be involved in legal matters.
However, he stated that in the case of Petr Švácha, which was exempt from prosecution and punished with a fine, the government may negotiate with the local government of Darjiling in whose jurisdiction the matter falls.
"Your problem could be resolved," said the minister.
For Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, it would be best, according to Mukherjee, to appeal to the highest courts.
He can then request the exoneration of the case and wait for the sentence free, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his colleague expressed himself in the same terms during the meeting.
"It advises appeal to the High Court and then the pardon would be possible," said the Czech Head of Diplomacy.
The only way the Czech party can get into the matter is by getting the convicted person a "legal competent support," said the Indian minister.
On the other hand, he said that such support was already obtained by the Indian side.
"We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relations with India, which have a long tradition.
The Indians also recognize it," Schwarzenberg commented.
On the other hand, as ČTK said, his colleague insisted that the Czech Republic considers the problem of Czech entomologists of great importance.
"We really consider it a tremendous mistake to imprison and condemn these Czech scientists," he announced.
The minister eluded the answer to the question of whether he received from the Indian side the promise that he would deal with the matter.
"I have received many promises," he only noted.
A Czech Arbitrator A Fight in the Seabed
I approach an electronic wall map, in which it represents Australia surrounded by sea.
He is not interested, however, in the continent but a small point lost in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and next to it also the seabed surrounding it.
The region is, at the same time, as large as one continent," says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosusso, who belongs to the team of thirty members working in the UN Division for Ocean Law and the Sea.
Its head, Division director, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the exhibition and sometimes completes it.
He governs this taint and work enthusiasm.
The seabed still hides a little known world, rich in natural sources.
Oil and other mineral raw materials can be found, but also unknown organisms to date that themselves carry the key to the development of cancer drugs.
The fund is greater than the firm land
The coastal countries have now begun to argue vehemently with the new territories under the sea.
According to the UN Treaty, they take advantage of the rights they agreed on in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
It is essentially the so-called continental border which sometimes extends to a few hundred kilometres from the coast of the given country.
It has, according to the Treaty, exclusive rights in all the resources of the continental border.
"Simply, the continental border means the part of the seabed and its surface, which is the natural continuation of the continent under the water.
It reaches the edge of the coast of the sea, and often, to the border of the 200 nautical miles, i.e. pure economic area," Mikulka explains.
The request submitted by the country to the Commission for the delimitation of the outer limits of the continent's border must be submitted with scientific technical documentation based on research and measures.
It is the result of a series of years of work preparation.
"One of our tasks is to organize a technical and legal aid commission.
The commission has so far processed five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For now, only those of the last three countries mentioned have gone ahead," Mikulka adds.
Not long ago, Australia’s success had a global impact as it was the first that essentially expanded its marine domain.
However, it was also achieved by New Zealand - the seabed area that gave it the commission last week is 1.6 million square kilometres, that is, almost six times more than the size of the state itself.
Both countries have invested millions of pain for their study.
The gain that will be derived from the use of the seabed will, as they promise, be invaluable.
Other states are also slowly submitting their requests.
They can do it up to ten years from the time they ratified the "Treaty of Montego Bay".
Where the continental border ends begins the region of the oceanbed declared by the Treaty as "common heritage of humanity".
Already here, no nation has an exclusive position.
The right of exploitation in these areas is governed by the Treaties established by international institutions.
"The seabed, however, is no gold mine," says Director Mikulka with emphasis adding "that its separate areas are legally and clearly restricted and its contract-defined regime."
Czechs in the Pacific
And today, part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It is shared with other countries of the then Eastern bloc within the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
This was achieved in 1991 with a Treaty as investors as well as a few other states called "the pioneer investor".
It has the power to exploit in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, between Mexico, the Hawaii Islands and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is something bigger than the old Czechoslovakia.
The bottom there is accidental, it's something like a sea replica of the Tatras.
"A total area of 75,000 square kilometres can be exploited.
The area is rich in polymetallic concrete deposits containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," adds Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A Macedonian employee from the Division, Rober Sandev, gives us a sample of that kind of concretion.
It reminds us of a little potato or a little fantasy, the Shem, which according to the legend revived the Golem.
During the release of the hostages the command of special German forces was in the place of action
To solve the hostage crisis the Egyptian government had asked for Germany's help - experts came.
When the situation became serious, the command of special forces was ready, but the operation was not carried out.
More and more details are being learned about the circumstances of the release of 11 European tourists in Egypt.
According to data from the ministry of defence and the ministry of the interior in the action of salvation, the German special forces also participated indirectly.
Thus, at the place of release were the specialists of the German army as well as GSG 9 officers, the federal police aircraft squad, the Federal Criminal Investigation Office, also experts in the field of logistics of the technical charity.
As spokesmen from the ministries reported on Monday night, German forces were not needed because kidnappers, realizing a violent release, let their prisoners go and escaped.
The Egyptian government accepted aid from Germany to use it as support on the spot.
"Unfortunately this time has not come," said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
On 19 September in southern Egypt, the attackers had kidnapped a group of travelers consisting of 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Romanian woman as well as her 8 Egyptian companions.
After kidnapping in the desert region of southern Egypt, hostages were deported from one side to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers was unknown to the end as well as the details of the release or possible rescue payments.
Meanwhile, the saved and saved people arrived in Cairo.
Steinmeier said that the hostages released were under the protection of the German embassy.
He did not say any words about the details of liberation.
At first in Berlin there was no information about their return to Germany.
According to the "Bild" newspaper, 5 tourists and special forces have to return to Airbus from the German air forces and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
The United States House of Representatives does not approve the rescue package
The first chamber of the United States Congress failed with very little a large bailout package of $700 billion for financial markets.
The Dow Jones fell very drastically.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejected by 227 votes to 206 the government package for saving the financial markets.
Despite all of President George W. Bush's appeals and former politicians from both parties did not reach a majority for the programme with which disorder should be limited in the financial markets.
With dramatic action, desperate defenders had still tried to convince critics to accept the grand package of $700 billion.
Barney Frank, the leader of the democratic negotiations had asked Members to vote even though the plan is not so popular.
"It is difficult to receive political approval to avoid something that has not yet happened," he admitted.
Already during the vote the Dow Jones fell to more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The cause of that was investors' concerns that the state rescue package could fail.
It rested at the end of the vote and after the failure was made public, it fell again.
Experts have other serious turbulences in international financial markets.
To allow the current programme to enter, it is necessary to have the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Organizers record an increase in the number of reservations
It seems to be a good winter for German travel organizers:
According to one study, the sales volume of travel bookings for the next few months increased compared to last year - even the winter season in more than 30 percent.
According to one study, despite the weakened juncture the desire to travel from the Germans remains as before.
As reported on Monday the German Travel Association (DVR) in Berlin, with travel bookings for the winter season travel agencies recorded a volume of sales that is 31 percent more compared to the same period last year.
According to the GfK market research institute, reserves for the fall months had already risen by number.
Thus the sales volume of travel agencies in October was almost eleven percent more compared to 2007, the DVR reported.
The basis of the results are GfK figures that are the information analysed on reservations in 1200 travel agencies and computed approximately for the whole market.
The data collected are travel bookings made until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weakened dollar course above all travel to the United States are of great demand, the DRV reported.
In this case, the number of reservations increased to almost one third.
Germany's favourite destination points are not only Spain, Turkey and Greece but also Germany's regions.
Most of all organized trips are very preferred, explains Klaus Laepple, the president of the DRV.
In view of the fact that energy and food prices increase, in this case travel expenses are "better to calculate for the customer than during an individual trip."
Among other things, consumers can save money with early booking discounts or with All-Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
Also in the summer months the trips were well booked, so that the volume of sales compared to last year again rose - although according to another study the number of Germans who made a trip, comparing last year, went down.
My first Octoberfest
The hits of the parties under the sky open in the endless spa, the beer in jugs of a liter and the famous people dressed in traditional Bavarian costumes of designers.
A debut at a campaign shop.
Susanne Kronzucker and I really don't have much in common.
She is blonde, the moderator on television and wears a traditional tailor suit.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is already worn.
But there is one thing that unites us: we are barely in the tent, the photographers have already rushed to us and filled their memory cards with the photos - it's very flattering above all because I'm first in Octoberfest.
That's how you make friends.
The traditional cheap Bavarian costume seems to be fulfilling its function.
In fact as a tourist in the Octoberfest from northern Germany my feeling of well-being with a traditional Bavarian suit up to this day was still limited.
But after arriving at the Prado de Teresa everything is not for so long.
Almost everyone wears the traditional Bavarian suit or leather pants; none seems to be paying attention or feeling unpleasant - everything is absolutely normal.
Only my apron receives rare looks next to a banana stand in chocolate.
"The left side is single, the half is the virgin, on the right side is engaged, behind is a widow."
Oh, God, now I'm opening my back to the left.
"All right," he says laughing.
The others don't care about many subtle methods to flirt and wear hats where it says "To drink to get dressed!" and show, without asking, their bare ass.
A young boy who behaves exhibitionistly is called Bob, is from England and is also for the first time at Octoberfest.
To him it seems "gorgeous", which utters with a very long "or".
He tells me after he put his glass of a liter of beer he just drank.
He put it directly next to the fire mouth, most think that's a garbage bucket.
So Bob is one of the famous people who can drink a lot.
Others are not very lucky and cannot consume so much alcohol.
About eight o'clock the health groups run around the party and have to worry about poor drunks.
The health clinics appear every time in a group - all of a sudden there are four people who bring the covered floors from one tent to the other.
That works as with most visitors: Get sober, come back drunk.
You don't see who's suffering from the degrees of alcoholemia and it's on the streets.
"They are the ones who "can't anymore," gave me the answer by answering my question and disappeared in tumult.
Accident victim identified by the police
The 63-year-old pedestrian who died in the hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex County has been identified.
Carole Paulson from Chelmsford Road in the city of Brentwood was involved in the accident that took place on Shenfield Road on Friday afternoon.
The woman was taken to the Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later she died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested under suspicion of negligent driving.
Since then he has been released on bail.
Turkey expands its diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey became a member of the European Union, the European powers envied the desire to enter the European Union.
In the eastern part of the Bosphorus, perhaps just 20 steps into Asia, is one of the most interesting relics of the disastrous imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, in neo-renaissance style.
At least, this is what the guides say.
The building is set to clockwise the end of the platforms and leads in front of two towers, one for each corner, all like a typical German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The building in its complex is a little decadent.
But once the vaulted locker has been exceeded, there is no doubt about what was the size of the company that this was the most western door.
The station was inaugurated in August 1908 by the German consortium Anatolia-Bagdad Corporation.
Germany, a "latecomer" in the imperial game, had the ambition to dominate the Middle East through this railway that was cured up to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond what is now Saudi Arabia.
However, the ambitions of this imperial Germany failed during World War I.
His railroads were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
Due to its isolation from the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, it fell below
British rule and when forces advanced in Egypt, they pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
The news was bad for Hyderpasha station as well.
In 1917 a munitions train exploded destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources commented that it was sabotage.
Since then the station has fallen and remained on the edge of history.
But today, this railway, the gateway to Anatolia and all the eastern centres, serves - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey's willingness to expand its diplomatic horizons.
The Justice and Development Party that is in government - the AKP - has planned a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
There is now a new partnership policy.
The Turkish Government has excellent relations with Israel and Syria, with both Palestinian factions in Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
To assess the parameters of this new foreign policy, I got into a letter and went to the Turkish capital Ankara, in order to visit one of the leaders of the AKP, expert in foreign policy, Turkish Prime Minister Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a jolt trip, which produced the cadence of the ancient world in the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital - a new city, designed to rule a new secular state, far from the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, with its clear Islamic roots, represents a paradigmatic change in Turkish consensus
which has raised some suspicions in the West and especially in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the headquarters of the AKP, an ultra-modern structure of stone and steel - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by medium malls built and "power pastries" where middle class managers in business suits - men and women - meet at the first hour of the morning to agree/make business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a centre-right politician of almost any party in Europe.
Dress, tie, I'm sure he still has a Blackberry.
"The aim of the party's foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey in its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly," he tells me.
Turkey has been cut off in relations with its interior.
Today you have to look both east and west at the same time.
It's not a case if it's not one or the other.
You have to do both.
"But surely at some point," I ask him, "Turkey could be forced to choose?"
"Turkey," he replied, "don't want to face that choice."
Then he stresses a point which almost everyone I have spoken to so far had recited to me almost in memory: the relations Turkey has not only with the Middle East, but with the Caucasus region, and with the whole Black Sea, represent a benefit for Europe and the United States States as well as for Turkey itself.
The message seems to be: with Turkey on board, Europe in its complex can metaphorically mount those railway lines that open the world towards East Asia and the Middle East.
Again at Hydarpasha station, after a second night without sleeping, my thought returns to the two German lords, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who had attended the construction of this building 100 years ago.
How much would they have been surprised to know that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East would largely be in the hands of Turkey today?
And waiting at the terminal for the ferry that will take me back through the Bosphorus, I remember that in those days Turkey was considered "the sick man of Europe."
Then there is not much doubt about which continent this fascinating country must be claimed.
Memories: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: which musical director of Guildford since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (the 11th of September) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the Choir.
As part of the music project for the city, the following year he founded his magnificent choir of young people, Proteus.
It is supposed that it was for those under the age of 21, but at the time when Proteus sang his final in 1979, several of us were ending at the age of 20 - we just refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the changing mythological being of the forms) represented the will of the choir and the ability to perform any music presented to it, whether madrial or Messiaen, regardless of whether accompanied or with complete orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by this choir of young people was often surprising, always exciting, and everything was due to the inspiration of that man and the enthusiasm for the music that continued to be absolutely constant throughout the years.
Tod often told us to "let the music speak for itself."
He would say, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all there, in the music.
That's the only way to sing!"
His wand was always absolutely clear and precise, although never imposing, not too flowery.
Whatever the musical stairway was, it always ended at an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any driver should have been a gentleman, this is Vernon Handley.
I knew him very well during the two decades in which he directed the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Especially in the last 40 years, I have reviewed more than 100 of their concerts and I can honestly say that I have never, by no means, been disappointed – otherwise, I have often been inspired by them.
Tod Handley had this rare combination of greatness and extreme personal modesty.
He hated drivers who, in his words, simply "sold one or two well-known warhorses all over the world."
We'll miss you a lot.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
in his sequel to William Woodruff (September 25th) you state that "in 1946 economic history studies were resumed in Oxford and in 1950 he won a research scholarship from Houblon-Norman... at the same time he was studying for a degree, a master's degree and a doctorate."
This is learned in a note by Woodruff's author at Beyond Nab End, but it's not entirely correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor of economic history at Nottingham University, during which he completed a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J.D. Chambers, and later published in 1958 with the title The British Rubber Industry.
He spent the years between 1950 and 51 in the United States, enjoying a scholarship from Houblon-Norman, and the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he definitely left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason Woodruff chose to ignore this part of his career is unknown.
J. Vicente Resino in Faculty of Philology
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino "Flamenco and Life" because his photographs in black and white, documentary style, are fantastic.
They drew my attention to their simplicity and the strength they transmit, always treating the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feeling.
Resin knows how to capture magical moments."
Second assault on Honda's supersede
In November Honda will start marketing the second generation of Jazz.
If its predecessor already had a large habitability, this new monovolume has an even wider interior space.
All of this adds up to refined mechanics, which increase driving comfort and save more fuel.
Evolution in the face of revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Jazz presents a line very similar to the model that happens, the changes introduced in this monovolume are numerous.
Among other things, an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics should be noted.
However, before analyzing the new model, it should be noted that this new Jazz comes six years after the first generation is introduced into the market.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda has renewed this model within a shorter period than the one employed by other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, Jazz is less known, in other markets this model is a sales phenomenon.
This is the case of Japan, the country where Jazz has been the most commercialized car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
Exactly in Japan nearly a million Jazz units have been sold since their launch.
The second market has been that of the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
However, Honda claims that this new Jazz will allow for increased sales within the segment.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese firm marketed a total of 83,000 Jazz units, in 2009 the estimates point to 100,000 cars, which would result in 17% growth in the European market.
With regard to the Spanish market, Honda has marketed a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, accounting for 6.7% of total Honda sales in Spain.
As for the new generation, the Spanish subsidiary expects to sell 2,000 Jazz units in a full year.
Precisely the arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to greatly paliate the decline of sales in Spain.
In fact, brand leaders expect to end the year with a total of 22,000 units marketed, accounting for 4,000 less than in 2007, a drop of 16%.
Despite this increase in Honda sales has increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8 per cent, compared to 1.6 per cent of last year.
In addition, the Japanese signature hopes to reach 2% in 2010.
To achieve this Honda share trusts the arrival of another new model.
This is Insight, a hybrid of five doors and compact size - 4.37 meters long - of which the Japanese company expects to market about 200,000 units per year worldwide.
By markets and according to the Japanese manufacturer's estimates, 50% of Insight's sales will be produced in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be distributed between the Old Continent and Japan.
Insight's commercial launch is scheduled for the first months of the year, once its presentation is made in society in January in Valencia.
As for the first generation, the new Jazz grows in all its quotas.
Its length is up to 3.90 meters (five inches more), the width up to 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the distance between axes up to 2.50 meters, which represents an increase of five centimeters.
The height, however, does not vary and remains at 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in dimensions, interior housing also grows.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the inclusion of a new platform and, on the other, to the introduction of the central fuel tank, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz.
Also, the capacity of the trunk - which has a double bottom system - is up to 399 litres, 19 litres more capacity of the first generation trunk.
It should be noted that these measurements are from the 1.4 engine version, as the capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 trunk is 379 liters.
Other improvements - in addition to exterior elements such as rear leds or the possibility of mounting the panoramic crystal - are an improvement in access to the rear squares.
And it's just that the doors that give access to the second row have an opening angle of 80 degrees, opposite the 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
Also new are the engines in this second generation of Jazz.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model will have two 1,2 and 1,4 litre gasoline propellers.
Both mechanics incorporate i-VTEC technology that achieves less consumption, emits less carbon dioxide, achieves excellent mechanical refinement and at the same time achieves a high pair throughout the engine regime.
The first 1.2 liter mechanics obtains a power of 90 horses to 6,000 revolutions with a maximum pair of 114 Nm. to 4,900 laps.
This propulsor - which previously had reached 78 horses - has an expenditure of 5.3 litres and an emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
With regard to the previous propulsor, which in the previous generation achieved 83 horses, it now has 100.
This Jazz 1.4 of 100 horses achieves a combined consumption of 5.4 liters and 128 grams of CO2.
Bee Car Preventing Collisions
To advance the development of technologies for the prevention of Nissan accidents, this time, the nature, in particular, of bees has been inspired.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, based on the flight of bees, prevents accidents.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C that is the first step in collision prevention technologies.
The engineers of the Nissan Motor Co. Advanced Technical Center have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Advanced Science and Technology Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Research and Development of Brand Management, BR23C is presented as an expansion of the Security Shield from four areas in Nissan.
This robot intends to strengthen the ability to prevent collisions of brand vehicles.
During their flight, each bee creates its own personal space with an oval shape that looks very much like the Nissan Security Shield.
But the most important thing is the compound eyes of the bee, able to see with an angle of more than 300 degrees in all directions, which allows you to fly without interruption within your own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, the engineers designed what they called a laser tracker (Laser Range Finder).
It detects the obstacles within a radius of 180 degrees in front of the BR23C, calculates the distance to that object and sends a signal to a microboard processor that immediately translates into collision prevention.
"When you detect an obstacle, the little robot will imitate the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by turning its wheels in straight or larger angle to avoid collision.
The biggest difference with any existing system is that the escape maneuver is totally instinctive.
Otherwise, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and main engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot deviate upwards or downwards, or diagonally; it can only be moved in two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to rotate its wheels and not in infinite directions and ways like bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, so that the little robot avoids collisions.
"This device only needs to process information every few seconds, and act according to that data.
It does not require saving information or intuitive logic from previous maneuvers, so it can operate continuously with only a few dozen KB of memory.
This may surprise us, but we're not talking about gigas of memory, not even megas."
This is the first step to develop new technologies for instant collision prevention, a technology that Nissan vaticin will introduce into serial cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than the variety of lithium ions.
Another possible future application of this technology could be the integration of the unit with a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to his destination avoiding roadblocks.
Timble before mortgage
It must be recognized that the US Treasury Department, in addition to having a lot of liquid to inject, is not ingenious.
In the face of the crisis, and to prevent Americans from embarking on dirty mortgages in questionable solvency banks, they have created a friendly and informative game for the browser: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
I mean, the 'Hotel of Bad Credits'... or the mess.
The tetric aspect of this accommodation and especially of its receptionist is to think one, two and up to three times if it is time to request a credit.
And, above all, where to do it, what is probably your goal.
True, you have useful, but little detailed information.
It is more a page for teenagers than a site for all audiences.
What if the game is complete?
Well, there's a dream room in the hotel.
Something is something, because of buying a better house or talking...
Morgan Stanley sells participation to Japanese MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry into his capital of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first Japanese bank, which will disburse nine billion dollars to acquire 21% of its capital, a news that has been accepted with a strong drop in its stock exchange.
One week after finding an interim agreement, both banks explained that MUFG was going to buy 9.9 per cent of ordinary shares Morgan Stanley at a unit price of $25.25, i.e. an amount of $3 billion.
The agreed price is less than 19 % of the accounting value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG will invest six billion additional dollars with the purchase of convertible securities which will guarantee you a 10% return and a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley specified that the overall transaction would be carried out on the basis of a unit-of-measure price of $29, which is 28 per cent above its current change.
Morgan Stanley's action lost no less than 6.79 % to 23.07 dollars each at 17:00 GMT.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to bank holding status," explained Juan Mack, the director-general of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which would allow him to diversify his activities but he passes under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
Its partnership with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street's biggest names to adopt a much more prudent behaviour than before.
The modalities presented last Monday also show that the agreement has been modified over the last few days: last Monday, Morgan had announced that he would sell up to 20% of his shares to Japanese for almost $8.5 billion.
" A week ago, he explained in Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, MUFG's executive director, " we thought the participation would have been composed only of ordinary actions.
But in view of the current situation of the economy and the market, we have wished to minimize the risks and cover ourselves. "
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley titles 7% below its accounting value.
And the operation will translate into a dilution of about 20% of the benefit per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG may convert within one year half of its preferred shares into ordinary shares if they are sold more than 50 % above the conversion price, i.e. to 47 dollars more or less, for a given period.
Morgan Stanley ensures that the capital provided by MUFG will allow you to take investment opportunities, strengthen your balance sheet and increase your liquidity.
One group spokesperson refused to give details on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After MUFG investment, Morgan Stanley should show a Tier One solvency ratio of about 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan needed to have greatly relieved his balance since the end of August.
The last few weeks were exhausting for the group, who saw their stock exchange contribution drop to half while the cost of security against a risk of debt defects took off.
This cost was lowered last Monday but remained at a high level, about 12 %.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only "survivor" of the major Wall Street investment banks after Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers broke and Merrill Lynch's purchase, announced that he had raised $15 billion, in part for Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa in Quito, this Monday.
Refound the republic around the socialism of the twenty-first century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, like colleagues and friends, was the third one to put a draft for a new Constitution to the vote.
Mission accomplished as 64 per cent of the voters voted "yes" to the referendum, according to the official results referring to 80% of the votes.
According to these results, the "no" obtained 28 %, 7% of the votes were zero and 0,7% were blank.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, it would have to obtain half of the suffrage plus one.
On Sunday, two polls were carried out at the exit of the polling stations and a non-governmental organization account had announced a comprehensive "yes" victory, estimated to be between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had also claimed on Sunday night to Monday the victory of his draft Constitution.
The " Constitution triumphed overwhelmingly " , he had assured, congratulating Ecuadorians leading the government of Guayaquil, 280 kilometres southwest of Quito.
So Rafael Correa has been congratulated by Chavez and Morales but also by his Chilean colleague Micaela Bachelet.
The elections, which will take place in a calm manner, according to the Organization of American States (OAS) observation mission, referred to a text of 444 points that consolidated the " new socialism " defended by the president.
The draft Constitution implies an increase in the power of the State over the economy, reserving it the " development planning " of a country that lives essentially thanks to the extraction of oil by foreign companies and foreign exchange sending its emigrants.
Carryed by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also grants strengthened powers to the Head of State, who may perform up to two consecutive mandates of four years each and may dissolve the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that it would use this power and demand a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution further consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the President began to establish in this country of 13.9 million people, in which 50 per cent of the population live below the poverty line.
It finally provided for the prohibition of the presence of foreign troops, which would put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as the starting point for American drug operations.
The 19 abducted persons have been released in Chad
An Egyptian command launched the assault on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts kidnapped ten days ago in the desert arrived unharmed in the Egyptian capital after being released on Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they had been released by Egyptian special forces in Chad.
All of them looked good at their arrival at 15:30 on board a special aircraft at the military base of Al Maza, adjacent to Cairo International Airport.
Some helicopters immediately transported them to the Maadi hospital, a residential suburb of Cairo, to be subjected to medical tests, so they were unable to speak with the press.
"They are well-healthy" and "no ransom was paid" to the kidnappers, Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoeir Garana declared at the airport.
On 19 September these hostages fell into power of 35 unknown kidnappers while enjoying a safari in all-terranes in a desert area at the foot of Mount Ouanat, on the border of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, and since then they have moved from one branch to another.
The group consisted of eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, one border guard and the director of the Aegyptous travel agency, in charge of the Safari organization.
An Egyptian security officer indicated that 30 members of the special forces, transported on board two helicopters, had launched the assault during the night before dawn.
"An exchange of gunshots took place, and they killed half the kidnappers, the others fled," said this manager who kept the anonymous.
According to him, 150 members of the Egyptian special forces from the "lighting" unit were sent to Sudan, where they had the support of German and Italian commands.
The Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini mentioned in Belgrade the role played by secret agents and members of Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and the effectiveness of our men of secret services, of special forces," he said without going into detail.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
On the eve of the Sudanese army, he claimed to have intercepted during a patrol an all-terrain on which the kidnappers were found, of which six were killed, including the Chadian chief and arrested two.
He also stated that they were related to a rebel group in Darfur, the Sudan-Unity Liberation Movement (SLA-U), a statement immediately denied by this group.
Letters - Silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture takes place in the headlines and occupies the current electoral campaign.
Better that way.
But a sector of our cultural life is always forgotten.
Who will rise up to report the wretched amounts that are granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations, or the starving national historical sites?
What politician will dare remind the federal government to neglect its monuments and heritage buildings?
Why do we not have true laws that actually preserve our heritage as in Canada and Quebec?
Did you know that the French government devotes three and a half million euros to restoring it only the castle of Chinon in the Loire Valley?
In the United States, it is written in its Constitution that the protection of the heritage is part of the culture of the Americans and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected and all government departments, and all in concert.
In Quebec, in the Quebec Federation of History Societies, at least 40,000 benevolent people regrouped in 211 societies of history, heritage, archives and genealogy are concerned about searching history, preserving with little money piles of private archives and preserving archaeological remains.
These are often the guardian dogs of our heritage, who protest with energy and despair when promoters and leaders throw their bulldozers against our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
For when is a monument to history and heritage?
The governments of the Netherlands nationalize part of the Fortis Bank.
The Netherlands - being the first in Europe - will help with a nationalisation of the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis that is in trouble due to the effect of the US market mortgage crisis: the three countries will fully support this financial and insurance institution which also has business in Hungary.
This weekend the governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands held consultations at the highest level with the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission's economic competition officer.
The Fortis Bank was the first to face the crisis in the euro area in the context of the international financial crisis that has been taking place in several waves more than a year ago, so decisions taken with respect to the Bank, in some sense can be seen as precedents.
According to the decision taken at the dawn of Sunday, the three States will purchase approximately half (49 per cent) of the property owned by the Bank in their area.
The Bank will certainly sell part of its business, including most of the activities – mainly insurance – purchased last year by the Dutch ABN Amró.
Fortis' actions began a sharp decline last week and for the second half of the week there were already important signs of crisis in the institution.
However, analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees this Bank is too large to allow it to break.
The company's shares only decreased by 12 percent on Friday, this being the lowest point in the last 14 years.
Since January the value of the shares decreased by more than two thirds.
Observing current stock prices, the total value of the group’s capital in the market is around EUR 14 billion, but according to the company’s executives this is not real.
The Bank's management imposed the sudden fall in Fortis' shares to the insecurity of the US market in relation to the approval of the US package plan of $700 billion.
On Monday the shares already showed a slight increase.
On Friday they appointed Filip Dierckx as the new CEO of the bank.
The Bank also looked for private investors, but so far no one has given a specific offer.
The Belgian government had already ensured that investors did not have to worry, they will not lose their money.
Among the Bank's clients so far, there was no panic, they didn't invade the bank offices to withdraw their money.
Fortis has its own branch in Hungary and has also purchased leasing companies.
Fox in the hen
In the United States, life and health insurance companies, when they see the data on the purchase of medicines, often refuse to sign an insurance contract.
Privacy policy experts fear that the personal data market will become uncontrollable.
"There are programmes for the protection of personal data, which are linked to the use of recipe data in all cases to the approval of the given person.
The same must be in independent hands, because if not, "we trust the fox chicken" - quotes the Washington Post to Richard Dick, designer of the medical prescription tracking program.
Insurance companies depend on the price of insurance and the amount of compensation for the customer's health status and if they believe that the risk is excessive, they simply do not make the contract.
Before they sent the customer to medical control and signed with him the contract already knowing the result of the control.
Dick invented a much cheaper procedure ten years ago: with the customer identification number he easily obtains the list of medicines purchased in the last year and half and the program itself draws the conclusion about the client's diseases and health status.
For example, if you systematically take large doses of tablets to reduce cholesterol, it indicates that the blood fat level is nearly incurably high, so it is immediately included in a higher risk category.
There are many versions of the programme, some of them even set a risk number, so the insurance company has only one thing to do in addition to the administration, although there are small difficulties in this regard.
Among the disadvantages of the program are, for example, that some medications are multi-use, for example, certain substances serve both to treat headache and for heat waves and even as antidepressants.
The latter is an important risk increase factor for insurance companies while the former are not.
Special companies were set up to consult and process these data, which before acquiring the necessary information from the pharmacy, require the patient's approval.
The authorities are already forcing them to do this, although they have not been fined for the negligence so far.
Some companies have recently also developed the results of the laboratory exams and combined them with the drug consumption data get more accurate information about the patient's health status.
More and more companies have access to this data and at the same time it is increasingly difficult to control its use.
There is an exclusive law for the protection of personal health data, but it applies only to insurance companies and those providing health services.
The bill that gives the authority to control specialized companies for the provision of personal data is now before Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is insufficient: he has therefore developed his program, which will require the specific approval of the person for the supply of his own personal data.
It is another matter that such a person cannot deny its approval, because otherwise the insurance companies will not sign the contract with him.
So the hens, despite everything, are exposed to the good will of the fox.
Marseille Global Menu
The European Union doubles its trade with India
As the European Union and India are mutually trading partners, this issue in addition to the other problems in most global areas dominated the agenda of the ninth summit.
A Franco-Indian summit will also be held today to focus mainly on cooperation in nuclear energy.
Although the European Union recognizes that India is a great democratic power in development that should have more voice and vote in international affairs, the member countries have not yet been able to reach a common denominator on whether they should support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
This issue has not been dealt with at the ninth summit in Marseille yesterday.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, President of the EU, José Manuel Barroso, President of the Commission and Javier Solana, Chief Representative of Foreign Policy, received Manmohan Singh, India's prime minister, with whom they reached an agreement to double in five years, that is to say increase to more than one hundred billion euros, their trade.
Given that between the years 2000 and 2007, the exchange of goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an overly ambitious objective.
Thus, the twenty-sixth existing bilateral civil aviation conventions were legally harmonized with India and air transport can also fly in the future.
India until the end of 2009 wants to sign the free trade treaty with the Union.
Sarkozy promised to speed up negotiations.
The aim is balance, because while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi is only in the ninth place among the Union's trading partners.
The summit paid attention to global issues.
Both sides condemned the Afghan and Pakistani situation and terrorism - all forms of terrorism - and speeded up the convening of a UN conference.
The conclusion of the Doha round of trade liberalization was also accelerated, although both parties bear great responsibility for their failure.
The EU confirmed that it will cling to its energy and climate programme, that is, until 2020 it wants to reduce polluting emissions by at least 20 percent.
India also agrees with this, as in next year's climate conference, a global agreement should be reached and a 50 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas production should be reached by 2050.
They also wished to impede the increase in food prices and supported the convening of an international conference to review the financial crisis.
Today the head of government of India will travel to the French capital, where - at a bilateral meeting - he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
Paris is confident that the French companies will receive charges worth EUR 20 billion to build nuclear reactors.
According to news agency information, the agreement would be for a period of 15 years.

Found Steve Fossett's plane the missing millionaire a year ago
The remains of Steve Fossett's plane, the missing millionaire on September 3, 2007, were found while flying over the Nevada desert.
The debris has been found on a plateau at 3000 meters above sea level, in the area of Mammoth Lakes Nevada, on the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the plane, there were no human remains.
Commissioner of Madeira County, John Anderson, has dispelled the remaining doubts: "The plane has been located, we have sent a squadron, and now we have the confirmation that it is the very thing that Steve Fossett was flying on the day of his disappearance," he said at a press conference.
The Commissioner has pointed out that no human remains have been found on or around the plane.
The millionaire, 63 years old, has been killed in February.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Office (Ntsb) has reported that a few hours after the sighting of the remains, a team of researchers has been sent to identify the device: it is owned by Bellanca 8kcab, dispersed since 3 September 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, always in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fossett's personal remains have been found by a couple near her Mammoth Lake house.
These are two documents named Fossett, the two issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash money and a sweatshirt.
Fossett's search had been interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The millionaire had won a post in history thanks to a long series of beginnings.
In 2002, at the sixth attempt, he had become the first Man to complete the world's turn into an aerostatic balloon: two lonely weeks of flight.
Three years later he had made the world spin by plane and without scales.
Among his records, also that because he flew 15,445 meters high, over the Andes, but with a copilot.
Glk, the publicity you don't expect
A Suv out of the schemes with an original and well-established design with defined lines and angles.
This is, in summary, Glk the last born among the "compact" all-terrain vans of the star house with which Mercedes-Benz has sought to give a window of novelty in this sector.
Owned by the content outside the traditional, it will be unexpected and unconventional, the communication that accompanied the release of the suv Glk, available in the exhibition rooms Mercedes-Benz since the next 17th of October.
The advertising campaign that accompanied the start of the new car will launch an unprecedented mode of communication through a 3D advertising campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a automotive brand.
A project with maxi-posters, articulated in three different phases, which dominated the central street of shopping Milanese, avenue Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication will start with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic version and thanks to special glasses distributed on the avenue How it will be possible to see the new suv in almost real dimensions and in three dimensional format.
Indeed, looking at the images will have the impression that the car goes out of the poster.
Later, through the use of the innovative Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its details, to be recomposed in a single image.
No doubt Mercedes with this publicity is trying to introduce something new into the stereotype of automotive communication.
Can this formula capture the interest of future buyers? we will see.
is clear who are the Italian hooligans
In the Trivenet, the prohibition of access to sporting events is played.
But who are those 150-200 girls and boys of whom Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the "Ultras Italia" group that has been following the Italian National for years and which so far, to tell the truth, had never created too many problems.
And they had never even met the rival's fans.
The extraction of the group is on the right.
The promoters come from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
These of Sofia have been added a small group (times units, actually) of the Campaign and of Apulia.
They have three-coloured flags where the city of origin of militants appears: Saturday night they have been pulled out so they are not identified.
English fanatics are inspired.
In Bulgaria they have found a group of true Nazi fanatics, those of Levski.
Figc had made 144 tickets to the party available to Italian fans: all already with names, so easily controlable.
And the interior minister had already controlled them all: among those who had gone out for Sofia there was no one with a Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) at that time, none who had forbidden him from attending a stadium.
Four Italian fans, who had a history of crime in stadiums, have rejected the ticket and also the trip.
The Ministry of the Interior now hopes to read the acts coming from the Bulgarian police to take action: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) for at least five years to fanatics who have been arrested or who have been identified in disorder.
An international Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) which prevents not only Italian stadiums but also those of all Europe.
Our hooligans will no longer stand in a stadium.
Lucky for you.
But now is the fear of imitation: let those few fifty add others.
"We need to put this fire out immediately and not legitimize those who behave in this way," they say, "the Ministry of the Interior.
That's why "good-open eyes" especially in view of the National Party of Wednesday in Lecce."
In Apulia there is also a small core of Ultras Italia supporters.
The Observatory meets tomorrow, Tuesday the Cams which can also have an Aise section (an external intelligence and security agency, i.e. the secret service, which handles the problems at the stadiums.
"The choirs of Duke-Duce and the raised arm during Mameli's anthem? Bulgaria is not a crime..."
This is the thought (expressed in an unhappy way) of Domenico Mazzelli, for a few weeks the director of the Observatory of the ministry of the interior (has taken the position that was previously of Francesco Tagliente and after Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzelli had been head of Trieste public security where there is a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzelli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to celebrate the Duke but yes, the behaviour of those 150-200 fanatics who have been shameful.
"I do not make the sociologist – adds the Observatory n.1 – the reactions are attributed in the countries in which the event takes place.
So far this group has behaved well now we will see what has happened and we will take it into account for the future.
But let us also talk about the silbidos at Mameli's anthem: these too are not a crime, but if they do not allow them to be of education...".
