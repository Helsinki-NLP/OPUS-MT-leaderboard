Inflation in Europe has spilled over food
Accelerated inflation, measured in the euro area, is mainly due to the rapid increase in food prices.
In November, the increase in prices in the 13 euro area countries was higher than in the forecasts, after an inflation rate of 2.6 per cent in October, an annual inflation of 3.1 per cent was recorded, indicated the European Community statistics office located in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts indicated only 3 per cent, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the US, British and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered the interest rate by saying that lower interest rates, with the growth of raw materials prices and lower unemployment rates, would lead to the generation of a spiral inflationist.
The ECB would like to maintain the inflation rate below but close to two percent.
According to one analyst, it is Catch 22 for the ECB: "inflation must be deterred" in order not to have to intervene on this subject at a later stage.
In Germany, the inflation rate of 3.3 percent is a record over the past twelve years and in Spain, it has risen from 3.6 to 4.1.
Inflation in the euro area has fallen due to the rapid increase in food and energy prices.
The final market rates for cereals have increased by 88 per cent and the price of soybeans has also reached its highest since 1973.
The price of food oil and dairy products also increased considerably in 2007.
This year, the world oil price increased by 52 percent and last month a barrel of black gold cost almost $100.
According to the ECB, in 2008, the inflation rate will rise from 2.1 this year to 2.5 per cent, but in 2009 it will fall to 1.9.
According to analysts, the inflation rate over 12 months remains around 3 percent, however, the next 3 to 4 months, the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to reduce the governing rate twice in 2008.
Gallup indicates a government crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of supporters of the Fides (Young Democrats Alliance) has increased significantly in early December. So since 2002, it has currently had the largest number of supporters, while Gallup (Study Institute) has never seen such low socialist support, that is, 13 percent.
For faithful voters, the difference would represent, because of the greatest determination of the opposition voters, more than two thirds (71 per cent) support against the support of one fifth (20 per cent) for the MSZP (Hungarian Socialist Party).
According to the survey, the MDF (Forum des démocrats Hungarian) and the SZDSZ (Ally des démocrats libres) are below the threshold of parliamentarians: their support is two percent in the entire population.
The number of supporters of both parties increased by 1 per cent on some of the faithful voters to vote.
The economic climate has continued to deteriorate from the previous point below, the proportion of those who felt that the country's economic situation was particularly serious has never been as high as 41 per cent and according to 46 per cent complementary the situation is rather serious.
After the more optimistic outlook of the spring and the last summer, families are again more pessimistic about their financial situation.
For next year, the majority of the population is expected to increase and only one tenth is expected to improve the situation.
Last December, 71 percent of respondents, a majority never seen in the previous Gallup polls, felt that the Prime Minister was doing rather badly than well.
13 percent of respondents have confidence or confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány while 38 percent support Viktor Orbán.
54 per cent do not fully trust the Prime Minister and 27 per cent do not trust the President of Fides.
One of the indicators of changing the political situation is the proportion of society thinking that discontent with the Prime Minister can be addressed without government change.
While 35 per cent of the pollers wanted the government and the Prime Minister to remain in office after the events of October, this rate currently represents only 20 per cent. The relative majority (33 per cent) felt that the holding of new elections would be the solution to this situation.
On the question of voting intent, 60 per cent of the pollers replied that they would certainly vote and 20 per cent supplementary said they would probably vote.
To make the comparison, for a "legislative election to organize next Sunday", only 55 percent of the pollers would certainly participate and 15 percent would probably participate. Following current intentions, the result of the referendum would be no doubt.
74 per cent of people would say no to enrolment fees in higher education, 79 per cent would say no to consultation fees and 84 per cent would say no to hospital fees.
When we look at only the same proportions among those who expressed their intention to vote in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 per cent of voters would reject the introduction of registration rights, consultation fees and hospital stays.
Auchan is the most expensive, Tesco has increased its prices by almost twenty percent
The hypermarkets in the Budaörs trade triangle maintained the average price increase of 16 per cent last year, unlike this year the VAT rate has not increased.
Napi Gazdasag Article (Daily Economy)
This year, in the commercial triangle of Budaörs, the ordinary daily Christmas basket also increased by 16 percent on average, an increase of significantly more than a thousand forints was displayed in all hypermarkets.
Prices, "which had already flown" in the large food stores last December, have no longer increased sharply compared to the previous high base.
However, consumers are obviously shocked to see that goods purchased well below nine thousand forints last year now cost more than ten thousand forints.
The daily basket in the hypermarkets surveyed exceeded 91 forints, at least, the psychological threshold of ten thousand forints.
And the highest value of the basket was 10,573 forints.
(In 2003 this value was 6,800 forints.)
Prices for Unicum and live fish remained almost at last year's level, however prices for turkey nets, nuts and peacocks increased sharply.
In the stores, the price of flour and bread followed the data of the KSH (Central Institute of Statistics) but, at Auchan, bread was found from one kilo to 139 forints only.
The competition did not lower the price of the product below 200 forints.
It was amazing to see, also in this hypermarket, that the price of the bottle charged with two litres of Coca-Cola was below 200 forints, so it cost only 257 forints the bottle booked included.
It only prevented this year, in terms of daily basket, Auchan was the most expensive and Cora the least expensive.
According to our calculations, Cora increased its daily basket price by 15 percent while Tesco and Auchan increased them by about 18 and 18 percent respectively.
By comparing the most expensive basket last year and the cheapest basket this year, we see a difference of 12 percent while the difference between the least expensive of last year and the cheapest of this year is 21 percent.
Prices increased by 1 480 forints on average.
Last year, prices increased by 1,206 forints on average, while knowing that the impact of the increase in VAT rates had already been noted in last year's Christmas prices.
This process perplexed trade, hypermarkets could not clearly determine what margin to apply on products as long as they were unable to predict the impact of price change on consumption.
(If a trader miscalculates the rotation of a product, it may lose a large profit on the margin adapted to the intensity of the trade.)
Due to the change in VAT rates, the increase in daily basket prices has evolved so much that the most expensive basket was more than 1,720 forints than the 2006 price, while the difference between the least expensive baskets was only 844 forints.
This year, the difference was not so excessive as the value of the most expensive basket was higher than the value of 1,630 furnaces last year and prices at least increased by 1,284 furnaces as well.
By approaching the two Christmas seasons, we found a catastrophic increase in prices, in less than 20 months the prices of daily consumer goods increased by more than 30% in hypermarkets.
(This does not necessarily confirm KSH data: for some basic food requirements, the statistics institute has seen an increase in prices of more than 30 percent in 12 months.
This is the case, for example, with flour and egg.)
According to the daily basket of the latter, this seems almost absurd because the price level of this product, already expensive last year, has increased just over 10 percent compared to the base.
According to the indices, flour suppliers occupy a higher position than egg suppliers because they have successfully accepted the brutal price increase also by multinationals.
In the commercial gold triangle, hypermarkets do not complain, they constantly record good years.
According to our experiences, the majority of customers no longer look at prices in the three visited hypermarkets.
They buy however much, they take long-conservation food by pallets.
On Wednesday morning, large tails formed in the boxes of the three hypermarkets as the number of customers increased sharply.
However, according to our information, turnover is less important in the province, many multinationals complain to survey companies that they do not even reach the expected turnover, not only for food but also for sustainable consumption items.
Many hospitals save on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections, mainly caused by incorrect use of antibiotics, were recorded in hospitals.
The hygienic conditions of hospitals, insufficient beds, overcrowding of medical personnel do not help block infections, says the chief physician of the National Epidemiology Centre.
Many hospitals also make the economy on disinfectants
Not long ago, MRSA was diagnosed with trauma at János Hospital.
Antibiotic-resistant bacteria were detected in a man hospitalized as a result of a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year a similar infection occurred in the same place.
The injured in a serious car accident came out of the hospital but shortly after he returned there due to an MRSA infection and, since then, doctors have not been able to perform an important operation because of the bacteria in his body.
Until December 10, 1,094 hospital infections generated by a multi-resistant pathogen were reported to the National System of Nosocomial Surveillance, Karolina Böröcz, chief physician of the National Epidemiology Centre.
To know that it is the number of infections caused by a multi-resistant pathogen that has actually been recorded in hospitals and for the rest we have no information.
About two thirds of infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSA, i.e. by methicillin-oxacilline-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
One third of the people carry Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their noses without developing a disease.
Infections caused by S.A. (such as angina, amygdalitis, skin infections, traumatic infections) respond well to antibiotics, they are easily recoverable.
However, if antibiotics are used excessively or inappropriately, the bacteria, which react well to antibiotics, will develop a bacteria that is resistant to antibiotics that will quickly proliferate in poor hospital conditions.
In cases of temporary or prolonged malfunction of the immune system, this bacteria may cause serious hospital infections, such as traumatic infection or septicaemia, on the elderly, small weights or with a weakened organism.
According to the head doctor at János Hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infections, these infections are part of the daily hospital.
Above all, we must not confuse the infection with the epidemic, we do not find MRSA only the one or not looking for them, said Tibor Nyulasi.
The S.A. resists antibiotics.
"These patients are isolated, the caregivers wear rubber gloves and protective masks and we have antibiotics suitable for treating them," Tibor Nyulasi said.
A priori, hospitalized patients are examined if they are carriers of MRSA, but infection cannot always be avoided.
Sample sampling is not in fashion
The vast majority of MRSA infections could be prevented, but the current conditions and circumstances are not favourable in Hungarian hospitals to prevent the development and proliferation of multi-resistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and in elderly residences, hospitals should monitor hospitalized patients and immediately isolate patients with MRSA.
However, microbiological sampling is not fashionable in Hungarian hospitals.
It should be noted that the National Social Security Fund does not finance these reviews.
Most cases see only the day if MRSA infection is detectable on the patient, said the chief physician of the epidemiological center.
The European Union has strict recommendations on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also Hungarian guidelines for healing certain infections and syndromes.
Efforts should be made to ensure that antibiotic therapy is targeted, i.e. microbiological tests should be carried out to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always take this into account.
Microbiological sampling is even rarer in outpatient care and basic care, Karolina Böröcz reported.
Many hospitals save on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSAs proliferate from one patient to another most often through medical personnel.
It is therefore essential to wash your hands, wear gloves and protective masks, but significant gaps are also detected in hospitals in this area.
MRSA proliferates by infection transmitted by inhalation of droplets and by contact. However, due to conditions in Hungarian hospitals, the infected patient cannot always be isolated.
In addition, the rooms are often full, the beds are often too close to each other, while in terms of the epidemic, the patients should be removed from each other at least 1.5 metres away.
Unfortunately, we also find that hospitals, in difficult financial situations, save on disinfectants, they lack nurses, the sick are many, so the risk of contamination is even greater, Karolina Böröcz said.
According to Karolina Böröcz, in hospitals or preventive measures are respected, the number of infections is lower in a demonstrable way or the proliferation of the pathogen can be blocked.
Government project against MRSA
Treatment of MRSA infection is exorbitant spending on social security funds, which is why it is being tackled everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has established a program to prevent or reduce the impact of MRSA.
According to published data, this program is effective and MRSA infections show a decreasing trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) identifies among its priorities the prevention of the incidence of multi-resistant pathogens (such as MRSAs) and the prevention of hospital infections caused by these pathogens.
The Commissioner, the author of a fatal accident, was not in a state of drunkenness.
The official finding on the fatal accident caused by the 22nd district commissioner was drawn up.
It may be excluded that the commissioner of the 22nd arrondissement, resigned from his post since, who crushed a pedestrian by causing his death last Tuesday, would have been in a state of drunkenness or dizziness, reported Friday Attila Morvai, spokesperson for the Public Ministry of the Capital after the relative finding was established.
The finding confirmed the first result of the investigation which has already found that the former Commissioner had not consumed alcohol before driving.
Last Tuesday, the former chief of the 22nd arrondissement station crashed a 55-year-old man who found himself in front of him when he turned, with his personal car, on the 22nd arrondissement Kossuth Lajos Street. The man wanted to cross the road not through the pedestrian passage.
(The fact that he crossed the road outside the pedestrian pass does not constitute an attenuating circumstance, according to the Code of the Road a car that starts a turn must let the pedestrians pass.)
The pedestrian died after being transported to the hospital.
As a result of this accident, the Commissioner resigned from his post and applied for retirement because, according to the police's communication, this accident caused him much distress.
The investigation of this case is conducted by the Budapest Investigations Prosecutor's Office.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former Commissioner cooperated initially with the magistrates responsible for conducting the investigation.
EUR 400 million for infrastructure
János Veres, Hungarian Finance Minister, and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed in Budapest on Friday three agreements of a total value of EUR 400 million on a credit line to support education, transport infrastructure and the environment as well as energy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) adopted a budget of EUR 300 million for the Hungarian budget financing of transport and environmental projects to be carried out from the Cohesion Fund, which has already been signed by the parties with a credit agreement of EUR 100 million. This time, the signed contract concerns the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The EUR 150 million credit agreement also covers the budgetary financing of education-related projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for Hungary and the remaining EUR 150 million can be used later as a result of the extension of the credit agreement.
The parties signed a contract of EUR 50 million for innovation, the state budget will use this envelope primarily as part of the research and development project to be carried out at the University of Debrecen.
During the negotiations, the draft line 4 of the metro was also discussed.
The parties agreed that they would reconsider the possible modification of the original contract when Hungary completed the details of the metro financing with the EU.
According to János Veres, this could be done in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has granted a total of EUR 8.4 billion for the financing of 113 projects in Hungary.
The EIB grants its appropriations according to the interest rate linked to EURIBOR, with a grace period of 8 years and without commitment fees.
Bulgaria, paradise of the EU real estate market
The evolution of the Bulgarian real estate market is spectacular, the attention of the whole of Europe is turned to this country of the Balkans which has not been mentioned in the past.
What, or who buys on this EU market that is always the least expensive but will quickly become expensive?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
Today, in real estate, Bulgaria is undoubtedly the largest target in Eastern Europe with its ski apartments and its houses on the edge of the cheap sea.
In the mountains, the most popular regions are Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa and, on the edge of the sea, Albena, the "Gold Sands", the "Côte du sole", the former Sozopol and Nessebar but they are increasingly looking for a building in the area of Kavarna and Balcik too.
According to analysts from Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later, the central region of the country, namely Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, will also raise the interest of investors and are also increasing numbers to buy in the very cheap corner of Russia.
Sofia, the capital, also offers attractive opportunities, the areas of commerce and offices promise the highest depreciation rate.
Bulgaria is on the best route to become one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe and thus be a priority destination, after the summer and winter season, also in the other two seasons of the year.
The most vigilant investors already buy in large numbers, for example in the Bansko area.
According to analysts, people buying a building in Bulgaria are also seeking to change their life, their way of life.
Most buyers are English but others come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present. On the Black Sea and in the most famous ski resorts, we traditionally meet many Russian buyers.
Foreign buyers are divided into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
People who plan to settle buy refurbished buildings, at a price ranging from 50 to 100 thousand euros, or old destructed houses, at a price ranging from 5 to 15 thousand euros, which are then renovated.
The criteria are easy access and communication possibilities, the proximity of a large city, shops and generally that of the local doctor.
The second group includes buyers of secondary residences (since last December Bulgaria is cited among the first 10 holiday destinations in Germany).
The third group is composed of commercial investors who buy in the hope of achieving an average or long-term plus-value.
The price of capital buildings is constantly rising due to an increasing demand.
In the European Union, real estate prices are lowest in Bulgaria, but over the past five years, they have increased by 21% each year.
The increase in real estate prices largely exceeds the increase in wages.
Fodor and the six percent Hungarian
According to the communication by Gábor Fodor, Minister of Environment and Water, the meetings of professionals end Tuesday, but Wednesday, after the official opening, the negotiations of ministers on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world will discuss the Bali Roadmap, which is intended to define the efforts to be made after the emission reduction period defined by the Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
At the moment, serious discussions are being conducted on this issue between developing and developed countries.
The United States also reported that, for the time being, they did not want to discuss accurate figures, although they were ready to sign an agreement on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from 25 to 40 per cent compared to 1990 levels.
Another important topic of the conference is whether developed countries commit themselves, outside emission reduction, to providing financial and technological assistance to countries in need.
An agreement was also signed on aid to developing countries.
The support fund defined by the Kyoto Protocol will be managed by a Board of Directors composed of 16 members probably within the framework of the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF), reported Piac es Profit (Market and Profit).
The six per cent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Gábor Fodor, Minister of Environment and Water, confirms the EU's ambition to maintain its role as an admiral ship in global efforts to protect the climate and to encourage the signing of the new international agreement before 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU was committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent before 2020 compared to the 1990 level, regardless of the success of the signing of the "After-2012 Agreement", and was ready to reduce them to 30 per cent if other major regions of the world and/or developing countries were also prepared to make commitments tailored to their responsibilities and capabilities.
Gábor Fodor recalled that in 1997, the Kyoto Protocol signatory countries had targeted a total reduction of 5.2 per cent and all 15 EU members at that time made the commitment of 8 per cent less.
Hungary has made a commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 per cent compared with the period 1985-87, our country will fulfil its commitment, recalls the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The issue is high in Bali because the long-term international agreement on climate policy should be put in place within two years, otherwise the entry into force of the agreement would certainly be postponed after 2012. In this case, the commitments to reduce below the values provided for in the Kyoto Protocol would not immediately be followed by a new international emission reduction system that was highlighted in the new IPCC report, the international scientific body, which won the Nobel Peace Prize for climate change.
The reduction in emissions would be delayed and the increase in average Earth temperature by more than 2 degrees celcius could no longer be avoided, which according to scientists would have extremely serious and irrevocable consequences.
British Army recruits on YouTube
British Army units communicate on the video-sharing site records made during their operations in Iraq and Afghanistan with a view to becoming popular.
First of all, it was the British Air Force (RAF) who became passionate about YouTube: special units operating in Afghanistan are loading video sequences on Taliban operations since March 2006, the BBC announced.
These recordings, taken using miniature cameras mounted on the helmet, are controlled at the Air Force Operations headquarters in Kandahar and are then transferred to London or are loaded on the Internet by compatriots.
The political message is indispensable
Air force soldiers have already passed 139 sequences on the net by this route and their "chain" has been watched by more than 75 thousand people.
The British Ministry of Defence registered as "defenceheadquarters" in spring 2007 and broadcast videos on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the Commonwealth Office and the international peacekeeping forces in Iraq (MNFI) also have their own channels on YouTube.
Mission in Afghanistan
According to the initial air force objective, the videos were transferred to the net to recruit. According to the Ministry of Defence, they were also used to publicize the real objectives of the army's presence abroad.
The propaganda published in this way costs almost nothing in relation to the usual recruitment advertisements on television, to be communicated to BBC Gordon Mackenzie, a defence consultant, but it also inevitably carries a political message because it warrants in a special form the merits of the military operations decided by the government.
The Americans made a game
The army is outraged because, apart from the carefully composed and censored videos, amateur videos have passed on the sharing site which also present, for example, the death of soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, a bit hypocritical, officers do not avoid talking about losses but never present the bloody side of the fight.
In addition, many videos had already been posted on the net showing the operations areas in Iraq and Afghanistan that were carried out on a real mission, but the British army has only recently packed for the loading of these videos.
The Americans recruit a little differently by using the free downloadable American's Army shooting game. In this game the player can put himself directly into the place of the soldiers in a more or less real simulation.
Christmas Tombola and Beignets in Ministries
Mónika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not seem to be sentimental: instead of celebrating Christmas, she will hold an end-of-year meeting with her collaborators who will be able to say goodbye to 2007 by taking bowls and coffee.
Another department will hold a party with live music, another will enchant public servants with a tombola and offer a drink to create a Christmas atmosphere.
Celebration, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffets, so the power is fun.
Public authorities also prepare Christmas.
This year, the biggest Christmas party will be organized by the Ministry of Defence but it is not the department employees who will be invited to attend.
At Christmas, Orphans, children of fallen soldiers will receive gifts, for missionary Christmas, family members of soldiers currently serving in foreign missions are invited and a press reception will also take place.
The Department provides a budget of 25 million forints to create the end-of-year atmosphere.
In comparison with other departments, the National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economics and Transport (GKM) will celebrate.
The GKM festival will be held in the House of the Future with a total budget of 4,320,000 forints and, out of the six hundred wholesale employees, three hundred and fifty are expected.
During this festival, the Christmas atmosphere will be rigorous, there will be actors and also a tomb.
The NFÜ Christmas cost 4,700,000 forints and was organized on Wednesday in the building of the National Council of Justice (ILO) with concerts and dinner.
The rent of the room cost one million forints, the rest was spent on the more than four hundred guests.
According to our information, a NFÜ service is invited to another Christmas party that is organised with European money by the National Centre for Economic Development, a tendering company.
The building of the Theatre de la Gaîté was rented for these purposes.
This information was not confirmed by MAG Zrt because we failed to reach the person responsible.
The costume is not mandatory
The ILO building not only hosted the NFÜ but also the Ministry of Justice and Police, which, instead of a Christmas party, organized a ball on the occasion of Saint Luca on December 7.
The ILO did not make them pay for the use of its rooms.
This ball had five hundred people.
The party began with the Minister's welcome words and dinner was followed by a live music dance evening.
Answer to the question of [origo]: The evening was not at all mandatory for this ball.
Departments of Health, Labour and Local Authorities are preparing a sober party.
The Ministry of Health will organize a show and a party for its employees in its walls for 400,000 forints.
On the other hand, Mónika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not officially invite his employees to a Christmas party but to a working meeting at the end of the year.
One hundred and eighty people are expected to be invited to have coffee and to eat bowls, the press service provided, the party will not cost as well as 350,000 forints.
Gordon Bajnai, Minister of Local Authorities, will simply invite his collaborators to drink in the local authorities and territorial planning classroom.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will hold a Christmas party in its large hall where 436 employees are expected to attend.
It will spend 2,500 forints per guest including a buffet and a glass.
Since the arrival of János Veres, PM employees celebrate Christmas every year in the same way.
No planned holiday atmosphere, the official character is strengthened not only by the Minister's presentation but also by the time of the feast held in the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture will hold a reception on January 20 to celebrate the New Year, the Christmas Day will not take place.
The reception will be held at the castle of Vajdahunyad, located in the City Forest, and according to the department's communication, 1,000 forints per person are calculated for the 100 guests.
According to the press service, this will be a very simple cocktail to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
These cocktails, organized every year, are started by a few words of welcome from the Minister followed by a modest meal.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not celebrate Christmas at all, have communicated the respective press services to [origo].
The press service of the Ministry of the Environment did not know the price of the official Christmas party.
However, more than four hundred people were invited to the festival organized at the Museum of Decorative Art.
Mega strike forces gather together
The League's trade unions and the National Association of Workers' Councils will constitute their strike commission on Friday, which will be responsible for coordinating the indeterminate strike on Monday.
Saturday, a general protest assembly will be held and Monday, on the day of the final vote on the Health Fund Act, the strike will begin.
This action will certainly cause important traffic stoppages as rail traffic will be stopped almost entirely and employees of BKV (common transport company) will also strike by 1 p.m.
The League's Trade Unions will announce, Friday afternoon, the details of their Monday strike, organized with the National Association of Workers' Councils.
The LIGA strike commission - MOSZ will also be set up and will serve as coordinator of the actions on Monday.
On Saturday, a general protest assembly will be held and, starting on Monday, organizations joining the strike will stop work for an indefinite period if they do not reach agreement with the government.
This means that the date of the end of the strike, from the day of voting in parliament on the Health Fund Act, is not defined.
If the National Assembly does not adopt the Health Fund Act, trade unions will immediately withdraw the call for strike.
On the other hand, if the law is passed, the strike committees will meet and decide on the follow-up.
According to the Monday agenda of the National Assembly, voting on the Health Fund Act is likely to take place only late in the evening or even at night.
As a result of the strike planned for Monday, important stoppages are planned in traffic: railways will stop work for an indefinite period and during the morning part of the public transport to Budapest and more than half of Volán companies will be able to be arrested.
At the same time, at different points in the country, half of the road will also be blocked.
Many trade unions and civil organizations have joined the strike call, the list of which is constantly updated on the League's website.
Some organizations reported having made the strike for an indefinite period, while others reported a temporary cessation of work.
Until Thursday afternoon the MÁV (Hungarian Railways) and the Free Fireplace Union (VDSZSZ) have not been able to find agreement on minimum services, and more and more, as Christmas holidays approach, are taking the train.
According to current communications, public transport in Budapest will strike from the start of service until 1 p.m., Budapest airport between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., the Industrial Unions of Electricity and Thermal Energy of the League will strike four hours, the Teacher Union and the Democratic Union of Teachers called for strike for 2 hours and 2 a.m. to 8 p.m. respectively.
The National Association of Physicians will strike across the country in alternating, the Health and Social Sector Employees Union (EDDSZ) associated with the SZEF will strike a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands made by the League requires the government to withdraw its proposal for health reform and submit a new conception to the social debate.
The second claim requires that the new pension calculation method to be introduced from next year be introduced in several stages.
The third claim seeks a guarantee, in terms of retirement before the legal age, that would allow the functions that deserve it to be carried out in the system before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is the rejection by the Free Railway Union (VDSZSZ), linked to the League's Trade Unions, the Ministry of Economy and Transport's proposal for secondary rail lines and the expectation of another proposal.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard increased country risk
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital (Risk Analysing Division), the activity of the Hungarian Guard, constituted last August, with the support of Jobbik Magyarországért Mozgalom (Movement for a Better Hungary) increases, in several respects, the political risk of Hungary and the region.
In its "risk warning", the company notes that, in connection with the activity of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is already that "in the short term, aggressive ethnic confrontations can occur as a result of the worsening of the existing ethnic tension between the Gypsies and non-Gypsies of Hungary".
The research institute added that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy to probably cause this situation is the main reason.
As they say, this is due to one of the main shortcomings of Hungarian political actors: "public actors have passed the public debate on the Roma case to representatives of radical and extreme political groupings that have based a political strategy on the dispute between the Gypsies and the Hungarians."
The problem is aggravated, normal dialogue becomes impossible, extremists are strengthened and aggressive conflicts are more likely, they say.
However, according to the research institute, with the effect of increased attention from Hungarian and international media, the work of the Hungarian Guard "has significantly deteriorated Hungary's image abroad, in particular with regard to the confidence in the country's stability and democratic maturity".
They recall that, following increased publicity given to the reorganization of Hungarian radical and extreme right groups since the fall of 2006, many associations have been formed in Hungary since the summer of 2007 calling themselves "national self-defense association".
"The common feature of these gatherings is that they define themselves as a civil organization as they publicly declare the preparation of their adherents to defence missions (catastrophes, national defence, defence of the order), armies if necessary, in addition, referring to the inability of the police, the army, or the state," they added.
They reported that everything was done according to the method that, based on the resentment of the political society and parties, seeks to disguise different political ambitions in a civil way.
The focus on civility and association status is therefore only to avoid the legal traps of registration of such associations in court but also constitute a political strategy.
The analysis indicates that the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a factor that also increases the risk of neighbourhood relations.
"Over the past few months, many neighbouring countries have cited the Hungarian Guard as a potential source of risk and the ultranationalist political actors in some neighbouring countries wish to justify their anti-Hungarian policy by referring to the Hungarian Guard constitution.
This influences the political stability of the region," they added.
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not a single phenomenon in Central Eastern Europe, political risks have increased throughout the region.
As they say, the operation of the Hungarian Guard, for example, resembles the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard whose constitution was declared by the Bulgarian National Union (BUN) in August 2007.
The numerous Roma disorders that broke out in a neighborhood of Sofia (Kraszna Poljana) are the origin of the Constitution of the Bulgarian Guard.
In taking advantage of these events, UNB decided to form a guard by saying that the organization's objective is "national self-defence".
According to them, over the past 17 years, the Gypsies have "terrorized" Bulgaria but the state has remained inactive and neutral, recalls the Political Capital.
They added that the initiative had sparked lively debates in Bulgarian public opinion.
As they say, the statement by certain Bulgarian Roma organizations concerning the constitution of their own guard as a resistance indicates an increase in the risk of ethnic confrontations.
The operation of the Hungarian Guard showing similarities with that of the Bulgarian National Guard does not exclude that the Hungarian Roma react to the threat in the same way by organizing their own self-defence, can be read in the risk warning of Political Capital.
At the request of the Telegraphic Agency, Attila Juhász, Research Director of Political Capital, said: Risk Analysis is one of the research institutes' activities.
As he said, their risk analysis is published annually and if events occur that could have an impact on risk change, they inform public opinion, as in the present case, by issuing a risk warning.
The party is not marked in red everywhere
In Hungary, the law defines exactly the holiday days and, around the holidays, it has become common to reorganize working days whose number will decrease next year.
Celebrations are not uniform in the EU and the United States either.
Hungarian legislation distinguishes days of national holiday and state as well as days of rest.
Days of rest are often linked to religious festivals or important historical events.
In Hungary, we are celebrating the new year, the last day of the year that ends and the first day of the new year are also days of rest, especially so that the wake-ups can rest quietly.
In addition, in one year, we have eleven parties marked in red.
March 15 is a national festival, commemorating the 1848 Revolution, as on October 23 which is also the commemoration day of the 1956 Revolution.
On 20 August, we celebrate the constitution of our state, on 1 May is the celebration of work and on 1 and 2 November, we remember our family members and our deceased friends.
In addition, we have two days at Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
The days of our state, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, according to the schedule, it has become common to reorganize working days in cases or there is only one working day before or after the festival marked in red.
It is true that we pay the extended weekend price by working or going to school on Saturday before the extended weekend.
For many years, the Minister of Labour has been in special regulation on days of replacement of days prior to or following the holidays.
The Act extends to all employers and to all employees employed, civil servants and persons working in the public service.
It does not, however, apply to service companies, institutions that run continuously and in service, by their vocation, and also to rest days.
This year, working days will be changed only around the end of the year parties: from December 24, life ends almost all over the country because according to the experiences most people do more overtime or take vacations they have saved for these purposes in order to spend the days between Christmas and New Year's Day at home.
Next year many holidays fall in the middle or end of the week, so there will be fewer changes in working days than this year.
The calendar will be reorganized the first time around the work holiday to allow employees to stay at home four days of aging.
Saturday, April 25 will be a day of work to have a day of rest on Friday, May 2.
Another change is planned for October 23rd: Saturday, October 18, will be a working day replacing Friday 24.
On the other hand, next year, the end of the year is announced under the sign of the holidays because from December 24, everyone will take a non-stop break even if the New Year's Day falls on a Wednesday.
Six useless things that can dreadfully upset colleagues
Emails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive, innocent lies that bother us almost any more: these are things that "beautify" the daily life of a workplace.
The question is whether we are used to these troubles or are responding to the challenge and knowingly avoiding ambiguous situations, causing trouble to others.
Examples.
"Excuse me, I forgot to tell you that you were called marketing service," said a colleague.
That you missed an appointment?
At best he is sorry and tries to arrange things by calling the marketing service to tell them that he has forgotten to pass the message (this is the least common solution).
In most cases, it is arranged with excuses.
Before having painful explanations, it is useful to think about how you can cause unpleasant moments to your colleagues and make efforts to avoid them.
You borrow something that doesn't belong to you?
There's nothing more annoying than wanting to take a file, an office tool or the phone and you can't find them anywhere.
Remember the other day you put the stapler on the desk, but she disappeared the next morning?
You happen to find your pen that you thought was lost in your colleague's office?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without asking them otherwise they're right to be angry at you for pampering their property.
It doesn't bring any envelopes, any postage in your pocket because it may be annoying that there is no more and that you need it right away.
Do you know about the privacy of colleagues?
There is no good way to stop the splinters that spread.
Who did what, with whom?
Or why?
Don’t tell everyone about your privacy information (subjections) about your colleagues!
If a colleague shares his intimate secrets with you, do not abuse his trust!
Bury the shared information in you and do not discuss it with your colleagues in their absence even if your colleagues are also aware of it.
You're sick for no reason?
When you call the office and you declare yourself sick on the pretext of a heartbreaking headache because you feel bad or you think you need rest that day, think about the fact that your work, your urgent business, your future missions must be carried out by someone else in your place.
Don't bother your colleagues!
If you know in advance that the next day you're not going to work or something can happen that would force you to stay at home, don't forget to warn your boss and colleagues to keep them out of your absence the next day.
Coldness, scissors, telephone
You're getting into your work, but you're getting rid of your colleagues' screeching?
Did you, without wanting to, witness a phone conversation that you would have done better not to listen to?
Don't bother your colleagues with colds, cantonations, high-voiced discussions (which you carry over their heads), foot beats, big words or discontent expressed in high-voiced voices.
They may bother even if your colleagues are not immersed in a project (writing, design, organization).
Are you accusing the others of a mistake?
If your work is not done for the time limit, you forget to send a mail or an important message, do not accuse anyone of forgetting it!
Do not put it on the account of any chaos in the office or your noisy colleagues!
Recognize it if you made a mistake and if it presented inconveniences for others, fix the fault!
Ask how you can fix your fault, fix neglect!
Do you feel too at home in the office?
Putting a jogging and shoes is comfortable at home but they don't fit at the office!
Do not wear comfortable jogging even if your function permits it!
Do not be neglected, respect your colleagues and yourself by dressing properly, and if your function demands it by wearing beautiful and elegant clothes, to go to work!
If you want to meet the expectations, you're no longer interesting
Slowly advance in the usual morning cap.
Suddenly, a particular melody is heard on the radio: the voice of a violin to which electronic effects are associated.
I'm getting sound.
Music changes pace and bass arrives to accompany the tones of the hour, then a female choir comes to join it like a real jewel.
Mr.2 released the song Wings of Love de Zagar.
Hungarian music has not spoiled us for a long time with a good quality electronic pop.
Now it seems that the cap becomes different if you listen to Zagar's new album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, the few interesting new productions born from the Hungarian digital underground begin gradually to change the overall image and, despite the new fashion of the garage rock tearing the guitar, the Hungarian electropop proves that there is new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer arrived from Pécs and he himself played in the Yonderboi group before he threw himself on his own path, perhaps because "there is no place for two feet in the same shoe".
His project (Zagar) and music, an ally of jazz, electronic dancing and pop music, began to become known when he was entrusted with the composition of the recorded soundtracks (e.g.
Ferenc Török season).
The early training in small clubs began to be known by a larger audience when the magazine won2 quoted their first 2002 album among the fifty most important records in the Hungarian market and proclaimed Zagar, with Yonderboi, almost the only creators of the Hungarian trend that would also be competitive to the west.
Zagar and his ensemble have become unquestionably "tendy" but no one has asked them whether they wanted to wear this label properly.
The group reacted properly, it released a new and better disc.
The recently released Cannot Walk Fly Instead album can open new avenues for them, although the title wishes to represent continuity with past years in Pécs.
It was a line from the former Balázs Zságer Pécs group.
We are there well with the reference to the flight but next to the aerial music now appears, according to the spirit and trend of the time, the strongest guitar, impact of rock and roll.
György Ligeti, a singer currently working in England with the The Puzzle group, showed his talent in these songs during the first album in the Millennium Park.
On the album, we found a real tube for the radio, mr2 Petõfi, having recently released popular music from morning to evening, began to introduce the Wings of Love melodies recorded with six Hungarian singers ("Underground Divas").
Everything is all right (?).
hvg.hu asked questions to Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new tube prompts me to ask a question: has your music remained a music for a certain layer?
Zságer Balázs: The term music for a certain layer doesn't tell me much.
For me there are two castes in light music; not mainstream or underground, not alternative or pop but commercial music and sincere music.
Music being saying alternatives, underground can also be mediocre and made only to sell them and thus become commercial.
But a good pop song can be sincere as well.
The attitude of reception also works in this spirit regardless of language or borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference between Hungarian and foreign audiences, is either more open to your music?
Zs.B.: Abroad, especially in the west, light music has older traditions.
The, people go to concerts and not only the youth of about ten or twenty years old but also the older ones.
They follow with much more attention the changes in light music because they think it is also part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the public in your work?
Are you interested in knowing who, or how many people listen to your music?
Zs.B.: I am obviously glad to see people come more and more to our concerts.
However, we never made music for the market.
For us music is not made to achieve a goal but for a specific reason.
The role of the public is more important in concerts or mutual influence already works, but it is perceived only in the unsustainable changes of the moment.
But I noticed that if you wanted to meet the public's expectations, you wouldn't be interesting anymore.
hvg.hu: Do you intend to follow Yonderboi's example?
He's working alone and he's made a career in the West.
Zs.B.: We don't really follow his path even though sometimes some try to find traces in our music.
We are rather team players who have confidence in the musical presence of the other and let us deploy.
At first, it was inevitable that our music would be compared to Yonderboi's because there were many of us leaving his group and taking another path.
hvg.hu: On the palmarès of mr2 Petõfi, Wings of Love takes first place.
Many have heard the name of Zagar for the first time through this song.
With this more popular style have you consciously opened to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We did not plan to make a tube in order to sell the disc.
That song means more.
We wanted it for the end of the album to try to soften the orgy of sounds and the more difficult themes addressed throughout the disc.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why were they - what was the guideline?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a gospel choir.
We had the idea of composing this choir of good soloists from the Hungarian musical scene.
This included the six-member choir, Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodossi [Neo], Juci Nemeth, which was then named Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you want this song like that or did the girls change it a little bit?
Zs.B.: This song was already a long time ago in an instrumental version and then when we composed the album, we thought there was still something missing in this song.
The following agreements attracted the voice of the song.
I even sang the melody the girls learned later that night.
I had it almost right away and everything was awfully spontaneous.
I remember that it galvanized me at the time but sure we needed the Divas.
With my voice she wouldn't have had the same strength.
hvg.hu: On the record and at the concert it also seemed to me that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo (with the exception of a single single of Judy Jay), they don't have a role alone, they all sing together and they don't sing louder than music, so music just keeps them singing.
They were behind the stage as well.
Is that what you want?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were in the background is only due to technical problems.
What was voluntary, however, was that we did not want to distribute solo roles.
The song also says that we must forget our ego a little bit, forget who comes from where, who goes or, just let these wings, the wings of love, take us away.
I wanted the others to feel this euphoric state that we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which song did the most work for you?
Zs.B.: In fact, none of the music creation process, we had more difficult pieces when mixing.
For example, with Dorian Gray's Dilemma, or I play a concert piano, or with Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, or the groove didn't want to work for a long time, and then, little by little, everything got set up as in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite on the new album?
Zs.B.: It changes all the time with the concerts and because I've already released this record.
Right now, these are Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The trader is risking billions because of its inferiority complex
A covert fraud.
Thus the former employee of the French giant is designated the Corporation General, owner of the Czech bank Komerční banka.
The bank lost nearly EUR 5 billion because of it.
But it seems that Kerviel is only a great player who wanted to match his colleagues, and who, in addition, cannot be considered incapable.
Unlike all large bank houses, he in time acknowledged the crisis of the US mortgage market.
"He's fragile," they told his superiors who denounced him to the police.
However, if one considers Kerviel's deposition reported by the French media, including Le Monde, this man's transactions produced a profit of EUR 1.6 billion at the end of last year.
The crisis exceeds the United States
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he said in the statement.
Last summer, he managed to take advantage of the US crisis to earn half a billion euros.
In fact, he felt the opportunity from the beginning of the year.
Information began to emerge in February that the so-called "sub-prime" mortgages granted to low-income clients or to those who had experienced past repayment difficulties would have problems.
But this crisis should not affect the whole economy.
Kerviel didn't believe it and he put it right.
Thus, at the end of the year, its profits amounted to EUR 1.6 billion.
"As soon as I won my first half-billion, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel says, adding that he didn't, of course, keep anything for himself."
Throughout the interrogation, he admits that he has misjudged the reports so as not to be detected.
He succeeded in duplicating his superiors, although the Eurex scholarship began to take an interest in his transactions.
Who's at risk has nothing
Was he afraid of being discovered?
Not really.
"I thought the mere fact of getting 1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them."
Where did his will come from to risk so much?
He only gradually reached his position.
He had started working at the Société Générale in 2000 just after he finished his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was around $51,000.
Two years later, he was already a trader's assistant, and in 2005, he became an independent trader with an annual salary of $90,000.
Yet he knew he would never win as much as the others did.
"From my first interview in 2005, I knew that I was far less considered than the others.
In view of my university course and my professional and personal career," said researchers Kerviel.
However, shortly after his entry into office, he won his first great success.
Thanks to Allianz's actions, he won half a billion euros by focusing on the decline in this title during the attacks in London.
And the mechanism was triggered - he wanted more.
As long as you win, we leave you alone.
"There was like a snowball effect," he said to the police.
But the superiors were aware of everything, or rather, they doubted it.
"As long as I won, they pretended to close their eyes."
But that's when the start of the year comes.
It loses a billion euros in one day.
In mid-January, after the weekend, he decided to hide the sum.
On Monday, when he gets to work, he's no longer employed by the bank.
A few days later, the bank announced that it lost 5 billion euros because of it.
And how did we find out?
He became a suspect because of his leave.
"Last year, I only took four days off.
A trader who does not take a vacation is a trader who does not want to leave his book to another", concludes Kerviel.
Czech Republic has the opportunity to obtain 365 billion
Yesterday, the Czech government ministers signed in all nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, which could, in the coming years, bring 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion Czech kroner) to the Czech Republic.
This is about half of the total amount that Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Nearly 125 billion crowns from seven operational programmes will be destined for the Czech regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain about 100 billion crowns under the Enterprise and Innovation programme.
The transport sector will benefit mostly, up to 150 billion.
The Transport program is the most important operational program and represents up to 22 per cent of the financial resources that the Czech Republic can obtain from these projects.
This money will lead to an increase in the budget of the National Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will manage an amount of 90.8 billion krona next year.
The Enterprise and Innovation programme, for SMEs and entrepreneurs, must be used to obtain financial resources to encourage innovation within the company.
Businesses should obtain financial resources for the introduction of new technologies, industry research, but also for the introduction of more effective new management methods.
Until now, the Czech Rep. has been among the new members of the least successful beneficiaries of EU funds.
The Tribunal confirmed the 20-year prison sentence for the former President of Nicaragua
The Nicaraguan Court of Appeal confirmed on Thursday the 20-year prison sentence for the former president of Arnold Alemán, to which he was sentenced in 2003 for a 100 million dollar fraud (approx. 1.8 billion crowns).
However, later he was released and lived in residence in his farm near the capital of Nicaragua.
If the former head of this Central American state, depending on 1997-2002, or not again incarcerated, is not clear at the time, according to the AP agency.
According to the President of the Ileana Pérez Court of Appeal, everything will now depend on prison officers, or they will let Germany finish his sentence at his home, or go back to prison again.
Four years ago, the Tribunal proved that German regularly moved the government's money to foreign companies' accounts in Panama.
These were fictitious corporations and the accounts actually belonged to the members of his family and his closest supporters.
Part of this money went to the funds that German had created to fund his election campaign in 2001.
The budget was adopted.
That's right.
The State budget was adopted.
In what is this budget exceptional?
This is the first budget designed by this government and accepted by the government majority without the support of the opposition.
The one for the current year spent a year ago thanks to the support of the Czech Socialist Party - ČSSD, since it was Minister Sobotka who had prepared it and ČSSD could not afford its refusal.
Contrary to the heated debate before the vote on the declaration of defiance to the government, this time nothing dramatic.
The House of Deputies has adopted without any problem this law which, although most influential, is usually neglected.
That's some kind of paradox.
Whether we want it or not, each chapter and each article constitutes the beginning and end of any government.
The budget is a constituent part of the policy, although hidden behind the competition of power opposing government and opposition.
The latter is more media attractive and that's why he's given more attention in the media.
Political disputes are much more of an interest in opinion than in abstract figures.
The national budgets of past socialist governments were suffering from three evils that the current budget is unable to resolve at the same time:
The first being the important share of statutory mandates, consisting not only of pensions, but also of social burdens, adopted last year by the silent "coalition" bringing together the ČSSD and KSČM parties.
The second being a deficit economy, as a result of the first evil.
The third obstacle is the deficit of public finances, i.e. the deficit of cities and municipalities.
However, it is not the state budget deficit that represents the greatest randomness.
This one is public and relatively under control.
The real delay bomb is the deficit of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors often issued duties in such a way as to unduly deduct their municipalities in order to obtain, apart from taxes, tax duties and bank credits, new sources of investment.
In recent years, they were able to repay these debts by the massive sale of the shares of distribution systems, particularly those of energy, obtained from the State in the context of privatizations.
Today, they no longer have this source.
If only the official and verifiable facts are taken into account, it is noted that:
Our economy has been going through for several years, just like the rest of the world, a phase of growth and ČSSD has been selling it.
It was a unique opportunity for the successive governments of this party to regulate public finances.
Instead, however, they were increasingly indebted to the State.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania or Egypt, have managed their affairs in a much more reasonable way than our republic.
It is a monstrous shame that mainly falls back on previous governments.
We are part of the countries that, globally, are least threatened by poverty.
We therefore have no need for massive social programmes which have, just in recent years, been unfortunately unnecessarily inflated.
Although some of the absurd populist spending approved last year prior to the elections has been successfully eliminated, if a break in the retirement age limit, as well as a reform of the pension system will not take place in the near future, then any policy will cease to exist in that country and whoever will be in power, it will only be administered.
By simply exaggerating, it can be said that politicians in power will become bureaucrats mechanically distributing the majority of the money imposed between pensions and social benefits.
That is why the current budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the mechanism that makes ordinary costs are pushed off by mandate costs.
The projected deficit of 70 billion for 2008 would be absolutely useless if the previous governments had not dissipated as much money as they could.
If we do not really want to see policies in power become mere bureaucrats, we need to be patient and give this fragile government coalition, aware that the State can only spend the equivalent of what it is taking in taxes and tax rights, the calm necessary for the preparation of new reform laws.
Only the latter will gradually achieve a balanced state budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The US Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian Central Banks have decided to tackle the financial market crisis together.
More than $100 billion will be placed on the monetary markets through auctions.
It will be for banks to sell, through an auction system, interest rates to which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the U.S. Fed will send $40 billion to auctions and, in addition, will provide $24 billion to the European and Swiss Central Banks.
This is the first time since the attacks of 11 September that the Central Banks of individual States have decided to take action at this concerted point to prevent or even reduce the effects of the financial crisis.
"This approach tends to solve the major problems of the economy, namely the growing lack of free capital banks could lend," writes Bernard Baumohl's report to the customers of the Economic Outlook Group.
"The concerted action of the Central Banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65 percent to about 50 percent," Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion because of unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect further losses in billions.
"If the Central Banks have chosen this approach, they must really understand what can still be followed," said the leading economist of the ABN Amro Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really bad," he adds.
Central banks fear that if banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will lend more money to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the American economy into a recession that could influence the economic growth of the world.
The Central Banks made this choice after they failed to lower London's interbank rate, called LIBOR, used to borrow into the interbank market.
This meant that banks were always afraid of mutual borrowings, although the US, Canadian and English Central Banks had declined their interest rates several times in the fall.
"This will have the same effect as a further decrease in interest rates," Reuters Greg Salvage of Tempus Consulting told the company.
Some analysts do not believe that the central banks' approach will contribute to the crisis as it does not address the main problem of the fall in the real estate market in the USA.
President Klaus: the debates of ecologists are incredible
Global climate change is expected to be detrimental primarily to developing countries.
President Václav Klaus again spoke on the issue of global warming.
The criticism struck this time at the United Nations International Conference on Climate Change ending in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book The blue planet, not green, he stated that the debates of environmentalists were incredible.
According to Klaus, it is not only the structure of the conference, consisting of a curious mix of representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations, which is unacceptable, but also the basic difference between the rhetoric accompanying it and the reality.
"The debate is not structured at all, it's just a rocket of words, putting up solutions to the current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech President stressed, when presenting his book, that his subject is of great importance to him and that is why he is committed to this cause.
He also expressed his satisfaction at what his book also appeared in German translation, since, he said, "I often encounter only the caricature of my opinions".
Right now, interested people can read their positions without being distorted.
Klaus recalled that although he is not a climatologist, he nevertheless believes he has enough provisions to write such a book.
He is indeed an academic able to follow and appreciate scientific treaties, he has the practice of statistics and he is also an economist.
The main conclusions of the book are, according to him, the following thesis: the climate is constantly changing, the changes of the book are normal, there is no shared opinion by all researchers on global warming, the effects of current changes are neither too important nor too serious, they are therefore no danger and, finally, the efforts to influence climate change are useless, ineffective and unacceptablely costly.
Especially since he has experience of a totalitarian regime, he considers it unacceptable to impose unverified opinions on others, which he feels is a dangerous violation of freedom.
In response to the questions of the people present, he repeatedly explained that it was not against "reasonable protection of the environment, but against an inclusive environmentalism that does not take into account the relationship between the costs and the profit they bring."
In Vienna, Klaus had already talked about this two months ago at Hayek Institute.
600 thousand people failed to renew their driver's license in time
Six hundred thousand drivers have allowed the time limit to expire and have failed to renew their former driver's license whose validity expires at the end of the year.
We are the last day when people can still apply for renewal, so that the authorities are able to issue them a new permit before the end of the year.
However, the Department is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers without a valid licence will take the road.
According to the authorities, they did not renew their licence to drive especially those who no longer wish to drive.
While municipalities report a drop in the number of licence renewal applications, the authorities in the capital are overwhelmed with applications and the number of licence renewal applications has increased this week.
The City Hall meets approximately 2000 customers per day.
There's a tail about half an hour.
In Prague, nearly 140 OOO drivers have not yet renewed their driver's licenses.
The issuance of a new licence takes 20 days.
But it is possible to apply for release within a short period of five days.
In this case, the driver pays an additional five hundred crowns.
Vehicle drivers who will not be able to complete the compulsory renewal of the driver's licence by the end of the year and take the road without a valid licence will be liable to a fine as of January.
The culprit will be forced to pay up to two thousand crowns.
However, the police officer may also treat the offence by using a friendly approach.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine shall rise to 2500 crowns.
According to former information, it was liable to a fine even a person who was not going to circulate.
This could be forced to pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry had called on the authorities to moderate and impose fines not exceeding 1000 crowns.
However, according to the spokesman for the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka, no one is at risk of fines in tens of thousands.
The driver's license is, in his view, a document that people can decide whether they want to have it or not.
It is not like with the ID card that must be valid without exception.
People who no longer wish to drive should return their driver's license.
Simply bring it or send it to the appropriate municipality.
Driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid at the end of the year.
However, vehicle drivers are also forced to gradually renew other types of driving licences.
People with documents from 1994 to 2000 still have three years to complete the renewal.
The validity of driving licences issued in the years 2001 to 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million other documents.
The Tribunal reduced the sentences of detectives agreed with Berdych
Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, former police officers accused of conniving with the gang of David Berdych, respectively, will serve 13 and 10 years in prison.
The High Court of Prague condemned them definitively by reducing their sentences by 1 and 2 years respectively.
Originally, the detectives of the Department for Combating Organized Crime were at risk of imprisonment of 14 and 12 years.
It is no longer possible to appeal against today's judgment, but only one appeal to the High Court is possible.
Although Berdych is also accused in this case, he is only waiting for the verdict of first instance.
However, he has already been sentenced to more than 16 years in prison in other trials.
He can't get any more.
In January, the Departmental Court found that 19 people were guilty of participation in hold-ups, and today the High Court dealt with the appeal interviews of 16 of them.
Most of the defendants, from the beginning of the investigation, questioned the charge by claiming that it was a handled case.
According to the Central Bohemian Court of Justice, police members, after an agreement with Berdych, transmitted information from police sources to criminals, covered the various hold-ups and helped gang members avoid criminal responsibility.
The gang was returning 30 percent of the larcin in Opava and Koňařík.
In the prosecution there is a question of gang criminal activity in the years 1999 to 2001.
Essentially armed robbery, most of which victims have suffered a serious health injury, but also abuse of the power of a public official and prohibited armament.
During home searches, the police discovered illegally detained guns, shells with a steel core, a laser direct shooter or a machine gun.
According to the charges, the gang has enriched itself with tens of millions of crowns.
Apart from about twenty men in this trial, the courts have already found themselves guilty of other hand-lifted robberies Berdych and a whole series of other people.
Other men from Berdych's neighborhood are still explaining themselves before the court in another trial, some cases have not yet arrived to the court.
For the time being, the main hearing avoided Tomáš Pňta and Maroš Šulej who are currently in detention in Ireland, where they await the final decision regarding their extradition to the Czech Republic.
The price of child replacement: 12 million
The lawyer for Igor Veleba families wants to get compensation from the Třebíč hospital for 12 million crowns plus the costs.
Three million for each of the mothers, two million for the fathers and one million for each of the children.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
This is why hospital attorney Ondřej Dostál is absolutely not in agreement with Veleba's proposal.
"We refuse such a claim, it is very high," Dostál said at the hearing.
"In order to be able to make an opinion on the counter-proposal, we need the expert report which the opposing party has commissioned the drafting.
We're going to see if this one has any explanatory value.
But we continue to think that the total amount should not exceed hundreds of thousands," Dostál said.
According to him, the amount should be set at between 100,000 and 200,000 Kč for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, Jabloňov's family demanded a million crowns for each month where she could not raise her biological daughter.
Veleba used the expert report, prepared for him by the University Hospital Centre in Prague-Motol, as a document supporting the negotiations for compensation.
According to psychology and psychiatry experts, parents suffered psychological damage and were subjected to stress at different scales and depths.
The stress situation has been better borne by men, although they have been faced with remorse that they have not been able to prevent the replacement of newborns.
Women, they, remain less serene in the face of the current trauma and precisely what is happening at the moment, summarized the content of the Veleba report.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurses at the Třebíč hospital on 9 December.
Last week, children returned to their biological parents - Nikola at Čermák in Přibyslavice and Veronika at Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová in Jabloňov.
The governor of the Vysočina Miloš Vystrčil region gave, at the end of October, each of the families 100,000 crowns for the reimbursement of expenses caused by the error of the Třebíč hospital managed by the region.
All hospitals in Czech Republic are subject to civil liability insurance by law.
In the event of a failure, they must pull into the reserve fund, exceptionally, they may ask for help from the manager.
So far the courts recognized relatively low compensation, the amounts calculated according to the tables were around hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Polivka lost Valašské Království (Kalašsko Kingdom)
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute about the Valašské království brand (Kayaume de Valašsko).
According to the judge of the Ostrava Regional Court, he had actually used the title Valašsko King for the first time, but the project was set up by the team around Tomáš Harabiš, the former collaborator of the actor.
Polivka was not present at today's hearing.
But according to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and his client will appeal.
"The dispute concerns the fact that Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasitizing about Bolek Polívka's popularity," said Polívka's lawyer after the trial.
According to him, the words of the Kingdom of Valašsko evoke to everyone precisely this actor and comic.
Harabiš is of the same opinion.
"There is almost ten years of work behind us.
Looking for money and developing events," he said.
According to him, money is the cause of the dispute.
"After years, they realized that the project was successful and that they could benefit from it.
They're the ones who want to parasite on our work," he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, it was Polívka who used the title valašský král (King of Valašsko) for the first time in his television show.
The actor Radoslav Brzobohatý had crowned him king in 1993.
At the time, however, it was not related to the project of establishing a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came up with the idea of making passports appear from Valašské Království.
From a humorous action originally came a lucrative business and business activity, followed by the creation by Harabiš of the company Valašské království.
In 1997 Polívka agreed that his name and signature should be mentioned in the passport and even offered to the holders the balance on the price of the visit of his farm and theatre shows.
Who's gonna sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabiš only used the naked idea, published by Polívka in the Manež broadcast, for commercial purposes.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polivka certainly helped the Valašské království project," the judge said.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was made up of Harabiš and his team that devoted itself to the project intensely.
The collaboration between today's enemy parties continued until 2000 when Harabiš organized an official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
But from then on, conflicts began to accumulate between Polívka and Harabiš, which culminated in the deposition "of King Boleslav 1 elected forever".
The ruling role in the kingdom was then, under the inspiration of Harabiš, assumed by the singer Jarmila Šulaková as Mother Queen.
Then, in 2002, Polivka filed a complaint against Harabiš and his company, asking that the court today rejected it.
What might make the matter clear is the tournament envisaged for the throne and half of the princess.
He should come out with a new king.
He still didn't want to betray the details and the date.
"We don't want to go fast in need.
It would be something like the King's parade in Slovácko.
The king would be elected for a while.
Even Mr. Polívka can of course register," Harabiš added.
Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi test: disappearance of prejudices
Actually, I've never been a big fan of Peugeot 206.
Its bearing qualities were nothing extraordinary, the quality of speed change, driving and manufacturing could, in many respects, be described as inferior to the average.
However, there is currently its successor in the market the Peugeot 207, which is significantly better.
Even more so as the SW called combi goes one step further, I just have to think about it.
When I was testing the classic Peugeot 207 hatback I complained for example about the space for the head on the seats behind.
As the complaint ends, because the cobbled body means that even the great devils will be comfortable in this respect.
Let's see soon.
I'll talk about the inside very quickly so I won't repeat myself too much.
It's a pretty successful design, my only remark about the central tunnel that seems to me poor.
There, I would have liked a slightly more inventive design, since the car looks so elegant.
Seats are comfortable and the time when you could complain about seats or too short records is up.
Lateral guidance has also improved significantly compared to model 206.
As for space, the increase in body dimensions is also sensitive here.
The combi also sees the lack of place above the head already mentioned.
A safe in the chest
The most important thing about this vehicle is its luggage rack.
I have to evaluate it as very well accessible (also thanks to the back pivoting ice) and a rather easy fixture.
Blind spaces are equipped with stop elastics that constitute an ideal compromise.
It is not bulky and can be extended while being able to hold quite heavy objects.
But let's stop by the volume.
This, according to the tables, makes 428 l in the basic configuration, which is compared to competition a rather average figure.
Apart from Škoda Fabia Combi, the most sold vehicle of this category in Czech Republic.
Comparing the 207 SW with the new generation of Mlada Boleslav product, it is observed that the Peugeot remains very significantly behind, the difference being 52 litres.
When it comes to travelling abroad or loading a stroller, this figure is almost critical.
But if I had to highlight the benefits, I would mention the bottom of the box left after the reverse of the rear seat files perfectly straight, or a very low foot.
120 horses spread over four cylinders
The car we tested was equipped with a four-cylinder Otto engine with a volume of 1.6 l and a power of 88 kW.
And actually, that's what a 1.6 should look like that makes a family hatback walk.
It is silent, consumes little and, above all, grows well.
If I compare it to the equivalent produced by Škoda, which often gives the impression that I have an escape pot stuffed by a napkin, then I can only be enthusiastic.
Browse the rates
The price of the vehicle is not affordable by all.
However, we must be aware that we have tested a car quite well equipped, with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a vehicle with an Otto 1.4 litre engine up to 329 900 Kč is still affordable.
The vehicle we tested costs from 410 900 Kč, which is already enough.
Premium equipment, also tested, increases the price of 80,000 Kč.
However, we have also arranged head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic wipes, automatic rear window control...
In fact, the vehicle costs at the end of the account 531 900 Kč.
It's a lot, but try to add additional equipment to Fabia's price and you'll get a very similar figure.
So it's only left to choose the mark.
The integration of Slovak students into British schools is not easy
The number of children from Eastern European countries in British schools is increasing, causing concern among those who remain concerned about the evolution of local education.
The integration of Eastern Europeans is currently facing a number of obstacles.
British schools even see cases where conflicts between immigrants and descendants of the inhabitants of origin turn into violence.
The case of North Kent, where the ongoing and immigrant conflicts of Slovak origin are beginning to intensify, illustrates the problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe.
The arguments, the chicane and the fights among the students have become part of the relationship between the parents.
The situation went so far that the police arrested a Slovak woman in Chatham who hit a ten-year-old student with an iron bar.
The culprit defends herself by asserting that the boy had insulted him with racist remarks.
The police also had to intervene as a result of the attack on a Slovak immigrant by two adolescents.
The girls had allegedly addressed this man with racist remarks and threw stones at him.
"When we went home, a young man climbed up on the bus stop and began to spit on us.
When I told him to stop, he answered by apples and pears and then discovered his butts," described another unpleasant adventure a mother of Slovak students.
Complaints are made by both parties.
One of the remaining people went to qualify for conflicts with immigrants in the struggle for survival.
The above-mentioned cases show that the atmosphere in British schools between the inhabitants of origin and immigrants is beginning to be tense.
70 thousand Slovaks came to find work are registered in Britain.
And about 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful Caribbean island
For visitors, it's really an island of freedom.
Everything you expect of your holidays can happen if you make a good choice.
Golden and white beaches such as snow, high waves or then a calm sea like a pond.
Palms and all inclusive with servers offering you on the beach a pizza, ice or even a hearty cocktail.
The kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean Sea, you will not find this list only in its entirety, but enriched.
However, there is only one island on which you will find much more and it is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island of the Great Antilles.
In the time of the Spaniards, Cuba had been the bastion of their invasion of America.
Christophe Columbus described it as the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana has become the deposit and place of transhipment of the treasures that the Spaniards had stolen and transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was built at the beginning of the 1920s.
It was Lucky Luciano, one of the leaders of the U.S. mafia, who built it, because everything that was a crime in the USA (especially under the ban) was admitted and supported in Cuba: drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among its customers were, among other things,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-rise buildings grew and cars, belonging to the cult symbols of the 1950s of the last century, circulated on the wide boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojímar he had his yacht.
The stars of the business show and politicians from all over America left their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio.
What about today?
You can leave your autograph on the walls of the Havana Bodeguita.
In the bar of the hotel Nacional, a luxury hotel, you will be mixed the cocktail of your choice.
And these cult cars still circulate in Havana, since the jigoulis and the previously imported fiats have long, in a climate so salty and wet, rotten.
Although Havana, especially the oldest part, is significantly decrepit, nowhere else in the vicinity there are as many splendid colonial monuments as there is precisely there.
Other places become more beautiful, for example Trinidad.
Since tourism brings money if necessary, its development has green fire.
For the past fifteen years, new hotels have moved not only to Havana, but above all to Varader, on the coast of Holguín province, as well as on small islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a fantasy that is unique to the world and will be appreciated especially by small train lovers.
The cane had returned from the plantations extended in the sugars on a narrow track by small steam and motor trains.
Their rolling stock has not been renewed for decades, and this is how small locomotives are being set up where contemporary people are not only in museums.
Where to lead his steps?
The majority of visitors do not miss the most known places.
So there is no need to write long on Varadero or on Havana.
Otherwise remember that in Hemingway's property, already mentioned, there is a museum and that the one who loves this writer should not miss the visit.
The Viňales Valley to the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
An exuberant vegetation grows on a limestone soil.
Mogots, limestone balloons and rocks rise in chandeliers from the bottom of the valley, and, from fertile soil having been caught in their enclosures, even its rotten rocks are covered with a very dense plant carpet.
The valley is the place where Cuban tobacco is likely to be cultivated of the best quality.
You can meet the final form of this product if you visit one of Havana's cigar factories.
Someone may also find it interesting that this is where Major Zeman's Chilean episode was turned.
Trinidad
Old town founded shortly after the Spaniards colonized the island.
It was the trade of slaves and the trade of sugar that brought him glory and wealth.
Wealth has embodied in the beauty and character of this small-sized city.
Koloniální španělská architecture, výrazně ovlivněná poudějšími francuzskými osadníky, if čtyři staletí teměř nezměnila.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the mountain massif Escambray, is a place so far apart that in the 1950s of the last century, there was no road connecting this region with the rest of the country.
This isolation allowed him to stay side by side.
We didn't build anything, and that's why we didn't demolish anything either, each one was just having a roof over his head.
If we have more time in Trinidad than a afternoon, then it is worth seeing also interesting places around, such as Playa Ancón Beach or the Sugar Valley.
Then, in the evening, it is customary to go to the Casa de la Música that animates itself after sunset and where the music only fades in the early morning.
Baracoa
Some refer to this village located in the Far East of Cuba as the most beautiful of the island.
This opinion is certainly already influenced by the path that leads to it.
The two roads leading from Guantánamo must cross high and rugged mountains and cross a landscape almost without any marks of human activity.
UNESCO has inscribed the Eastern Equeuil of Cuba, thanks to its intact landscape, on the list of world heritage.
We make the best chocolate there, at the church, there is the cross of Christophe Colomb (in fact, it came about a hundred years after the Colomb periple) and from the hill where you hold the old chateau-fort and the current hotel El Castillo, you see several table mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
Regarding coffee, rum, cigars, mountain massif Sierra Maestra, Truy Bay and Pinos Island, Tropical Cabaret, the shrine of the patron saint of Cuba Caridad del Copper, Santeria, African religions practiced by descendants of former slaves, about all this could be filled with pages.
But, as we say, it's better to see it once.
In Afghanistan, allies are passive, Americans say
The lack of soldiers and equipment required, according to the United States, affects the conduct of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to Defence Minister Robert Gates, NATO should outline a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not as it should be; representatives of the countries with troops in the southern part of the country were agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland.
In addition to the growing challenge by the Taliban movement, the eight States involved are also discussing future plans and the coordination of allies today.
While the United States called NATO troops into greater activity through Defence Minister Robert Gates this week, Britain sees as a priority the strengthening of Afghan government authority and the intensification of development aid.
"The evolution in Afghanistan is noticeable, but military power can only be part of the solution.
The other being to allow the inhabitants to start a new development of the economy and security themselves," the British Defence Minister Des Browne told BBC.
Ninety per cent
The activity of the Afghan insurgents is, according to US military data, the most intense of the last five years.
The number of violent actions increased by 27 per cent compared to last year, up to 60 per cent in Helmand Province, south of the country.
NATO countries have about 40 thousand soldiers in Afghanistan, almost a quarter of them in the southern part.
However, according to the United States, allies have reached their absolute limit and in the organization and equipment of troops.
In concrete terms, they request other helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan troops.
"We need to think seriously about the concrete objectives for the coming period, as well as how to achieve them," Gates said.
The NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop has made similar remarks today.
"I am not happy with what we have on earth and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we would need, and that's not enough," De Hoop told Reuters at the end of the talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo that would last three days.
Who is passive
The last few months have also been among the countries involved in conflict on the issue if all allies are doing their best in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany has been criticized for its passivity.
"The Germans have a relatively large representation in Afghanistan.
But they are engaged in areas where violence is minimal, the combat requirements they are subject to are not as stringent as those in the South and East parts of the country where we operate," Gates said.
British tabloid Sun qualified German soldiers as lazy this week.
"The Afghan fans discovered: the Germans play, while our men fight," Sun wrote in a document supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German newspaper Bild went to the counterattack by posting a picture of a British army during a rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
The State's debt will rise to one billion in 2009
The debt burden of the State exceeding 84,000 crowns is borne by each Czech.
The total debt rose to 842.7 billion krona at the end of September.
The government had planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
As a result of a better than anticipated state budget savings, the Department has reduced the amount to $152.8 billion.
The State of the Czech Republic's debt rose towards the end of September to 842.7 billion krona.
During the nine months of this year it has therefore increased by 40.2 billion krona.
As of June, however, it has decreased by 13.4 billion krona.
Today, the Ministry of Finance has confirmed its debt data from early October.
The burden of a debt exceeding 84,000 crowns is borne by each Czech.
Throughout the past year, the state has owed over 111 billion crowns.
"At the moment, it appears that, thanks to a lesser deficit expected for next year, one could cross the border of a billion crowns only in 2009.
Next year, the debt is expected to be between 900 billion and one billion crowns," said Patria Finance Analyst David Marek for the iHNed.cz server.
Next Finance Analyst Vladimir Pikor's forecast is similar: "We could exceed the billion in 2009.
The precise date will depend on the next budget that is not yet known.
If it appeared that the political situation changed, that policies were ready to save more, the date could be postponed by 2010.
But I don't expect this change," he said.
Debts grow
The debt of the State consists of the debts of the central government and is mainly generated by the accumulation of deficits in the state budget.
The State's debt is financed by treasury bills, securities, direct borrowings or, for example, by borrowings from the European Investment Bank.
The state's domestic debt increased this year from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion krona.
The State's external debt increased this year from 1.7 billion krona to 123.3 billion krona.
The debt of the so-called negotiable State reached the end of September 803.3 billion krona and from June it decreased by 13.7 billion krona.
The average debt requirement of the State was 6.5 years.
"The total debt increased annually from the first to the third half of 13 per cent, which is, given the current good health of the economy, a very high figure.
It is interesting that the increase is generated mainly by the rent titles where it reaches 20 percent.
It is wrong for debt to grow, but on the other hand this indicates that there will be something to be negotiated when retirement reform comes," Pikora commented.
Better than we expected
As a result of the state debt financing and management strategy for 2007, the government had planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
At the beginning of September, as a result of a better than anticipated state budget savings, the department reduced the amount of $152.8 billion.
The sum consists mainly of the government budget deficit, which clearly amounts to 76 billion krona this year, instead of the initial 91.3 billion krona.
These are then the maximum sources planned for the Czech Consolidation Agency, namely 13.3 billion krona, the 10 billion reserve for pension payments, the financing of state-owned securities for 43 billion krona and the repayments of European Investment Bank loans amounting to 1.8 billion krona.
She was comparing before a court today in Khartoum for naming a teddy bear
The British teacher who was tried in the Sudan for insults to Islam was sentenced Thursday night by a court in Khartoum to 15 days' imprisonment and expulsion, said her lawyer.
The British was accused of letting students between 6 and 7 years of age give the name of Muhammad to a teddy bear while any representation of the prophet of Islam is wrong.
She was liable for a whipping sentence.
This 54-year-old British teacher at the Khartoum High School Unit in Sudan was arrested on Sunday at her home and charged with assault on Islam and seditation under section 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code following several complaints by parents of students to the Ministry of Education.
The story actually goes back to September, when this teacher asks her 6/7-year-old students to choose a name for the teddy bear of the class.
"Eight names come out of the mouth of children, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed," says school director Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a vote in the class, 20 out of 23 children chose Mohamed as their preferred first name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common first name in Sudan.
The children then produced a book for the class with the photo of the bears followed by the legend "My name is Mohamed".
The bear itself did not bear any label with that name, but the problem is simply that of the representation of the prophet considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' Muslim colleagues, a teacher at the same school in the Sudan, said he knew her well and that she would never have done anything that could be insulting to a religious faith, "I just regret that she asked the children to vote for a name," he said it was just an "innocent mistake".
Opinions shared by many of the institute's students who describe her as "very attentive to her students" and "who never talk about religion in class".
Remember that the first name Mohamed is also the second most given name in Britain, he writes of English in 14 different ways.
This first name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules concerning the use of this last name?
Can we, for example, give it to a toy?
This, of course, is a question of interpretation.
They did not reach agreement on the future status of the province on Wednesday at the last negotiating session in Vienna.
In the end, I failed.
Kosovo Serbs and Albanians finished Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, a sixth and final discussion session without being able to overcome their differences on the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that the parties were unable to reach an agreement on status," said European Ombudsman Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
Emphasizing that peace in the region was "at stake", his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their commitments to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
"We don't expect immediate violence, but we're entering a very difficult time," he added, "that there are obvious tensions."
End of mediation on 10 December
Troika mediators, which brings together the European Union, the United States and Russia, will last Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the province populated by 90% of Albanian-speaking people could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko will report to the United Nations Security Council by December 10.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and final session of negotiations since the Troika was entrusted with a new mediation by the United Nations last August.
Americans and Europeans consider their mediation to be completed on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already blocked the granting of independence in Kosovo from the Security Council, insist on further negotiations beyond that deadline.
"Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," said Botsane-Khartchenko.
Declaration of unilateral independence?
After eight years of Kosovo's Honduran administration, the West believes that independence under EU supervision is the only viable solution.
Pristina said she was prepared to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council did not decide in her favour.
Belgrade insists on greater autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been found," said the President of Kosovo's autonomous authority Fatmir Sejdiu, at the Baden hotel where these "last chance negotiations" have been taking place since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, expressed his regrets.
But he added that Belgrade's self-government plan "was part of a past that led to murders and deportations".
‘Domino effect’
Serbian President Boris Tadic, on the other hand, felt that a compromise was always possible, warning the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the province's independence.
Belgrade says, in particular, to redougate a "domino effect" in an area still fragile by the wars of independence of the 1990s.
"For Serbia, he said, this does not mean that a compromise is impossible."
On Tuesday, his delegation had insisted that any decision should be brought back exclusively to the Security Council, where its Russian ally had a veto right.
'The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word'
"Only one solution within the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia," said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
"These negotiations lasted two years.
They must end as they began: in the Security Council."
To the journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had replied that "the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the status", adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanians would be "in consultation" with the West.
Bush breaks an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced, at the opening of the international peace conference convened by his attention on Tuesday in Annapolis, in Maryland, that the Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to begin negotiations immediately with a view to finding a definitive settlement of the 60-year-old litigation between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything he could to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, Palestinians must dismantle "terrorist infrastructures" and Israel must put an end to its colonization activities, Bush said, recalling both parties' obligations to the "road map" for the peace they accepted in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would aim "to conclude a peace treaty resolving all outstanding issues, without exception, including central issues".
This call covers the three thorny problems at the heart of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees driven from their homes in what is now the State of Israel during the 1948 conflict.
Taking the floor after the American president, Abbas insisted that the forthcoming negotiations be "global and thorough" and address all aspects of a settlement, citing "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among others".
In turn, Olmert pledged that the upcoming talks should be "direct and continuous" and that "an effort should be made to wrap them up in the current of 2008".
By the end of 2008, Bush fixed the deadline for implementing its co-existing "two Palestinian and Israeli "vision".
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had made a commitment to Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is the origin of a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, which proposes peace to Israel in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it tackles the roots of the conflict and its central aspects," says Prince Saud in his interview with Saudi capital-based Arabophone daily.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always in this diverse type of fact, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the National Police Inspectorate (IGPN), a police car was on Sunday, shortly after 17 hours, Louise-Michel Street, in Villiers-le-Bel.
"She was not in intervention but in patrol, and circulated at 40-50 km/h, without gyrophare," explains a police source.
A green bike of the Kawazaki brand, "not approved, therefore not allowed to drive on the public road" (read below) and driven by two young without helmets, circulated "to very much bright".
"She hit the police car on her left, after a refusal of priority to the right," says a police officer.
The control of alcohol on the occupants of the vehicle was negative.
The state of the car (before defuse, starry windshield, torn-off bumpers) testifies to the violence of the shock.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that he had entrusted an investigation for "involuntary homicide and non-assisted person in danger" to the IGPN, Cosisia with the Departmental Directorate of Public Safety of the Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, at a press conference, the prosecutor stated that the IGPN investigation, at this stage, was not responsible for the police.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, heard Sunday night, confirmed "the police version, namely that this mini-moto arrived relatively quickly on their left."
Yesterday, a kind of groove, probably caused by the friction of the feet on the ground, showed that the two vehicles remained sealed as the police car managed to brake.
Vehicles have been seized and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of the two victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened right after?
Yesterday, a rumor quickly circulated in Villiers-le-Bel, according to which police officers would have quickly left the premises, thus providing no help to the two young people.
While remaining cautious, the IGPN would also avoid "every serious fault" concerning this point.
"This is an aspect of the more difficult investigation, which requires more research, on which we must be very cautious," said a police source.
Liberation met with an eyewitness of these few moments that followed the accident.
One of his windows giving exactly on the stage.
"We're going down immediately, with my cousin who's a nurse at the hospital, trying to hurt them, says this witness.
There was nothing to be done."
He then saw "a fully falsified policeman, who was boxing.
Two others were trying to revive one of the young people, the fourth was talking on the phone."
Faced with the tension that soon surrounded the scene, and, apparently, with the certainty that the people present had the unexpected situation of young people, the police were taken by car by colleagues who arrived at the scene.
Always according to this witness, relief arrived "about twenty minutes after the departure of the police".
They also practiced cardiac massages in vain.
"I will not let you say that police services have not provided assistance to young people.
These young people have been rescued.
Firefighters arrived right away.
Everything has been done to try to save them," said the prosecutor.
Tension mounts in Pakistan
Pakistan police suppressed the first demonstrations on Monday since the establishment of the state of emergency two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the city of Lahore, in the eastern part of the country, about 2,000 lawyers who protested against the measures taken in the context of the state of emergency were injured by the tearproof grenades used by the law enforcement forces, according to witnesses.
The latter were thrown back by stone jets, wounding police officers.
At least 350 lawyers were questioned.
Similar scenarios in Karachi and Rawalpindi, or police officers charged and injured lawyers.
Several were reportedly questioned.
In Islamabad, the Supreme Court Bar lawyers called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, following a wave of some 500 arrests during the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets giving access to the Supreme Court were blocked Monday morning to prevent the gathering.
Other demonstrations would have taken place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (north-west).
The lawyers' movement gathered on Monday the support of the religious parties in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, whose president '' urged the people to send flowers to the judges who declared themselves against the state of emergency and to those who swore oath before Musharraf''.
''The promise of Musharraf no longer holds''
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly subject to the exceptional measure proclaimed on Saturday evening.
It was due in the coming days to decide on the legality of the re-election to the Presidential on 6 October, to indirect suffrage of President Musharraf.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was drafted and replaced.
''All that we are witnessing is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to Supreme Court judgments'', the magistrate told the newspaper The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the army's head and become a civilian president ''holds it no longer'' after the establishment of the state of emergency, said the Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeem on Monday.
He was expected to leave his military uniform by 15 November, the date of the end of his first presidential term.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government has denied strong rumors in the country that President Musharraf would have been assigned to residence by his Deputy Chief of the Armed Forces.
More than one third of pregnancies remain unintended
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as unplanned or unexpected births.
Even today, more than one in three (36%) pregnancy is not expected, reveals a study conducted by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the vote on the Neuwirth Act, which liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as unplanned or unexpected births.
Different methods of contraception such as pill or sterile still present a failure rate of 5% to 6%, Ined estimates.
At the same time, the liberalization of contraception has allowed for a better "fertility control", according to the institute which notes that the rate of use of the pill in women aged 20 to 44 has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight out of ten births would be well planned today.
See calculated next month for one couple out of five and if possible in the spring, season considered the most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
It would have taken more than seven hours of space work for astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crewmates at the International Space Station (ISS) to perform the spectacular repair of a torn solar panel, indispensable to the continuation of the station's scientific activities.
A risky output that accumulated the records due to its duration, its remoteness from the living modules, the speed with which it was imagined, tools "bricked" by astronauts to perform the repair.
The problem appeared Tuesday while astronauts had unloaded Discovery from the shuttle the Harmony module, a large cylindrical part to accommodate European and Japanese scientific laboratories soon (see box).
This module is a kind of catchment dock for the modules-laboratories.
But we need to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to move an electricity generation module by solar panels weighing 17.5 tons, already present on the ISS, in order to put it on its final position.
After moving it, the crew began the redeployment of solar panels from the module with a width of 76 metres.
And that's where one of the panels, which unfolds like accordions, was damaged on close to one metre by a cable that stuck.
The deployment was stopped to avoid further damage to the panel.
The astronauts, who originally had to make a check out of the Discovery shuttle, then went to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to dedicate themselves to the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to go caracolate at the end of the 30 meters length of the remote control arm of the shuttle added to that of the station to perform the repair.
He is one of Nasa's best spacewalker.
Great, resistant, very appropriate, it has the very developed torso and long arms.
At 46 years of age, this training physician was therefore charged with "operating" the "injured" solar panel.
After precisely inspecting the damage, he sectioned the fault cable and installed some types of "athletes" on the damaged area.
He was assisted by a second "spacewalker" staying close to his and, from the inside, by other astronauts, including Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini-cane of insulating hockey to avoid electrocution on solar panels producing several hundred volts, was designed and "bricked" by astronauts aboard the station.
Once the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before making the inventory of its tools and returning to the inside of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, astronauts took advantage of a half-day of relaxation before today, seven astronauts return to the Discovery shuttle for a return to Earth planned for Wednesday.
The EADS title sanctioned in the Stock Exchange
The EADS action is currently falling sharply to the Paris Stock Exchange, after the aircraft and defence group announced that it would have to spend between 1.2 billion and 1.4 billion euros to cope with the delays of the A400M.
EADS loses 4% to 21.96 euros currently at the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to review its operational result forecast for 2007 due to delays resulting from the slow development of the A400M engine, which conditiones the aircraft's inaugural flight.
The cost of countering the delay in the delivery of the military aircraft, announced in October, is between €1.2 billion and €1.4 billion, of which more than $1 billion for Airbus'", announced the home of the European manufacturer EADS.
As a result of these charges, EADS will be forced to announce new operating result targets (EBIT) for 2007 when submitting its quarterly results next Thursday, he adds no further figures.
The group also indicates that the estimate of new charges is consistent with the six-month delay.
As a reminder, the operational outcome of EADS fell by 86% in 2006, mainly due to delays in another program, that of the very large A380 carrier.
Initially, the group anticipated a first delivery of A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
There will be no suspension on Sunday at the polling station: the Russians will opt massively for the party of President Putin, Russia united.
Confirming their aspirations for stability, or even authoritarianism, after a very locked campaign.
Three days after the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today sends voters a television message on public channels, already registered but whose content is kept secret.
He does so as the leader of Russia's united list, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is announced to be overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president did not let anything clear by receiving foreign ambassadors, merely giving a new charge against the West accused of interference - his theme of preference during the campaign.
"We know the price of true democracy and want honest, most transparent and open elections, free elections," he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, we are far from the count.
She denounces a campaign full of pressure.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says that there have never been such dirty elections, even in Eltsine's time.
After the repression of last weekend's demonstrations, the former chess champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstrations, remains prohibited from visiting according to his lawyer.
"The Russians have kept the mentality of the Soviet Homo"
Behind these unsustained legislation are two much more open questions:
- Who will succeed Putin in the presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the president's first tour, on 2 March 2008; the candidates had until 23 December to be announced.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot hold a third consecutive term.
But no successor emerges.
- What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Head of the parliamentary majority and of the most powerful united Russian party who would choose the government and the president?
In any case, to the legislatures and the president, the outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians have kept the mentality of the Soviet homo, they do not feel masters of their destiny," says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the Levada Independent Centre.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov of the State University of St. Petersburg goes back further: civil society has been delayed in this Christian country five centuries after Europe; the famous Community spirit has delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Putine renewed the model of a paternalist state, perfectly accepted by the population especially since this new paternalism was not followed by terror, but by a certain economic ease," says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians "will willingly renounce personal responsibility" which they had briefly demonstrated after the outbreak of the USSR.
“What good to think about?”
The phenomenon affects all social layers, including the business world.
And the administrative elite intends to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of Russia together.
The new freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
Opinion prefers stability.
In the name of which the Russians will not vote for the extremists either.
Conclusion by 54 - year - old Tamara Tcherednitchenko: “What good to think about?
Those in power are not too bad, why change them?"
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which depict the destinies of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are in free access.
The 47 million archival documents, stored on 27 km of linear at Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were so far only for a "humanitarian" purpose, i.e. individually and nominally, at the request of a former victim or his entitled persons.
The eleven states in charge of their management - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to researchers and historians.
The process of ratification of this agreement by all States has been completed and has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
Access by historians to Bad Arolsen will allow for research "in particular on the displacement of prisoners, the population of camps and the health status of forced workers," says Reto Meistern, the director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, a number of States, including Germany, had opposed the opening of such nominal documents to the public because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
Such as the supposed homosexuality or the mental disability of some victims of deportation.
The registers of the concentration camps or arrest warrants established by the Gestapo had been collected after war for a practical purpose: to find civilians deported or subjected to compulsory work and, possibly, to prove their detention, in order to open the way for their compensation.
Still today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees deal with tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
"There is nothing fundamentally new to wait for these documents," said Pr Wolfgang Benz, Director of the Anti-Semitism Research Centre at the University Technische Universität in Berlin in 2006.
The EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
At present, the Indo-European bilateral trade already reaches almost EUR 60 billion a year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008 indicated the European Commissioner for Trade Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath.
The EU Foreign Ministers had given their green light to the European Commission last April to enter into negotiations to sign free trade agreements with India, South Korea and the Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean). Indo-European bilateral trade already reaches almost EUR 60 billion per year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the EU's 9th trading partner, according to figures from the European Commission.
"A huge free trade pact between the two economies" and "India would improve its access to a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans", explained Peter Mandelson.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the first ten products exported by India, said the European Commissioner. Asian and European giants exchange annually for "47 billion euros of goods" and for "10 billion euros of services", this week Daniele Smadja, head of the delegation of the European Commission to New Delhi, regretting that bilateral trade has not yet "reached its potential". The EU and India meet Friday for their eighth diplomatic summit in New Delhi in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barroso.

The Bank of England takes note of the concerns by offering 10 billion pounds every five weeks
The Bank of England expressed concern at the current return of concerns about credit conditions on Thursday, and announced an offer of ten billion pounds at the base rate of 5.75% over five weeks, an unusual duration.
"To alleviate concerns that the financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in the way they will organise their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to provide a significant proportion of its planned reserves during the maintenance period beginning on 6 December in the form of a five-week open market operation," she says in a communiqué.
The bank states that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be placed on the market on 6 December at 12H15 GMT, at the base rate and until 10 January.
This is the first time it seems that BoE puts on the cash market at five weeks in an open market operation.
These are normally done at a week.
The BoE adds in its communiqué that it is "ready to take other measures to maintain the rates" of interbank loans per day online with its basic rate.
The daily interbank rate was Wednesday 5,829%.
The three-month rate stood at 6.6%, one higher since September 18.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the amounts put on the market by the Bank of England had been accompanied by a substantial rate of penalty which had deterred banks from resorting to them.
According to some rumors, corroborated by the evolution of the book price from the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the amounts placed on the market by the European Central Bank, at more advantageous rates and with greater discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to examine PS proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and New Centre groups refused Thursday to discuss the articles of the proposal for a socialist law on purchasing power, which amounts to a rejection of the text.
The text, which was part of a socialist "nice" (on the initiative of a parliamentary group), declined by about ten measures adopted on Tuesday by the National PS Office, including the 50% increase in the employment premium, the recovery of the floating TIPP, a cheque-transport or the management of rents.
UMP and NC having voted against the examination of articles (180 to 115), the meeting was adjourned following the general discussion which resulted in exchanges, sometimes lively, between a majority and opposition a few hours from Nicolas Sarkozy's television intervention on purchasing power.
The CEO of MPs PS Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the whole of his proposals in the form of amendments to the Bill of Amending Finance considered by the Assembly next week.
A new festival sees the day
Following many rumors about the creation, by C3 Presents, of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in partnership with the Republic Festival of the British producer Melvin Benn.
"For our company, it is an honour to work with a person who has no less or less inspired the current movement of festivals in America," Charlie Jones from C3 told Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Chicago Lollapalooza festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, in New Jersey, is a summer destination for the campsite.
The festival is expected to be held from 8 to 10 August on a private farm of 500 acres approximately 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Formerly known as Mean Fiddler, the director of Festival Republic, Melvin Benn, is one of the world's most respected festival producers.
In 1989, he took over the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts some 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio and then, in 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival of Henham Park in the Suffolk.
Since 2002, as a co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Calling Glastonbury as the "most inspiring event" he has ever attended, Charlie Jones de C3 says that his business and that of Melvin Benn work in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
"We had chosen Philadelphia as a market and worked regularly with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia," says Charlie Jones.
"We were discussing this with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited by this project.
Unfortunately, we got involved in politics because of the current administration, Charlie Jones continues.
"Surely, we were able to talk with Melvin Benn and we are preparing to create a beautiful festival on an exceptional site that will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia."
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at the Grant Park in Chicago, after appearing in the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded respective gross revenues of $9.8M and $11.3M in 2007.
These two festivals are held in urban areas.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a country festival, while ours takes place in urban green spaces," says Charlie Jones.
The aim is to merge, in one way or another, the two formulas to give both an impression of a European and urban country festival to the American."
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The Vineland community, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports the holding of this event," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the terms of the agreement, but affirms "that they are interesting enough to allow investment in such an event and to host a festival that, hopefully, will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the host capacity of this festival is "very large", like that of 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He said that invitations had been launched to groups, but that nothing could be confirmed at the time of the press.
"Vineland will taste rock, but the music will be varied there, in the hope of attracting all kinds of spectators," says Charlie Jones.
His C3 partners, who received the Top Independent Award Promoting the latest Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces the Terminator
It's not easy to attract Hollywood film boards in Montreal when no other than Terminator opposes it...
This seduction mission is part of the duties of delegate.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the "runaway productions".
Is it difficult to play in the "Governator" legs?
"We must be careful, it is the industry that decides where it is going.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favourable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer those they will judge the best," he said.
The festival race
For the moment, however, Denis Turcotte's priority is to promote cinema by now.
The Oscar race has begun.
It will be of all the festivals in the West Coast, whether Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, to present the Quebec films, highlight them and ensure that the filmmakers do interviews.
The Age of Darkness had a beautiful showcase at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on display in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four feature films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a year-end rally in the stock exchange? Experts divided by the subprime crisis.
Less than five weeks after the end of the year, investors are already rubbing their hands in the hope of the traditional end-of-year rally.
However, this year experts are not as certain as they are going to happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, the month of December in the stock exchange generally has a positive attitude.
However, forecasts should not be made solely based on statistics, since given the current context, uncertainties are on the markets, at least in the short term."
Although they are not supporters for the stock exchange to be driven during the last few weeks of the year, these experts note that "the stock market is fed by the existence of liquidity, willing to invest in the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the effect of leaking to quality values both in long periods and in short periods".
For this, they believe that the grant will have rather side-by-side behaviour, not free of volatility "especially because the impact of the likely decrease in Fed rates is unknown, given the high level of gross and the danger of stimulating inflationary tensions"
Javier Barrio, responsible for BPI's sales in Spain, agrees that this is not the right time to say that there will be a rally.
"This is not the best thing," said the expert.
Ibex, the Spanish stock exchange index, has lost almost 4% since November 8, when the index closed at 15,945,7 points.
However, not all experts have such a negative view.
Juan Solana, an Intermoney analyst, believes that Ibex 35 could close the year at 16,000 points through the reorganization of portfolios and traditional contributions to pension plans that occur each year during these dates.
However, the expert nuance that things will be a little different this year since he believes that the rally will take place from the second week of December, after the bridge of the celebration of the Constitution (December 6).
The analyst does not consider that volatility will affect the market trend.
For his part, Federico Olucha, analyst of Investment Bank, assesses that we are close to technical levels and "that is why we could observe a rebounding of the index that could be caused by information coming from the European Union as regards the consequences of the crisis on the credit market".
The analyst hopes that these will be positive.
Analysts agree to choose the values that will be responsible for leading Ibex to new maximum quotas.
Solana, of Intermoney, states that "this year the great values are back to him."
The expert would include in the portfolio the two large banks and some manufacturers "because when the date approaches, the electricity sector will be very expensive."
While Federico Olucha of Investis Banco ensures that the increases will be due to the bank and the industrial sector.
Manufacturers will also be able to benefit from this rally, in case they do.
"ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we hope that other manufacturers such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path," said the expert.
The cyclical consumption will be the protagonist in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technological enterprises will do so as well, although in this case there is not much representation on the Spanish market.
Five times for seven years
During the last seven years, only two occasions in December were a month low.
The genuine year-end rally took place in 2003, during which the stock market came out of the crisis caused by the growth of the technological bubble.
This year, during which Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, the month of December recorded an increase of 6.68%.
It will be necessary to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of earnings (at the moment Ibex has increased by 8.36 per cent since January) and if it succeeds in computerizing its end-year rally.
The People's Bank will open 200 offices open 12 hours from Monday to Saturday
The People's Bank has decided to renew a large part of its offices.
A total of 200 banks are located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Popular Max brand, represent a major change for the bank.
Also for the rest of Spanish agencies, since it was the first group that decided to start betting on the uninterrupted opening of its agencies until 8:30 p.m. and to open on Saturday from 10:00 to 20:30.
Another group that has also repeated several times that he would like to amplify the schedules of his branches, BBVA, even though he has not yet decided to take the first step.
It is about to conclude an agreement with the unions to close 75% of its agencies on Saturday instead of opening one afternoon, but not to the public.
The results of the Popular Bank's experience will be decisive for other organizations to adhere to this initiative that coincides with trade schedules.
This is precisely what the People's Bank is looking for.
Attract autonomous customers who travel in these areas to make their purchases in SMEs and street businesses selected to open.
The bank wants to open these 200 agencies established throughout Spain in about 18 months, since it is not about opening new agencies but about renewing existing ones.
For this purpose, the organization will modernize the branches it already has in commercial areas, adapting them to the customer profile of the different streets.
In this way, the amplification of the schedules is accompanied by a different design of the inside of the branch and a new, more current design, with brighter colors.
The Bank Trade Manager, Ángel Rivera, ensures that this renovation does not involve large investments, but hiring staff, as the number of employees will increase from six to eight or nine per agency.
The agencies, which will also have spaces for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
The Popular Bank has already tested its initiative in three agencies in Madrid.
And the experience was positive, as Ángel Rivero explains.
The branches of Murillo Brave, O'Donnell and the Gran Vía in Madrid are the streets to be chosen, and apparently with success, according to Rivero.
The Popular Bank currently owns 2,500 branches.
And 60 others who operate under the brand Mundocredit, specialized in the case of immigrants, also with very broad schedules, which even open Sunday and holidays.
In these PopularMax agencies they will not copy the BBVA model, where many of its agencies have a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
'We don't want to compete with our customers,' said Rivero.
For the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with an external staff at the bank.
Telecinco twice for the first time the value in the Stock Exchange of its rival Antena 3
We got there.
With this phrase Paolo Vasile, a CEO of Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction yesterday at the closure of the stock market, when he found that the chain he led doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
One aspect was his joy: 'What hurts me, it is not the fact that we have increased but that we have decreased less,' he said.
However, he stressed that in a low market, 'we have dropped less'.
Telecinco finished the day yesterday with an increase of 2.54%.
This gain has stabilized its loss to 15.66% for one year.
The value in Stock Exchange of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and announced by Vocento (13% more) thus reaches €4,488.88 million, according to Bloomberg data.
Its rival Antena 3, who gave in yesterday 1.52% and accumulated a decrease of 40.5% since January, costs half, 2,193.46 million.
The value of the other communications companies listed in the Stock Exchange amounts to 3,571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2,518.53 million in that of Prisa (the publisher of Cinco Días) and 1,779 million in that of Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenne 3 is due to the fact that we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact represents what we are able to do on the same market at what price and how we cost it in terms of hearing '.
Telecinco announced last week that he plans to become this year the first television channel to exceed the 1,000 million gross advertising revenues, as stated by Giuseppe Tringali, the CEO of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the subsidiary that manages the advertising of the group.
In order for this to be actual, the television channel should record for the current fiscal year an increase of 3.6 per cent in its advertising billing compared to the 965.4 million in the financial year 2006.
For its part, Antenna 3's net billing increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (up to 734.4 million) while net TV revenues increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point to the best relative evolution of Telecinco in the Stock Exchange is the important pay out it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile ensures that, although it is early to make a decision, this ratio may vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol and in association with Mediaset.
'We have the official compromise to give for a minimum of 50 per cent, although we have always said much more.
This year, I hope we will be able to make our shareholders happy, those to whom we have already given titles with the 33% of Endemol'.
According to analysts, the market is currently giving signs of fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its profit estimates on Telecinco in 2008 to 4 per cent and in 2009 to 7%.
This is due, they explain, to the expected decline in income growth from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
The same company reduced the forecast of Antenne 3 to 4.5% gains in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.
3 opinions
1.
Ibersecurities recommends that the two values be purchased based primarily on their high return on dividends and long-term sustainable potential.
2.
The Caja Madrid sees Telecinco better (accumulate) than Antenna 3 (maintain) for the multiple attractions ' and the increase in business.
3.
JPMorgan: it recommends examining both cases since it has had 'like threats' (a saturated market and a bad economic climate).
Congress approves the Mifid transposition, which entered into force on 1 November
In parallel with its parliamentary formality, which ended today with the Congress's vote on amendments incorporated into the draft in the Senate, the Government has submitted to a public hearing the regulations that will develop the new law, with the objective of its entry into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the various groups agreed to highlight the effort made by members of Parliament and senators to negotiate and consent to the best regulation capable of ensuring investor protection and to regulate in detail the activity of organizations to ensure that markets operate effectively.
The Mifid, which amends the Value Market Act, involves the modernization of financial markets, as it strengthens investor protection, improves the powers of leaders of the National Securities Market Commission (NCMV) and promotes cooperation between the different leaders of the European Union.
The new regulation will provide financial consultation services both for specialized social reasons as well as for natural or legal persons and create a new type of financial services (SIS), financial consultation companies (FIAs), which merge with securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies.
In addition, it increases the number of systems for the execution of transactions on financial instruments, so that it is possible to add multilateral trading systems and international order systems to regulated secondary markets, which compete with current stock exchange managers.
The Act also obliges investment service companies to disclose on the market information on key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and risk management forms, and requires them to keep a register of all operations they carry out, to facilitate control by the CNMV.
By passing through the Congress's Economy Commission, several amendments have been added, one of which shows that the debt holders will be considered as a "complex" financial instrument given their high risk to the investor, which proved with what happened with the US debt of high-risk (subprime).
In addition, they took advantage of the management's transposition to legally delimit the functions that graduates in Economy may have 30 years after the approval of the Royal Decree in 1977 delimiting the professional functions reserved for economists.
For its part, the Senate has incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as that of the mediator, who will work on behalf of a company, which will not require the approval of the CNMV and who will be able to provide its services for the marketing of products and attracting new customers to different investment firms at the same time.
The harmonised consumer price index increases by five tenths in November, up to 4.1%
This indicator, which then serves Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides a balance sheet on price developments in Spain during November.
Its publication responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) by providing data comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same process as that used for the Harmonized Consumer Price Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate the information not yet available at the time of publication.
INE recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator is only indicative, because it does not necessarily have to coincide with the final data that will be revealed on December 14.
"The IPC will continue on relatively high levels"
The second Vice-President and Economy Minister Pedro Solbes stated that the increase of 4.1% of the CPI in November is a "temporal figure", but at the same time he predicted that the price index will continue on "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes stated in the corridors of Congress that "although the figure is not good" Spain's inflation differential regarding monetary union continues to be "more or less" the same as in recent years.
He also explained that in November "there was less surprise" than in the previous month, when the Government did not face such a high increase.
"We were hoping for a figure of around 4%," acknowledged the Minister of Economy in relation to today's announced data.
Virgin plans to recover with Northern Rock 42,000 million euros over three years
Northern Rock deposits have fallen to more than 50% to £12,000 (16,800 million) since it went into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency credit from the Bank of England.
At the time, he had a few record deposits above 25,000 million pounds, a figure that was gradually dropped in two and a half months because of the mistrust of his clients and despite the 100% guarantee of that money that the Government had offered and that he would maintain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, who would fame the organization with her financial trade mark Virgin Money, needs to capture about a quarter of the British banks' revenues that will be deposited in the next three years to obtain the remaining 18,000 million pounds until reaching the target of the $30,000 million.
The group of magnate Richard Branson, known for his advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) per year on advertising and marketing to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock named this week the offer of the Virgin Association, in which three other companies participate, including his favorite to save him from the highway.
The mayor of Totana was arrested for an alleged urban corruption plot
The Civil Guard arrested today early in the morning the current mayor of the Murcian municipality of Totana (the People's Party) because of its alleged relationship with the urban corruption plot discovered this week.
In addition, one of the municipal council's secretaries and the Chief of Police of the municipality were also arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced the me of last May Juan Morales, the current right-wing Member, and until then municipal councillor of the city hall, and which according to the sources of the investigation consulted by the SER Chain, could be the 'lesser' of this plot.
Officers continue to search the municipal premises and those of the Council of Urbanism and the possibility of further arrests is not excluded within the next few hours.
In addition, Juan Morales' lawyer, the main suspect of the urban corruption plot, discovered at the beginning of this week, was charged.
As indicated yesterday by the SER Chain to the lawyer of the MP 'of the popular party' Juan Morales, he was arrested by leaving the home of Morales with important documentation in his possession of the plot.
Furthermore, according to sources of the investigation, the purpose of the investigation is the alleged cash flow of Morales commissions in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a Galicia construction company to qualify 200 hectares of land.
For the time being, there are eight persons in custody.
Bono agrees to be the head of the Spanish Socialist Party's candidacy for Toledo and to preside over Congress if they win the elections
The former Minister of Defence José Bono accepted the offer of the President of the Government and the Secretary General of Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to head the list of the Spanish Socialist Party for Toledo for the next general elections and to be President of Congress in the event that the Socialists will win the general elections.
Thus the secretary of organization of the Spanish Socialist Party, José Blanco, and Bono himself announced it during a press conference after the meeting that took place this noon at the federal seat of this party with Zapatero.
The Chief Executive justified the offer made to the former Minister because "it is important to rely on the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
Furthermore, he stressed that "yes it seems" that the political man of La Manche will be the candidate of the socialist group who will preside over the Congress if the socialists win the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as President of Congress, who made his decision on November 15th not to present himself at the next general elections and to abandon his political career in the fight against climate change within the academic framework.
The former Minister acknowledged that the President of the Government has not ceased to insist that he return to the political front office since he abandoned him two years ago.
Furthermore, he noted that, although citizens already know who will be the economic vice-president if the Spanish socialist party wins the elections, his party wanted to announce the president of the Congress, in an "act of transparency".
If he reaches the position, Bono hopes to turn the House into "a house of respect and not insult or cry" and make "it more and more like citizens".
"Sometimes it seems regrettable that the only local Madrid where we cannot speak calmly and calmly is Congress, the President of the Government in the Senate on certain occasions has been interrupted 26 times."
In the same way, he had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and "I know how to do" and he did not want to act as if he was already occupying his position so as not to fall, as he pointed out, in what his opponents might consider "a domination".
Climate Propaganda
Since the movement against climate change is subject to relentless persecution both the sceptics of its predictions and those that give priority to other political and social battles, it must demonstrate iron coherence.
It is all the more the case for a leader of the movement who is the President of the Government like Zapatero and who believes that this struggle is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and even plans to sign a "new contract for the planet".
This approach requires him to explain why his Government's action, or inaction, has contributed decisively to Spain's leadership in the non-implementation of the Kyoto Protocols.
Who are responsible for non-implementation, in which sectors has occurred, and why his Government, the one in the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
In addition, it must clearly explain to the Spanish what measures it will take to curb climate change.
What companies will be affected, what habits of citizens will have to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings will be forced on us to do, what economic consequences will it cause.
That is, who will sacrifice himself and who will pay to save the planet.
But there was no explanation and there will be no explanation.
Precisely because it's about sacrificing and paying.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Cost-effective, uncomfortable and threatening for business and individual accounts.
Up to the hundredth of the essence suggested by the Spanish Socialist Party seemed to him so readically dangerous to Zapatero that he was quick to deny it.
That is, it is about saving the planet with nothing, only with propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With sentences having impact, committees, committees, protocols, new posts.
With these contracts with the planet, this gentleman so useful for election campaigns that he does not speak, does not denounce and does not demand, beautifies the meetings and inspires tenderness.
As long as this is limited to being a purely virtual Contracting Party and does not claim that we are travelling by bicycle or refreshing ourselves with the range.
Mayor and local police chief of Totana arrested for an alleged urban corruption plot
The Spanish gendarmerie arrested the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the chief of the local police, the mayor's secretary and a suspicious hotel contractor for possible urban crimes, today informed the sources of the investigation.
The city councillor was arrested at his home and taken to the city hotel, where at the moment many agents met, who also presented themselves to the Municipal Council Service of Urbanism and the municipal management company of the Land Industry and Housing.
These three judgments are in addition to the six judgments made last Monday in the provinces of Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation relating to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land to urbanise them so that the Galician company Nuaria can build 4,000 dwellings after the payment of illegal commissions during the last legislature.
In addition, two other persons have not been arrested but are charged with the judicial investigation, which the Tribunal No. 1 of Totana instructs.
The first six detainees have now moved to a judicial provision.
According to sources, the previous municipal councillor of Totana and currently autonomous MP of the PP party, Juan Morales, is targeted by the investigation.
In addition, the former woman, owner of a real estate agency currently registered in Totana, was charged, as well as the current fiancée of the former municipal councillor, who lives in Murcia.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and contractor of Vigo (Galice) Manuel N.A. were arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M.G., director of Suelo de Immonuar, agency of the Nuaria Group, and through which the wine pots would have been made.
The investigation is carried out by the Urban Crimes Group of the Central Operational Unit (UCO) of the gendarmerie whose officers, in addition to the arrests, carried out eleven inspections, the majority in companies related to detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcie, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
So a single person was arrested in Totana, in short, the owner of a well-known poultry company in the region, which could have played the role of intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for the development of the largest residential complex in the Murcian municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 dwellings, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company has acquired 2,2 million square metres of land in Totana, which has been requalified and its project would require doubling the population of the municipality, which currently has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group consists of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which deal with the real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages the parking lot of Vigo in the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and the square of Fernando el Católica; Hogartel, who deals with direct marketing; Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and installation of construction elements.

Our Finnish correspondent provides us with the commentary published yesterday in Finland's most important newspaper (certain PISA above the educational level in the world), Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day it appeared there, curiously, the criticism of Blackburn's book:
"The content of the course of Philosophy questioned public opinion as a result of the tragedy of Jokela's school.
The culprit of the dead, a bachelor's student, cited in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Education Advisor responsible for Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded that teachers adopt a critical attitude towards Plato on what is written in the pages of the daily Helsingin Sanomat and stated that studying Nietzsche is not essential in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in high schools."

A colleague passes the information on the introduction into the Criminal Code of Offences on Internet Downloads:
A. Downloading a song would be a crime punishable by six months to one year.
On the other hand, theft in a CD store of less than EUR 400 is regarded as a fault only (Article 623.1).
B. The theft in a store for up to 1,000 euros is already considered a crime, but the penalty is less than the penalty for downloading (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty is less than the penalty for downloading (an article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the traffic of compact discs.
Participating in a tumultuous fight involves a sentence of three months to one year (Article 154 of the Criminal Code) and trafficking in CDs would involve a sentence of six months to two years
(art. 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a film, according to article 184.2 of the Criminal Code.
F. The distribution of copyright-protected and unauthorized films is more punishable than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (art. 186).
Finally, if my colleague is in the real then someone exaggerates.

My doctor told me about one of his articles on strange research entitled 'Money produces brain activations, especially if others receive less'.
In other words, the feelings generated by the monthly pay of workers depend on what colleagues earn.
The study was carried out through magnetic tomographic resonances at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the last issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author and director of the neurocognition imaging group at the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: "The strongest activation occurred when the participant answered correctly and his partner failed."
The researchers observed that when both people came to receive the same pay, activation was moderate, but if one of them received the double, activation was greater.
I don't know if that conclusion required so much science.
Prosecutor of the Balkans
For eight years Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly pursuing the Balkan war criminals since the Public Prosecutor's Office of the Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, located in The Hague.
His term ends at the end of the year and Carla will leave with bitter taste, because the main perpetrators of the murder of Srebrenica - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims have died -, former general Ratko Mladic and former Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic, are still free.
Their names are on this list whose documentary by the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach takes its title, 'the list of Carla' (2006), not designed exclusively in Spain), with the rhythm of a police thriller, which follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor of Belgrade in New York who continues the fugitives and pressures the Governments involved to narrow the circle.
What assurance do I have?
Car insurance, which covers the driver in the face of possible disasters, involves a significant expenditure that will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, age of driving licence, marital status, type of vehicle to be insured or the use that is actually done, among others.
Having a car is the main thing.
And it's just, choosing the right car insurance is even harder than choosing the vehicle model.
And it's that, choosing the right car insurance, is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurer.
This compromise is materialized by an insurance contract, which establishes that the company receives the value of the premium granted and in exchange it becomes responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a disaster.
The premium is the price of insurance, which is based on various factors, such as age, sex, seniority of driving licence, marital status, type of vehicle to be ensured or used, among others.
Insurance companies determine their prices based on statistics, so that the higher the likelihood of an accident, the higher the rate to be paid.
This is why people over the age of 25 and women must pay lower premiums, as statistics show that these people have a lower rate of disasters than their caution.
Similarly, using censuses, companies have concluded that married persons tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will influence the frequency, and thus the likelihood of an accident.
By increasing the frequency the probability increases.
They are many variables that insurers take into account when determining the premium price.
For this reason, the driver needs to study the situation to choose the car insurance that best suits his profile.
We will present here the most significant variables when choosing one type of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insurer, offers a reasonable price.
Young people under 25 years of age face various disadvantages when entering into an affordable insurance contract, such as low driving experience and seniority of driving licences.
Although the ideal to be well-insured is a risk insurance, other more economical options exist.
The most likely drivers can opt for free insurance so that they can obtain insurance coverage at any risk but at a more affordable price.
This form of agreement implies that the customer pays part of the amount of the claim.
"The portion of the amount of the claim that the customer pays will be established according to the value of the premium, which will be higher the amount will be lower," says Luis Noguera, head of First Europa, online insurance broker in Spain.
Another option is extended third-party insurance, so that the customer provides protection to deal with damage caused to third parties, but by those caused on his own car.
In addition, it would be covered against theft, fires and loss of the vehicle.
A piece of advice.
If you are under 25, try to be cautious and avoid disasters as far as possible, as this will affect the bonus, which can reduce the price of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction in the company's basic fare.
On the contrary, a penalty is an increase in the basic rate.
"The bonuses and sanctions will depend on the company and its profit.
If the company had a good year it could afford to increase the bonuses," Noguera clarified.
Over the age of 25, this becomes easier for drivers when entering into a contract with insurance, as the rate of damages is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
That is why it is preferable to choose insurance at all risks with honesty.
"Usually, young people cannot take advantage of the experience acquired prior to an accident," says the director of the European company in Spain, adding that the majority of accidents occur during the second year of driving, once the 'novice' has passed.
However, if the client is married but has not yet had children, it is preferable that he negotiates insurance at any risk, as his economic situation permits him.
Marriages with children are considered by insurers as people with the lowest rate of claims, because increases will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be a risk insurance at all costs (possibly EUR 300), or an extended third-party insurance from the third year of the vehicle's life when the insured person has a high level of bonus.
"They are more casual and they have greater purchasing power to afford the luxury of assuming a larger amount of franchises," Justice Luis Noguera said.
For pensioners, a risk insurance with franchise is preferable (which is EUR 150), or an extended third-party insurance when the insurer has a high level of bonus.
It must be said that car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver in the face of possible disasters, but also because it represents an important expense, that is why it is essential to study properly the insurance that suits us most according to our personal situation.
Celtic will try to win a point in Milan to reach the eighth final
The Milan AC and Celtic Glasgow are next Tuesday in San Siro looking for the point that they lack to achieve their respective goals in closing the Champions League, as it serves the Italians to be first and Scottish to qualify.
The Italians total ten points and have already qualified during the fifth day thanks to a zero match in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow has nine points, but it still needs another point to make sure that the Shakhtar Donetsk, who has six, and who receives Benfica who has four, does not pass to him.
These two Group D matches will be played a week before the sixth day ends, since Milan AC has to fight the semi-finals of the World Cup of Clubs in Japan on 13 this month in search of a place for the final of December 16.
Thus, this group will remain closed before the zero game at Giuseppe Meazza stage seems to be the most expected result, although the two teams will try to get out victorious, since the Italians will not want to speculate at home and the Celtic Glasgow knows that winning it would stay first and ensure a better crossing in the eighth finals.
A defeat of Gordon Strachan's team could be enough to rank if the Shakhtar Donetsk doesn't win, but it won't be able only to computer on it because with nine points the game goes back to the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but who won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milanese will try to poison the evening to the Scottish, who have good hope to rank for the eighth finals for the second time at the Champions League, after being beaten during the last edition by a goal of Kaka during the extensions (1-0).
Pending the victory of the 'rossoneri' the triumph would only return to Shakhtar, in case Celtic would lose, to qualify for the eighth finals in order to continue the league of UEFA champions.
And it is that Benfica, although it is last and without the possibility of continuing the European competition, could reach third place with a victory.
20,000 people attending the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver
The Spice Girls began in Vancouver, Canada, before approximately 20,000 spectators, their first tour since the group disbanded in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) stated shortly before starting their concert at the GM Place in Vancouver that the group meeting is "bright".
Around 20,000 people exhausted the tickets to attend the concert which was the subject of a video in which the history of the group that raged at the end of 1990s is told.
The meeting and the world tour coincide with the launch of a new album that resumes their main successes as well as two new songs, ' Heads' and ' Voodoo', published by EMI in Spain.
The five members of the Spice Girls were on stage showing the bracelets offered by the 'Posh Spice' husband, British footballer David Beckham.
The sportsman was in the audience that filled GM Place, even though Victoria had banned him a few days earlier.
Before the opening of the show, Victoria Beckham noted that the British footballer "did not see our costumes so I'm nervous because I don't know what he'll think of the show".
'Sporty Spice' who was part of the group in 1998 "because of differences between us" and which caused the group to dissolve two years later, also expressed its nervousness during an interview with the press, two hours before the beginning of the show.
"I was scared.
I was nervous but I saw that people's feelings have changed, the feeling for Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought why not, I'm glad I made a decision," Chisholm said about the group meeting that she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noticed that over time, "things have been arranged and we appreciate each other very much".
But many things have changed since the Spice Girl last exhibited in 1998.
To begin with, according to CTV television, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special plane from Virgin Airlines.
Upon their arrival at the airport, a baby sitter army was waiting for them.
She has five seven sons.
After the Vancouver concert, the group will be exhibited in California, USA, San José(December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5-7th).
In Madrid they will be exhibited on 23 December.
The new gas case between Russia and Ukraine throws the alarm.
A debate on the price of fermented gas between Ukraine and Russia thus increasing the risk of impact on fuel exports to Europe.
Most Russian gas exports to the European Union (EU) are consigned by pipelines, and each pipeline is scrupulously monitored.
Kiev announced that if Russia increases the cost of fuel, it will increase transit fees to Russia.
Last year, an altercation between the two had caused a decrease in supplies to the U.S. countries.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow occurs after the Ukrainian government and Gazprom, a Russian-owned monopoly company providing gas, tried in vain to find agreement on the cost of Russian gas supplied to Ukraine for 2008.
Gazprom stated that it would increase as expected, its prices in Ukraine as it agreed to pay for 2008 up to 50% more for the supply of gas from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts stated that this would involve Ukraine, an increase of 40% of the costs of imports from Gazprom.
"It is essential for us to use all our arguments during the talks, recalling that we are a country through which most of the gas flows," said Ukrainian Economic Minister Anatoly Kinkh to the Reuters press agency.
"The fluctuations in gas costs would probably be linked to our discussions about transit taxes (to Western Europe) via Ukraine"
The last major altercation between Moscow and Kiev caused in January 2006, the interruption of Gazprom's supplies for Ukraine.
This has led to a fall in exports to Western Europe, resulting in an increase in prices.
Russian gas accounts for one quarter of the European Union's supplies.
Russia has the largest gas stocks, even though most of them are still under development.
Consequently, Gazprom completes its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other nations of the former Soviet Union in Central Asia.
The Ministry of Health 'must control its foreign employees'.
The Scottish Ministry of Health needs to improve the controls on its extra-Community employees to check if they have previous penalties, said the Monitoring Committee.
The General Rev. Robert Black's warning came after a foreign doctor working in Scotland was involved in the attack at Glasgow airport in June.
Mr. Black also expressed concern that the Scottish Ministry of Health did not have any specific data on the number of overseas persons employed by the Ministry of Health.
Its report also highlighted other decisive controls, properly carried out on a sample of employees from five health authorities.
The Auditor General carried out checks on extra-Community personnel following the attack at Glasgow airport.
Bilal Addullah, 28 years old, a doctor of Iraqi origin at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after darkening with his jeep, in the doors of the main terminal.
He was one of the three doctors who were filmed at Old Bailey in October, as they were suspected of being involved in various car explosion attempts in the United Kingdom.
The Ministry of Health will have to carry out pre-employment checks on overseas staff, to be some of the validity of their qualifications, experiences, and work permits for the United Kingdom.
Although the Scottish Ministry of Health uses the Scottish Disclosure to carry out previous criminal checks, the Agency has no right to obtain such information outside Great Britain.
Among the numerous warnings, the reviewer-general's report now states that committees are required to confront the Office of the Supervision of criminal precedents, thus enabling employers to undertake controls on various countries.
"Although we have discovered that certain staff information has been verified, it is not done at all."
Mr. Black said that the Ministry of Health of Scotland carried out most of the pre-employment checks it would carry out, but he added: "Our report highlights aspects where the system can be improved to ensure that adequate information on some overseas personnel is available to health services.
Mr. Peter Terry, President of BMA Scotland said it was "extremely unlikely" that pre-employment controls could identify employees who could commit future terrorist acts.
He stated that "the report suggests that the pre-employment checks currently carried out, work well in the Scottish health system and that it is not certain that these warnings can bring some added value."
The Scottish health authorities stated that 1161 overseas persons were employed by most doctors and nurses.
However, the General Reviewer stressed that these figures must certainly be revised further, partly because of problems with the identification of staff with indeterminate duration contracts, which may or may not choose to remain in our country.
The investigation has shown that the current procedures for monitoring health authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanrkshire, and Lothian are perfectly adequate.
These checks are carried out on passports, work permits and qualifications.
The Government of Scotland is currently reviewing its policy and its system of pre-employment controls for non-Ocean staff in the health service.
Secretary to Health Nicola Sturgeon said: "I was enthusiastic about doing this work following the terrorist attack at Glasgow airport."
She added that the Government of Scotland associated with the health committees would carefully consider the warnings set out in the report that should be published next month, and would undertake to ensure better implementation of the recently updated pre-employment controls, and valid for all employees, including overseas persons.

Saudi Arabia Block 208 Terrifying Plots
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it had arrested 208 militants involved in organizing cells that were carrying out an imminent attack on an oil site, as well as attacks against the clergy and the armed forces.
The state television of the world's largest oil exporter stated that one of the missile smuggling cells.
Al Qaeda supporters have staged a campaign against allied monarchy in the United States since 2003, following Iraq's invasion.
A cell composed of eight militants, led by a foreign resident, planned an attack on an oil site in the Eastern Province, reported the TV newspaper.
Saudi Arabia quickly formed a group of 35,000 troops to protect the sites, following a failed attack by Al Qaeda in 2006, against the largest oil site in Abqaiq.
The newspaper citing a statement by the Minister of the Interior said that 18 of the arrested persons belong to a cell headed by a "missile launch expert" who infiltrated the country.
It is said that militants planned the counterband of eight missiles in the kingdom.
22 persons among the detainees appear to have plotted the murder of ecclesiastics and armed forces.
The government called on churchmen to do more against Saudis led in Iraq, to join Al Qaeda militants fighting the Allied Forces and the Allied Muslim Shiite government in the United States, considered heretical according to Saudi Sunny's hard line.
Al Qaeda activists believe that in Saudi Arabia, many ecclesiastics have collaborated with the authorities to support the policy of the royal family that dominates the government.
The militants, encouraged by calls against the pro-Western Saudi government, by Osama Bin Laden, leader of Al Qaeda of Saudi origin, targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy supply sites.
Major efforts have been made by the armed forces during these five... last months" said the Minister of the Interior spokesperson for state television.
Among the detainees, there are 16 members of the Médine organized into a "media cell" to promote "Takfiri thought", the ideology of the Sunni Muslim radicals that supports the use of violence against unfaithful and apostate Muslims.
Among the detainees, 32 persons are accused of subsidizing militants.
The climate of Venus could reveal the future of the Earth.
The scientists said yesterday that Venus was certainly a pleasant planet to live.
The data from the European orbit ship showed that the planet is certainly twice as small as the Earth, contrary to what was previously thought.
Venus is the closest planet on Earth.
These two worlds are practically the same size, with similar orbits, although Venus is closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, Venus could have had conditions similar to those on Earth, and could have even been habitable.
But the greenhouse effect due to carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion due to solar radiation combined with slower rotation led Venus to another kind of evolution.
Today the planet is waterless, ravaged by hurricanes and lightning storms and has a temperature surface warm enough to melt lead.
The discoveries of Venus Express, the probe of the European Space Agency, which has studied the planet for a year, offer a sad vision of Earth's potential future due to catastrophic climate changes.
Professor of Physics at the University of Oxford, Fred Taylor, one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: "we begin to understand why the climate of Venus is so different from that of the Earth, although the planets themselves are practically similar.
"Our new data allows us to establish a scenario where billions of years ago, Venus would have been originally identical to Earth, may even be with a living area."
Of uranium enriched by the police.
One kilo of radioactive material, apparently uranium, was kidnapped by the Czechoslovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
One police officer stated that three persons were arrested and that the equipment is currently being analysed.
He did not confirm that it was a good uranium, but found that the goods would have a value of $1 million ($480,000).
Still open to everything
Mitt Romney said he wasn't up to being a presidential candidate to answer the questions of a snowman.
Despite this, the Republican presidential candidates finally agreed to participate in the You Tube debate, during which many ordinary voters registered their questions, submit them to the candidates.
On Wednesday evening, November 28, none of the questions raised were as ridiculous as that of another debate in You Tube, when a snowman asked the Democrats for their position in relation to global warming.
But this time, questions and answers have reflected much on the conditions of the Republican party, candidate for the next elections.
It is not known which criteria the CNN producers, who sponsored the debate, chose the clips of You Tube to show the applicants.
But the first half hour of the debate, the longest one-on-one theme, focused on immigration.
The subject is one of the strong subjects for the Republicans.
CNN asked some voters to call when they would hear funny things: The government noted increases in approval when candidates expressed in a gross manner.
The toughest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, leader of the national front, and Mr. Romney, who is in charge of the important early elections of Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani tried to highlight the fact that he was accommodating about illegal immigration during his term as mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts, of employing illegal immigrants at his home.
The two fighters became particularly fierce when asked whether they would be willing to promote an "amnesia" (providing clandestine status and the possibility of becoming a citizen).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a Californian congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, have been able to deepen this subject.
Neither of them has the opportunity to be elected, but both remain in the race, may be due to the fact that they have begun to fight immigration before and in a more incisive way than the others.
In general, candidates, at least regarding immigration, have the same views: stricter borders, and zero tolerance for illegal immigrants.
This subject, coupled with concerns raised in particular by the issue of toxic toys manufactured in China, or other fears of the external world, encourages Republicans to forget, or minimize divisions between libertarians and Catholic conservatives.
But the debate has become particularly embarrassing when other subjects have been raised.
Mr. Giuliani asked why he had previously supported the arms control campaign.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether to put water into the nose should be considered torture.
One of the speakers asked if the candidates believed in the Bible as a whole.
This led Mr. Giuliani to dare declare that the Bible is his favorite book, even though it is not about to believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another speaker asked whether Jesus would have been in favour of the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee was not expected to be placed in Iowa in a recent election, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism, to declare that the death penalty is painful though necessary.
When we insisted on whether Jesus would have been in favor, he laughed and said that Jesus was too chic to present himself to the elections.
The human race remains unusually open to everything.
Mr. Huckabee's return to Iowa coincides with the recent prodigious research into grants conducted by libertarian Ron Paul and the whistles during the Wednesday debate.
These two emerged from the negant, thanks to the fact that the two protected by the party do not come to agree to decide who is the most known and most traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate unified the party of good time and convincingly with a message of success on the American greatness thus bringing the leaders closer together.
This time, the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
The pains of the Workers
Gordon Brown discovered a new hole in which to shade; even if he resigned, the situation would not change.
Given the tendency of British scandals, it is not particularly juicy.
No decorations sold, no Parisian hotel invoices from politicians, no extra-conjugal toe successful.
But here's what a revelation attests that a rich businessman would have masked for four years, under false names, his contributions to the present Labour Party, equivalent to more than £650,000 ($1.3m), that the party would not have declared: A new battle that Gordon Brown had successfully fought.
Two months ago, the Prime Minister stepped back in his draft election, insulting the British intelligence stupidly proclaiming that the opinion polls did not influence his decision, and that he hoped, on the contrary, to offer a compact and effective government.
On the contrary, such Vince Cable, the brilliant Liberal Democratic leader, stated that the terrifying Mr. Brown has turned from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The purchase of Northern Rock, a bank in difficulty on board the crack, demonstrated a failure of the guidelines and a poor judgment in the event of an emergency.
Inadequate proposals to change the tax code have led to a coalition of industrial groups against the government.
The loss of 25 million personal data by tax authorities revealed an incredible administrative stock.
A trio of retired generals launched a revolt among the Lords, a Protestant against cuts in military spending: they proclaimed that being a defence minister is for them, a part-time job.
At present, the suspicion of crazy donations by David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Secretary General of Laborists (and his former head of vigilance) caused them to resign.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is going unrelentingly towards the exit.
However, governments can reach a point where it would be impossible to govern.
People don't like politicians, and they don't trust them, but they generally leave their doubts aside when a new government comes to power.
It seems obvious that a prime minister cannot improve things, or even rule for a long time, when he is at risk of suspension: public administration no longer works; ministers' offices check; the press is looking for bad stories; and the government is becoming defensive and with no further purpose.
In a sense, Mr Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, he cannot boast of being a beginner.
Although he would like to reject Tony Blair, he was still his senior lieutenant.
The problems related to Northern Rock and tax data, for example, are related to Mr. Brown's decisions when he was Chancellor of the British Treasury.
And even if he is not directly involved in Blair's woes, such as the long investigation into the funds of the "money party counting on members of the House of Lords", voters might think otherwise.
But the difficult situation that Mr. Brown is facing is not so tragic that she seems to be.
The gaffs are not as monstrous as the members of the Tories Party make him believe.
As in Mr. Bean, there are no victims or scams.
And the remedy, although painful, could be to make Mr Brown's usual Stalinist tendencies concrete, in favour of a reliable and slightly brutal government.
The new political donation scandal is a good example.
Abrahams, a very special character, who compared his donations to charity, said he did not wish any public recognition of his charity.
He may have his opinion, but it is not up to him to decide.
The laws against the anonymity of the great grantors of politicians are clear, and they exist for good reason: The public has the right to know who contributes to the success of those who will govern the country.
Mr. Watt, who said he was aware of Mr. Abrahams' programs, not knowing that it was illegal, should therefore be questioned, as did Jon Mendlesohn, the fundraising manager who had spoken of the uncertain donations in October.
But so far Mr. Brown is not involved: Nothing suggests that he was aware of these steps, even though most payments were made following his arrival in the government in June.
So far the Prime Minister has made half.
He quickly condemned his party's legislative flaw, but did not draw attention to the fact that decision-making power is based on something he knows well, using an inquiry committee on this matter consisting of a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons to be learned are not complicated.
And if the law has been violated, it's the police's responsibility.
In addition, there are many other things that Mr. Brown has to do, such as finding a permanent chair for the independent Committee on Standards of Public Life, without a leader for six months, and preparing for a good reform on the financing of political parties.
This would force the Labour Party, in a moment of weakness, to collaborate with the Tories, which could lead it to renounce its special financial relationship with the confederations; in short, a bitter pill for such a partisan Mr. Brown.
But he should face certain partisan facts.
The Conservative party now has a good advantage for elections; it is two years old to win voters again, and the only way to win a victory is to demonstrate irreprehensible integrity and solid skills.
Card scams.
Would the mortgage crisis contaminate the U.S. credit card market?
When there's blood in the water, it's normal to see pointed fins, whirl around.
Now that the U.S. real estate market is going through a critical phase, predators are targeting the U.S. credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts believe that credit card losses could reach $99 billion if the contagion extends from mortgages to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in fees and insolvency rates, which measures the unrecoverable or non-recoverable balance sheet shares, more than 30 days later.
HSBC announced last month that it took $1.4 billion in its consumer credits, partly because of the weakness of card carriers.
It's too early to panic.
Costs and insolvencys are still moderate.
According to Moody, a tax agency, the insolvency rate of 3.89% of the third quarter is nearly one point lower than its historical average.
The deterioration of rates is partly explained by technical factors.
A change in laws in the United States in 2005 on the personal bankroad caused a sudden fall in the archives of the bankroad, which in turn caused serious losses for credit cards; the number of archives (and thus insolvency rates) could increase even if borrowing conditions were to worsen.
The industry also announces fixed payment rates, which highlight the monthly amount of debt that consumers have to pay.
and confidence in the security of credit card capital is quite strong despite the paralysis of other aspects of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney from TowerGroup, a research company, predicted that the show volume for 2007 would be 25% higher than last year.
Direct links between the mortgage crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers may prefer to increase their debts now that equitable real estate loans have disappeared.
But card issuers pay more attention to the flow of species than to the value of the heritage, and so the fall in real estate prices did not necessarily lead to a change in the credibility of borrowers.
They could even bring benefits to issuers of credit securities.
Consumer premiums for mortgage payments fall if the properties cost less than the value of the loan; thus, credit card debt would become a priority to repair the whole.
Card issuers are able to respond much faster than mortgages and with more flexibility to such crisis conditions because they can change interest rates or alter credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of rapid recovery.
"We're not going to wake up one morning and reassess all loans." said Gary Perlin, Capital One's director.
If a financial disaster in the credit card market is unlikely, there is a high risk of a significant decline.
If lower real estate prices and a contraction in the credit market lead America to the recession, the industry will certainly face a macabre future.
Be careful with the dorsal fins..
British bankers plead guilty for the Enron case.
The three British bankers who were supposed to testify to fraud committed by Enron's previous financial director, Andrew Fastow, changed their statement, pleading guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew first declared themselves innocent of the seven charges for alleged collusory fraud in 2000, committed by Fastow in a secret financial scam to enrich themselves despite their employees.
They are expected to appear in court in January.
But during a hearing chaired by U.S. Justice Ewing Werlein Jr, they all found themselves guilty of fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a subsidiary of the PLC Group of the Royal Bank of Scotland, became famous throughout Britain because of extradition procedures that lasted two years.
In the United States, their case remains a pending issue for this investigation launched following the fall of Enron in 2001.
The charges imposed on them in 2002 revealed to Fastow that he was the subject of the government's investigation into the Enron Dam.
The allegations against bankers, nicknamed the "Third of Natwest" claim to have come to Houston in 2000, to organize a fraudulent scenario with Fastow and his former right arm, Michael Kopper.
NatWest Greenwich invested in a subsidiary of an Enron partner controlled by Fastow, who was the director of many fraudulent scenarios, who helped him cheat the bankruptcy proceedings.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had estimated its interest in the subsidiary as null, but in fact the three British already know its value.
A company controlled by Kopper purchased the interest of the subsidiary bank for £1 million.
Bankers paid $250,000 to Kopper as an interest for this company.
According to the accusation, Fastow would have falsely announced to Enron that the energy company was willing to pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But actually these $20 million went into the pockets of the British bankers, Fastow and others.
According to the charges, bankers would have earned $7.3 while Fastow, Kopper and the others would have earned $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty for his active role in two conspiracys in the Enron Debacle.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow endures a six-year incarceration in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is incarcerated for 3 years and a month in a prison in Texarkana.
The three British were released following the payment of a $1 million bond each, forcing them to live in the United States during the trial.
Enron, formerly the seventh largest national company, on the highway in December 2001, after years of accounting tricks, could no longer hide its billions of debt nor even propose its speculative bidon as profitable.
The collapse caused thousands of redundancies, more than $60 billion lost market value and more than $2 billion lost for retirement plans.
The founder of Enron, Kenneth Lay and former President General Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their involvement in the collapse of society.
Skilling was sentenced to more than 24 years in prison.
The charges against Lay for conspiracy, fraud and other crimes were futile due to his death due to a heart attack last year.
No sauce or outside of Moscow.
The cost of a G550 Gulfstream aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and having sufficient fuel autonomy to fly from Moscow to Los Angeles without a stop, starts at $54 million.
But this is only a small change for some Russians.
"He can transport up to 18 passengers," said Dan Fier, a representative of Gulfstream.
"Even if no one really needs so many seats since it is more than a family-use aircraft or for the president of a company."
Mr. Fier was present at the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the Millionaires Exhibition, an orgy of consumer incentives, for four days, held in a huge exhibition centre around the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other exhibitors were present with their stands, hoping to attract the interest of the new rich Russians for their varied products, ranging from yachts in acajou to cars filled with diamonds like those of 50 cent.
Mr. Fier was scrutinising a bright orange Porsche, exposed next to his stand.
"It's a nice car, but nothing comparable to our product," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest private aircraft market."
"With an oil boom, the Russian capital seems to be rolling in black gold, such as Dallas"
"We experienced the same thing in the 1890s, when some Americans became so rich and landed in Europe where they were considered materialists," said Marshall Goldman, a senior scholar of the Davis department of Russian and Eurasian studies at Harvard University."
Such Saudis in the 1970s, Japanese in the 1990s, Russians emerged as the largest world spending.
The biggest luxury brands are looking for their place in the Klondike.
This week, in another place in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry enabled Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, President of LVMH, to exchange their ideas on the strategy to be followed for the sale of luxury goods in markets such as Russia.
(The conference was organized by the International Herald Tribune, which belongs to The New York Times.)
Russia has 53 billion worth $282 billion, according to the Forbes list listing the richest people.
In addition, two thirds of the rich are made up of 103,000 Russian millionaires worth $670 billion overall, according to a study on the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, carried out by economists of the Economic and Financial Research Centre.
(the World Bank stated that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians lived below the poverty line).
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow, that's why we're all there," said Nicole Marais, a representative of Davis Morris, a London jeweler.
She participated in the exhibition for the first time in the company of the Russian distributor, Le Grupo Bijoutier de Soho.
“All women are well prepared and men are worth a fortune.”
Walking in the living room, Sunday night, the two real estate agents placed on their 31, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26 declare themselves to be their clients, millionaires.
"I looked at the cars and tried to choose between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Melle Yumatova, who seized her high-couture dress such as a red carpet veteran like Joan Rivers.
The living room seems above all to target the new rich, the kind of buyers of Russian brands willing to do the tail in the caps to come up to a huge warehouse where they are exposed to Cadillac Escalades, platinum cans, Mövenpick ice creams, personalized pool tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund teddy bear.
The public could buy the tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
"the Russians are interested in defining the most expensive and the best brands," said Mr. Gijrath, proudly sitting at the Royal factory stand for the manufacture of Dutch porcelain Delf, in front of a wall painting of Raimbrant on blue tiles, hand-made.
"It is certain that the Russians are more interested in blinging bling"
In fact, the sellers here stated that Russians with old capital (10 to 15 years are too much according to Russian standards) have already passed shining logos to some sort of limited edition brand that could not be sold at the salon.
Despite this, thousands of people, either millionaires, millionaires or tourists, hang the exhibition every day.
And some even buy.
On the first night of the exhibition, last Thursday, Roman Ershow, the CEO of the King Koil beds, said he sold two sets of silk mattresses, cashmere, and cotton inlaid with golden threads.
During the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, the sales director of A1 moto, a company that equips cars with last scream alarm systems, also stated that he sold to a Russian millionaire, the shiny orange Porsche, for $170,000.
By Sunday after noon, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, a company that personalizes luxury cars, said he would sell three cars similar to bracelets, for Rolls-Royce Phantoms, at $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter, the wheel of a car designed for the owner of a Russian casino, who wanted her to be embedded in Swarovski crystals to look like a wheel wheel.
The set of four costs $22,000.
"The Russian millionaire who wants wheels made of ostrich leather, or a picture of his wife made of cubic zirconium, will not necessarily drive with such tires," said Mr. Karapetian.
It will certainly keep it in its garage containing already 30 or 40 vehicles »
Although many of his Russian clients are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the term "Russian millionaire" is not on the agenda, given the increase in real estate prices here.
"if you had bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you would already be millionaire, at least on paper, if not in kind," he said.
"there are more that you might think about"
Those who are not millionaires may at least feel this emotion when they go to the booth of Alliance Continental, a Russian heritage management company.
The company has set up four booths representing British telephone booths, filled with cash of counterfeiting dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing director, said his team printed 500,000 false tickets for the Millionaire fair.
Passers arrested to launch mass of tickets, ask their friends to photograph them on their mobile, in the beautiful middle of this fake wealth or imposing a few million.
"You see, here in Moscow, everybody can feel millionaire," said Mr. Karyev.
Surgeon not approved suspected homicide in New Jersey
It was Thanksgiving's eve when Ronald Livingston looked through the window bay of Just a little Healthier restaurant and observed an ambulance that had just stopped at the doors of the White Cape Cod on West Scott Avenue.
Then comes the police patrol.
And then another one.
"Then I saw the medical vehicle stop," said Mr. Livingston, a restaurant manager, on Wednesday.
That's where I realized someone died.
The authorities would then learn that the deceased was a 41-year-old woman, Olga Arroyo, assistant director of the Newark Police Department.
Now the investigators are trying to determine whether the cause of his death is due to a gesture performed by an unapproved cosmetic surgeon, that the police have not yet identified, residing at 212 West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have not yet determined the causes of Miss Arroyo's death, but they are waiting for confidence, the results of the toxicological tests that will take some time, but which should enable to resolve this mysterious death that has troubled the high ranks of Newark's police.
Ms. Arroyo was the assistant of the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was well known in various departments.
She was loyal, great worker and tenacious," Mr. McCarthy said about Ms. Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday."
"she was like a pit bull"
"she would have done everything to protect me"
Mr. McCarthy stated that Ms. Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who worked for the Alcohol Control Commission, and that she left two 14-11-year-old sons and a daughter-in-law.
Eileen Walsj, spokesperson for Union County prosecutor Theodore J. Romankow, said the detectives were trying to determine whether Miss Arroyo died because of an unauthorized surgical operation.
"It is an opportunity to consider."
"the investigation continues."
The authorities said they had arrived at her place around 3 p.m.
and found Miss Roryo on the couch.
She was declared dead.
A little over a week has passed since, and the authorities have not said much about the investigation nor even about the owner of the house identified as Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms. Walsh was unable to confirm whether Ms. Castro was questioned by the authorities.
Investigators seek to understand whether part of the house was used as a medical firm.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door of Melle Castro where a sparkled rose was lying in the closet of the cemetery in front, and a Dalmatian barked at the back.
A blue bottle called "Ethyl Vanillin" used as a substitute for vanilla in the kitchen and for perfumes, lay in a hangar, next to a door that leads to the ground.
Two bikes all land hanged on the sides.
McCarthy stated that since her arrival in Newark 25 years ago, in the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo has been extremely valuable, helping her to navigate the new city and abandon her framed political culture.
"She said, "You must be careful about this," he said.
"She was there when I arrived, and still when I was leaving.
"It was embarrassing"
Everyone hopes that the Federal Reserve will reduce rates related to the effervescence of the world stock exchange.
The shares exploded on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after the market hoped that the Federal Reserve would have tried to calm the conditions of the credit, later reducing the interest rates promoted by the calming statements of the Vice President of the Central American Bank.
The stock markets explode in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, 2 after Ben Bernanke, President of the Federal Reserve, said that those who decide must be "flexible and pragmatic" in their actions in the financial markets.
In an obvious effort to reassure irritable markets in view of these new credit-related tensions, Mr. Kohn said that the recent turbulence has partly "reversed certain improvements in the functioning of the market at the end of September and October.
If this harsh turbulence were to persist, it would increase the likelihood of a later rigidity of financial conditions for owners and businesses, he said.
These comments appear to investors as an obvious signal that the Federal Reserve is ready to inject new capital into the US markets, and that further decreases in interest rates could stabilize credit conditions.
These observations also calmed Wall Street with even worse news on the American economy, such as the largest decrease in real estate sales for October.
The impact of this financial turmoil has been accentuated following the statement by Bear Stearns, an investment bank, that it will fire 650 people, i.e. 4% of its staff, to reduce costs to compensate for heavy losses due to loss of real estate loans.
Only 20 posts are planned in London where the bank employs 1500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average increased by 331 points, or 2.55% to 13,289,40 while the largest index, S&P 500, took 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index took 165.5 points or 2.7% to 6306.2 adding more than 39 pounds to the value of British companies.
The German Dax index increased by 2.6% and the French CAC40 took 2.3%.
In the past, the recurrence of credit difficulties in markets has been highlighted as a result of the high demand for a sale of three-monthly auctions from the European Central Bank, which has cut these loans to European commercial banks at a high rate of 4.7%, the highest since April 2001.
The pressures on the Bank of England to follow the EDF and the ECB and inject further funds into London's financial markets causing credit tensions have caused the British banks to increase their highest monthly interest rates since September, at 6.59% following a high rise since November 12.
England faces an appeal for judgment against the critics of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara.
We are facing two dilemmas, one as difficult as the other.
Who will be drummer number 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And even more important in a context as wide as the first Test against Sri Lanka, which will make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the chairman of the selection officers who was there exceptionally to help Peter Moores, the coach leader, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, make his decision, and because Hugh Morris' office, the CEO of England, begins to fill out the application forms to become a national selector, at least part-time.
The one who won't win the 6th file will be bad, but life is often unfair and sport is too.
It is never easy to erase what allows a man to reach the top of his profession while another will never reach the bottom level, sometimes due to lack of luck more than due to lack of ability.
It is not only in cricket that selection is difficult, because in the end, the judgment remains subjective.
Is it the right time to make Bopara emerge?
Is that just about Shah?
The same could be proposed in another context, which chooses between John Edwards or Banerjee "tube"?; both new executives having obtained good degrees, professionals, should be promoted: but there is only room for one of them.
Who has the right to determine the right level of a cricket unless given at least one chance?
Figures are important in decisions, but also opportunities.
Inside a team, a cricket must capture the captain's eye, at the same time he must take the door and a drummer must be lucky to touch the cricket of one day.
But capturing the eyes of the selectors is much more complicated.
Many have done better last season, for example, James Anderson who seemed certain to play the first test, even though Stephen Harmison was speaking in full form and continued to train to serve.
Anderson took 32 first-class doors on 33 laps to win a seat.
Chris Tremlett only took 29 at the same average, but both have already experienced their moment of glory at the highest level and hope to offer again.
If it's Shah or Bopara who's gonna play at Asgiriya Stadium, it's just a matter of opinion.
This choice could erase or build a man's career, but it makes little difference.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played every test and was successful in the first, with five doors and 40 useful laps, but it was Paul Collingwood, who was also struggling to emerge, who succeeded in becoming the primary cricketer of the Test, and this, despite the fact that his double cent against Australia in Australia could still be underestimated.
The probability is that Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores, following another discussion after today's session at Asgiriya Stadium, will certainly follow their conservative instincts and promote Shah's greatest experience against the exuberance of the young Bopara.
Both have good arguments.
In favour of Shah, his brilliant and considerable beginning at the Innings of the Test of 88 in Bombay, 32 cents first class versus six for Bopara, who is 22 years younger, and his excellent ranking at launch.
But Shah did only ten laps during his two innings in May against the Caribbean during the Test in Lord, his Middlesex player city, and that, the immediate rejection by the pickers when Vaughan again in shape, claims his place for the next match, seems to have afflicted his momentum so obvious in Bombay.
Unlike him, Essex's player is full of joy to live.
Nothing frightens him on a cricket field and he exaggerated when he recently landed on a 4x4 during a presentation by Volkswagen, sponsor of England.
He only delayed minor injuries, was shocked, even though the first thing he did was to take his Vodafone (sponsor quite well on) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who looked at him from afar, to ask him if "he had seen this?"
Bopara is by far the best drummer, its glitter allows him to perform services that go for him, and that he beats with confidence and professionalism.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Could it be the true art of selection?
I would be inclined to give Bopara his chance, which does not mean that Shah should not apply if, as the tea leaves suggest, he will be the one who will play this weekend.
Buses bring people to work, and fight al Qaeda.
The first bus full of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, pouring out these exiles without money or visa renewals, or others who hope that the city has regained normality.
Some have returned to fight the militants who have taken them away from their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of Damascus of 800 people transported in convoys of dozens of buses from the official government, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who returned by their means.
"I decided to go to Syria after they killed several doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Dr. Sunni.
"I came back today because I saw on TV and read in the newspapers what happened in Baghdad and saw that the city is safer now."
"They say the Mahdi army is no longer committing crimes!" he said, referring to the Shia militia of the Church militant Moqtada al-Sadr, who has forced his men to stay away for the time being.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher in the Amariyah area dominated by the Sunni, returned with his two children, because he could no longer renew his Syrian visa and because the regime prevented the Iraqis from working.
His neighbours from Shia to Amariyah called him to inform him that the U.S.-aided militia allowed him to hunt Al Qaeda from the west of the capital, and invited him home.
One of Jordan's new arrivals is the leader of a Sunni and Shia tribe who had to leave his home in northern Baghdad because of a grenade attack after he urged citizens to rebel against Al-Qaeda.
But he had to come home to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me they had set up an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh, and they needed me and my boys."
"That's why I'm back today," said 62-year-old Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
Many say that they have attracted the increasing calm of the capital since the American troops arrived, and in view of the continuing formation of "groups of citizens involved" well armed and collaborating with the US military to defend their neighbourhood.
But still others say they were forced to return because of the visa problem and the decline of the capital of Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis fled in the past years.
Salaam al-Samarai, 51, father of three children, expressed the suspicion that everyone felt about visas for exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, Prime Minister Shia, would have asked the Syrian government to limit the number of people returning to the country.
More than two and a half million people reportedly fled the country because of sectarian squadrons of death.
"We didn't have a problem until al-Maliki came to Syria and encouraged the government to stop giving visas to the Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq," said retired Sunni.
"I cannot trust a government that supports criminals who burned down my house when I left."
The decrease in violence can be partly explained by the fact that the Sunnis have been driven from the Shia and vice versa areas, creating places where tensions are less.
It is feared that a sudden flow of refugees will not again increase sectarian tensions and bring back fighting.
Little Sarre, good training.
The smallest federated state is leading in vocational training, and even shines from the international orientation of its higher schools.
It is only in one area that there is a deficit on the Sarrois, similar to that of the rest of the country.
"I explained yesterday for the 50th time to a non-Sarrois, that we are not French" - it is the slogan that the smallest federated state, by itself, displays for its 50th anniversary.
At this level, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the training system of Sarre, which is placed fifth in the training monitor of the German Institute of Economy of Cologne.
Thus, already by tradition, higher schools cooperate closely with neighbouring countries.
The university was founded in Sarrebruck in 1948 by the French.
To date, students have the opportunity to complete their studies with a double or even a triple degree.
This is evidenced by the high rate of 15.6 per cent of foreign students.
The Sarre also leads the country's children to higher schools in higher numbers than the average - many of them without a Gymnasium degree.
"In Sarre, we take advantage of the vocational training system," says Axel Plünnecke, an IW training expert.
More than one in five young people get their degree in a vocational school, so the Sarre is more than seven points above the national average.
Also the possibilities for combining vocational and academic training are relatively well developed.
In view of the number of inhabitants, the double course panel is the second best in Germany.
In spite of practical training and increasing demand, however, the number of engineering graduates has declined by one third in recent years.
This is why the Ministry of Sarrois Education has forced higher schools to a marketing campaign in engineering science.
"After the first PISA studies, we celebrated a large number of reforms in general schools," said a spokesperson from the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government has introduced comparisons tests throughout the federated state.
For children to begin early learning, the last year of daycare is free of law - a model that in the meantime other federated states also copy.
Only future comparison studies will show whether students' performances are improving in a sustainable way.
In the PISA studies in 2003, the percentage of students at risk decreased from 29 to 20 percent.
In total, however, the Sarre has not improved as much as other federated states.
Bavarians are getting better.
And in spite of sarrois, knowledge in foreign languages is not measured by PISA studies - it could otherwise be gained points in this field.
Because the neighbor's language is mandatory in high schools - even if the sarrois are not French.
Click to set the watches
In Venezuela, watches will soon be ticking differently than in the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chavez will bring back the half-hour timer in the South American country.
Chavez in the meantime becomes a cartoon in Spain.
As the official newspaper of Venezuela communicated it, as a result of a new law, watches will be set at less than four and a half hours from universal time.
In this way, the South American country obtains a time zone that does not exist in any other state of the world.
Anti-American Chávez justified his position, among other things, by the fact that the United States would have imposed on the world the separation of time zones in full hours.
In addition, Chávez announced on Wednesday (local time) the cessation of relations with the neighbouring country, Colombia, due to a hostage case.
The left nationalist announced that as long as Conservative Alvaro Uribe remained president of Colombia, he would not maintain relations with the head of state or with the Colombian government.
"I can't do it just because of my dignity," said Chávez, who is looking forward to constitutional reform on which the citizens of the oil country will have to vote by referendum on Sunday.
With this reform, it would significantly strengthen its power in the country.
The starting point for this dispute was the decision of Uribe to withdraw Chávez's mandate to negotiate the release of hostages with Marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe would have "cracked the face" of Venezuela with this decision, had criticized Sunday Chávez.
In Spain too Chávez is in all the mouths.
A new mobile phone ringing rages in the country: "Why don't you shut up" (why don't you do that) is the phrase that already over half a million people have downloaded on the Internet.
It was spoken by the king of Spain Juan Carlos, who, at the latest Ibero-American summit, was irritated by the constant inquiries of the left-wing populists and who told him to shut up.
Lower wages threaten Germany in 2007.
Despite the strong conjuncture, according to one prediction, a real lower wage rate threatens German employees this year.
Experts have cited all sorts of reasons to explain their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation of the Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees are expected to expect a real decrease in their pay form in 2007 compared with the previous year.
"The fault is due to low wage development, increased value added tax and increased food and energy prices," said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Research on the Environment in the "Bild" newspaper.
New charges could also be applied to unemployment insurance for the employee.
The Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück told the newspaper "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the expected fall in unemployment insurance by 3.3 per cent for the new year was correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the National Employment Agency no longer has the right to be embarrassed to ask the Federation for credits or financial assistance, in the words of the SPD politician.
It was reported on Tuesday that the explosion of food and hydrocarbon prices had increased the inflation rate at its highest level for 13 years.
In total, prices increased by 3.0 percent from year to year.
Venus is Earth's infernal twin.
Despite its hostile atmosphere to life, Venus looks more like the Earth than we thought so far: the European Space Survey "Venus Express" has discovered lightnings in the atmosphere and windstorms at poles, similar to those appearing in winter on Earth.
For nearly three decades, scientists have assumed that there are flashes on Venus.
The European probe "Venus Express" today has proved it - it has detected electromagnetic waves at the limit of the atmosphere: the lights on Venus burst at about 56 km of cloud in the cloud, reports Christopher Russell of the University of California in Los Angeles in the scientific magazine "Nature".
According to the famous Cyprine theory, lightning would have revealed life on Earth: storm would have stimulated reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, a cornerstone of life.
This is not the case on Venus: "If life has been there, it must have been on a very ancient date of history," explains Sean Solomon of the "Carnegie Institution" in Washington.
There should be little living things on the surface of Venus today: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, sometimes there are temperatures of 500 degrees.
"Venus is perhaps Earth's infernal twin, but she remains a twin," said Russel.
Why Venus, which looks so much like the Earth in mass and dimensions, was struck by such a different evolution, is the fundamental question of the ESA mission.
The departure of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was an important step in Venezuela's research, since no more probes were on the way to exploring this planet since the 1980s.
In the opinion of the researchers, the most recent research results that have now been presented in several "Nature" articles do not only highlight the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
They also show that the common points with the Earth of our neighbouring planet are more than supposed in the first place.
Thus the researchers found, in addition to the wind turbines already known at the north pole, a cloud whirlpool at the south pole, which rotates even faster.
The phenomenon recalls air currents in the terrestrial hemispheres in winter, writes a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni of the Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Physica Cosmica Italian.
The second planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the Earth and is, with a diameter of 12,100 kilometres, almost as large.
The planet qualified as a star in the evening or in the morning revolves around the sun in just 225 days.
However, it turns much slower on itself: a Venezuelan day lasts 243 days.
Although Venus, with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, hardly recalls the Earth, scientists assume that both planets have formed themselves under similar conditions.
On both sides, the water accumulated and remained on Earth in the form of oceans, but lost in the space on Venus.
And while carbon dioxide has been fixed on Earth as carbonate, it constitutes on Venus most of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama.
The President of the Federal Republic of Germany Köhler demands the end of the party dispute about the Dalai Lama's reception to Chancellery.
Indirectly, he criticized the SPDs due to attacks on the chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about the appearance of Germany and sums up the great coalition to close the dispute over the Dalai Lama's reception.
"We must not present a divided nation to the outside world on this issue," said Köhler at Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler demonstrated understanding for the reception of Dalai Lama by chancellaire Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights have universal validity, even though I have respect for differences between cultures," said Köhler.
Everyone knows that Germany should maintain a significant balance in foreign policy, stressed the President of the Federal Republic, but defended Merkel against the complaints that it would organize a new policy of China.
The German chancellor has not distanced herself from the traditional policy of just one China.
"China knows that too," said Köhler.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs Frank-Walter Steimeier (SPD) had indirectly expressed his dissatisfaction with the Dalai Lama's reception and had been attacked for this outside of the CDU's ranks.
Steinmeier complained, in particular, of the CDU's "policy of the front" on foreign policy.
After Dalai Lama's reception at Chancellery, virulent irritations were felt in German-Chinese relations.
Thus, the Chinese government not only commissioned the German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD) but also, according to Spiegel's information, frozen the so-called foreign ministers' strategy dialogue.
China's head of government Wen Jiabao now requires German chancellor Angela Merkel to recognize that the Dalai-Lama was a mistake.
China refused to allow European politicians to receive the spiritual leader of Tibet in its official functions, supported Wen Jiabao thus the Chinese position.
The Dalai Lama's words and deeds would show that he was trying to separate Tibet from China and other Tibetan regions, including other current provinces.
Schäuble warns against riots like those of France.
Street fights with police, shootings, fire cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against riots like those of France.
Everything must be implemented so that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not break out in the streets by violence, demanded the German Minister of the Interior.
The German Minister of the Interior Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) created similar developments in Germany.
We need to ensure that a social explosive does not also become a part of our home and is demolished in violence.
We need to take this seriously," he said at the New Press published in Hanover.
Not all young people would be able to cope with the rapid transformations of social reality.
The Federation, the federated States and the municipalities were already working hard to reduce the problems, Schäuble said.
This would not only affect the integration of immigrants.
"From integration summits to conferences on Islam, it is already showing its first successes."
But it would be too early for a warning end.
Schäuble points out at the same time as in the German suburbs, there are no sociological problems from the point of view of urbanism as in France.
In the northern Parisian agglomerations, young people had engaged in serious street battles with the police during the last nights.
In Toulouse too, cars and public buildings burned down.
More efforts are being made to integrate the German government, which was required by the President of the Turkish Communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In view of the riots in France, Kolat warned against the "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany would certainly not be as explosive as in France.
However, there would still be a need to act.
Kolat emphasizes that the proportion of unemployed people under 25 years of age from immigration would be higher than the average.
More training places should be provided.
Kolat insisted: "We must give young people a perspective."
However, the President of the Turkish Communities added that social control in families was more in Germany than in France.
Many young immigrants also do not want to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolat urged: "But we must still be cautious."
Young people should be given the opportunity to participate in work and training.
In the meantime, in the Parisian faubourg of Villiers-le-Bel, everything remained very quiet during the night.
Police units were in place, a helicopter flew over the area with headlamps.
The authorities in office reported three arrests as well as a few burned cars and garbage.
Since the conference, an deployment of approximately 1000 security forces has calmed down.
The police will intervene as long as necessary, announced the Minister of the Interior Michelle Alliot-Marie, after a visit from the faubourg.
In Tuesday night, nearly 80 police officers were injured during riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The following night, the disturbances overwhelmed Toulouse.
The riots broke out after a traffic accident in which two young people had lost their lives on Sundays.
According to the first elements of the Prosecutor's Office, the police are not responsible for the death of young people.
In Angela Merkel's empire.
The chancellor's utopian entry shows that the coalition ended with the background - and there's nothing to wait for from her.
What country does this chancellor live in?
After his disheartening speech in the general debates of the German Parliament, which was chaotic and poor of content, it must be said: not here - not in the country which should ultimately be governed by it.
The reproach of concentrating too much on politics was pushed by Angela Merkel from a harsh and presumptuous sentence.
It's provincial, she said, and she just showed that she doesn't want to understand what critics want.
In Parliament, it has made visible to all the extent to which this complaint was correct.
There was neither any real interest nor little feeling for the country's problems to be felt.
Instead, Angela presented herself as a cloud: a political woman in the background, who runs away from foreign politics and who even stays there in the near vicinity.
For example, climate protection: in this regard, it still welcomes and still welcomes the Heiligendam agreements, but does not say how climate objectives should be achieved in our country.
Even, self-reliance - having so little modesty, the head of the CDU would have refused it two years ago.
Now she's stuck with all-made formulas, which growth would affect people.
It thus destroys its image of pragmatist, which solves problems rather than beautify the world.
But in the empire of the cloud Angela, internal policy problems are a marginal phenomenon.
Children's poverty and the concerns of low-wage workers?
He's got a few auxiliary phrases left for that.
In this regard, the number of times it spends on family allowances is revealing.
Here, Merkel needs three start-ups to pronounce a precise half sentence.
She's been in an unknown field from the moment it becomes concrete.
The Attack Branch
In the Youtube debate of Republican candidates for the Presidential, the two favourites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are engaged in a tough offensive battle - and now have to fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of the candidates is already on the first topic.
He would have made New York a "refuge for the clandestine," blamed Mitt Romney for his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
This one against his side by heavy reproach: "I would say that his own house was a haven for strangers," Giuliani answers and reproaches the former governor of Massachusetts for employing undocumented immigrants.
The candidates are attacking: since the Republican base also has no official favours, the eight presidential candidates use debates on CNN primarily to discredit their opponents.
The 30-second amateur films that Internet users have sent via Youtube are just more than blowers.
"It is with this kind of isolationism that we let Hitler come to power," launches John McCain to his candidate Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round to claim an immediate withdrawal of Iraq.
Romney also gets a strong lesson from Vietnam veterans when he refuses to condemn as torture what is called "Waterboarding", a method of questioning where the core is simulated.
However, the fact that the important themes of the campaign go beyond the war in Iraq and the debates on torture are reflected in the reactions of the St. Petersburg common room in Florida.
Whether conservative values are leased or future tax increases are refused, applause is delayed in the auditorium.
This is where the weaknesses of the two favourites remain.
"I made a mistake at that time," explained Romney and presented his excuses to the base and to the television audience for having been still a supporter of abortion in 1994.
Juliani, on the contrary, passes into a flowing knot when asked for his opinion on literal interpretations of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns for the first time as a civilian.
One day after his withdrawal as head of the army, the Pakistani power man Musharraf was invested as president.
So eight years of military rule is over.
The President of Pakistan Pervez Musharraf was invested on Thursday for a new five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live to the presidential palace of the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to respect the Constitution and to act for the well-being of the nation.
On Wednesday, he had sent his army chief charge to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thus coupled with international pressure, including that of the United States.
Eight years after his seizure of power by a putsch without bloodshed, the former general now reigns for the first time as head of civil status.
By withdrawing the position of Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, Musharraf had met the main requirement of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the end of the state of emergency that Musharraf decreed on November 3.
Shortly after his investiture Musharraf will suspend the state of emergency, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, and thus meet another requirement of the West.
The Supreme Court of the country, which Musharraf had occupied after establishing the state of emergency with lawyers in its ranks, had rejected last week all appeals against the controversial re-election of the Head of State on 6 October.
In the meantime, five soldiers were killed in the northern tribal region of North Waziristan in an attack on a military convoy and four others injured.
According to the military spokesman, a bomb exploded on a street near Afghanistan's border.
Krautrock's fathers are returning.
Germany's supergroups of the 1970's are playing: the three members of the Harmonia group once again took their console in a concert in Berlin.
For their return, recordings of their great success "Live 1974" were published.
Already at that time, they were better known abroad.
The expected sensation then occurs in the form of three gentlemen announced on the evening poster.
Everyone has his little box in front of him, his cable and first of all his buttons.
Dieter Moebius, 63 years old, thrones in the middle in a white shirt like snow.
He is flanked to the left by 57-year-old Michael Rother with a laptop and a guitar.
To the right, observed by the entire auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, curves on his console.
Everyone contributes to the noise, including a Beat.
And sometimes this is added by inadvertent to a piece of traditional music.
This does not seem to bother the gentlemen themselves too much.
The fact that the Harmonia group plays again assured some emos among Krautrock’s amateurs.
We have the right to reveal it here: targeted surveys reveal that, of course, the name is reasoning in the collective memory of the pop, but in no way as long as it is so durable that this group has also been painlessly lacking for 32 years.
But why would not the German also have the right to celebrate his living legends of the 1970s?
Especially since what is falsely called "Krautrock" has been more and more abundant in England and America than in the country of origin.
When the music industry awarded in 2003 the Echo prize to the survivors of the Cologne Can group for their work, the German pop faces interrogators were seen in the hall.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the groups La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the Panegyrical Praise, the surprise no longer had limits.
Later, during the concerts, Michael Rother jumped on the scene of Red Hot Chili Peppers as an old friend.
The problem of ignorance in oneself and the transfiguration in the unknown is the only one.
The memory is therefore already taken by Harmonia, because the trio existed only two years and that during this period, the impact power felt was much weaker than what was subsequently attributed to it by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promising name of Cluster.
First we played in the cellars below the Berlin scene.
After Düsseldorf, for a church-subsidised label, for financial reasons.
Rother had briefly embarked on Kraftwerk and had finally made himself a guitarist with Neu!, who was at the time perhaps the most radical German group.
By 1973, however, Rother followed the musicians of Cluster in exile in the Weserbergland forests.
There, in an ancient Weser farm, a 16th century ruin, they lived as members of communities fleeing the city.
Less ideological than in the community "Kommune I", where Roedelius had the right to be tormented as a nurse.
Rather an artistic existence like Spitzweg.
So-called was in the trash a fan of the choir Harmonia Ottenstein and also a name for art.
Many hold Harmonia away from this.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia", and the following "De Luxe".
Because also serene and modest as music sounded, the group suffered from material misery.
The harvest of dead wood was not used by himself in the search for itself.
The "Live 1974" CD that has just appeared was recorded at a concert in Griess in front of a record audience of almost 50 heads, as well as someone believes to remember.
At that time, Rother expressed the desire to force Harmonia to train from time to time.
It was for Roedelius and Moebius an immoral requirement.
The group announced its separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the spheres of esotericism and ensured his existence with albums like "Flammende Herzen" (burning hearts).
Cluster revives itself in the eighties and has been more successful than Harmonia has ever had.
We owe the album Live de Griessem to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His label Grönland set itself the goal of maintaining Krautrock as a German contribution inherent in contemporary music.
Neu! had already been deserted on this occasion as the personal work of Rodeelius.
The physical resurrection of Harmony takes place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
Publicly subsidized, as part of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is here, the British, the former punk and author of the book "Krautrock Sampler".
There's also the inventor of Loveparade, Dr. Motte.
By which the whole margin of fluctuation of Krautrock's influence would be identified with respect to future pop music.
The place left empty by the group will be filled by Harmonia.
Brian Eno's sentence is in the room in the middle of the singular sounds: "The only real music, you listen to the future."
There are pictures showing producers with Harmonia in the farm room.
The projections of other black and white pictures of bazaar wired tools are used for the formation of the legend.
Before that, the three veterans are again busy improvising.
But more by glued microphones to the organ and battery, to pull the instruments from the unheard-of sounds through the instruments with built effects themselves.
Today, electronic music resembles electronic music.
The three in great technical fignolers.
Even the choir of the house will not change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, one coughs and whispers under the sound cloud, and sings at a beautiful moment "Aaaaaaaah" with emphasis.
Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
It never meant rock.
Roots were less sought in the blues than in the conservatories of music (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or in the leak of artistic or social conventions (Cluster).
He who shouts "68" is not entirely wrong, and Harmonia is no longer irritated by it now.
But what goes the most of itself will be carefully covered on the stage.
Where does the music start and where does it end?
This can hit someone's nerves (?) or grant fleeting moments of great joy.
Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough.
With "The Hunting Party" and "Kill Peace", two films once again address the Balkan War.
But both of them don't convince.
Whether the projects rely too much on action and foolish exchanges or on the contrary, they are too horrid.
Here, even Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help.
The good news first: although war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the Balkan mountains, this is precisely where, in the most lucid of the war in Bosnia, actor Richard Gere is then found.
We had finally lost sight of the most beautiful man in the eighties, because too many gentle and futile roles in films with feelings for women and too many press conferences on the subject of Buddhism delighted him to show himself.
Today Richard Gere is the most important argument to look at yet "The Hunting Party" - when the hunter becomes the hunter (why should today's films be as long and confusing as collective agreements of locomotive drivers?)
He gives a magnificent representation full of eyelashes: at the bottom, his character of war reporter Simon Hunt is what Gere could have become, if the destiny and film industry were not so benevolent: a man who has his best moments long behind him, but who, even as a monument in ruins to his decline, has nevertheless kept visible remains of his former charm.
But despite this asset, "The Hunting Party" continues together with the German production "murdered Peace", which also comes out this week, the endless suite of missed movies on the Balkan War.
The "murdered peace" can be made quickly: the film speaks of two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who rescue a Serb from Kosovar snipers, in which one of the two falls quickly still in love.
Although it is welcome that the Serbs are not once presented as the only causes of all evils, this film as flat as a telefilm is lost too quickly in the action and the exchange of foolish shots.
This remains a sort of "Alarm for Cobra 11" without a highway but with a war in place.
On the contrary, one can examine in the perfect example of "The Hunting Party", why there has never been a real good film about the Balkan War.
The story of the three U.S. war reporters, who are conditioned to track down the high war criminal "the fox", might have become, with another director and another screenwriter (both Richard Shepard), at another time a new "Apocalypse Now".
Because stories are strikingly similar: two males go on a small team in the forest, to accomplish something that the military cannot do and for both males, it becomes a journey in madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that we simply do not let Simon Hunt be the deserted cynic with a heart, as it is presented to us at the beginning.
No, the script must also assign him a romantic adventure with a Bosnian subsequently murdered.
Then "The Hunting Party" becomes definitely bad, when the reporter, in the space of the last five minutes, by an accelerated process, achieves that NATO, the CIA and all the world's bounty hunters failed in five years: catch the war criminal and leave him for just revenge to the Muslim Bosnians.
It is so bad that the International Court of the Hague of Crime against Cinematographic Logic should be seized.
In this case, the film has too deep a human concern.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still free, and he suspects the Americans and the French (here they must be exceptionally agreed) not to drive the hunt quite intensively because of secret political agreements.
But good intentions and evil are so similar this time that a famous Brecht poem comes to our mind.
He speaks of an Asian demon's wooden mask on the poet's work table: "Compatible, I see the veins of the swollen forehead, clearly: how tiring it is to be wicked."
Films such as "The Hunting Party" have exactly such tumescent heads, but suggest how tiring it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the kind of movies about the Balkans war.
Recently, it has been reported in this paper that all Hollywood films on Iraq were big flops.
We can add: there have never been good films on South Africa yet.
Which is worth every time: when a star hangs on a crisis home or on a field of mines, it comes out then something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Jenseits go Grenzen" with Angelina Jolie or "Blutdiamanten" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
It is possible that all these conflicts are simply too close in time.
Anyway, decades have passed before Hollywood can turn a good film on the Holocaust with Schindler's list.
Some films still have to mature - those that today are worth classical works on Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" have not been celebrated unanimously at their time as masterpieces.
But perhaps we also know today just too much about the world's conflicts, where each hecatomb comes live on two screens at the same time at home,
And it's a pleasure for writers to miss the scruples they need to tell beautiful stories.
"Being or not being" or "The dictator" has actually become as good as it is because Lubtisch and Chaplin did not yet know how much the Nazi regime really dominated.
Maybe you don't want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Perhaps you need to have the sarcastic and distant artistic look of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel "Dictionaire de Lemprière" and the Balkan War, he replied: "It is only because some things never change."
"The great cities will always be horridly dangerous, the men will always be murdered in a horrifying way and the war will always reign in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust reaps criticism for the cancellation of the Olympiads.
The mayor's withdrawal from Hamburg's candidacy for the Summer Olympics has met in politics and the economy with virulent criticism.
Many want to continue fighting for the Games by the water.
But Von Beust calls for realism in the appreciation of opportunities.
The Chief Director of the Chamber of Commerce of Hamburg, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, described on Wednesday an abandonment as "bad for the local economy".
In recent times, no other project has deployed as much motivational forces in the city as the idea of the Olympiads.
"Without this objective, the political-sport momentum could not have been maintained in the same measures."
Schmidt-Trenz invites the Senate not to bury the project, but to find it a new longer-term starting point, "which takes another modified agenda as its starting point".
Mayor Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday in his previous statements, according to which the Olympic ambitions of Hamburg were unrealistic until at least 2028.
"It was not Hamburg who decided to apply for the Olympics, but the German Federation of Olympic Sports," said Von Beust at WELT ONLINE.
He refers to the expected decision of the Sports Federation in early December, about Munich's candidacy for the 2018 Winter Games.
This preference means for us, that, in the time span we had planned until 2028 so far, we will have no chance."
However, the dream does not belong permanently in the past, said Von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regretted Beust's statements.
This would give the impression that Hamburg no longer wants to apply for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It is too early to close an opportunity, burying the projects already now," said HSB President Günter Ploß on Wednesday.
An abandonment of the candidacy would be more in contradiction with the statements made by the Chief of the Senate on the occasion of the reception at the plenary meeting of the German Federation of Higher Sports Schools.
There, Von Beust would have called Hamburg's candidacy to the 2015 universities as not "a substitute" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The Federation of Higher Sports Schools had first been appointed Hamburg as a candidate city in the past weeks.
The Mayor's SPD fraction accused the Senate of not using this precious time in housing construction in Hamburg.
"The development of the Small Grassbrook was rejected by the Senate for years because it played the map of the Olympiades and excluded the construction of housing," said SPD delegates Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has always claimed for the Small Grassbrook an integrated plan in the Olympiades and subsequent use of housing, the CDU would have placed exclusively on the "Event factor".
The candidacy for the 2012 Summer Olympic Games would have raised a great enthusiasm in Hamburg.
Hamburg had, however, broken up against Leipzig.
It's not Warhols' boxes.
He who connects the concepts of Sweden and wooden caisse, thinks of Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
At the moment, wooden boxes made in Sweden cast shadows on Warhol's works list.
Most of the eighty-ten Brillo-Boxes of "Type Stockholm" listed there are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" questioned a few months ago the authenticity of the Brillo-Boxes of the 1968 year of Andy Warhol, the internal research of the Moderna Museet de Stockholm today led to a disappointing result: the six "Brillo-Boxes", of which the former director of the museum Pontus Hulten gave gifts in 1995 to the Moderna Museet, are copies - as well as a large part of the other hundreds of Brillo-Boxen of "Type Stockholm", which circulate on the international market of art.
The ancient history is enclosed, a decoying chain of artistic and curatory productions.
In 1964, Warhol created in New York his first "Brillo-Boxes", painted wooden boxes, which are based on the red-blue-white design of "Brillo" powdered soapboards.
An exhibition of his work at Moderna Museet presented in 1968 - with the Warhol agreement - hundreds of cases made of cardboard Brillo: They did not come (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but had been delivered directly from the Brillo cardboard factory.
These were not works of art here, but rather their models, exhibition samples.
At the same time, Warhol had given permission in 1968 to produce some Brillo wooden boxes in Sweden, which were not exposed to the Moderna Museet.
Witnesses of the time now speak of about fifteen wooden crates that would then be entered into the history of art and auctions, as an original Brillo-Boxes of Andy Warhol authorized, with the title "Type Stockholm".
Some of them have reached more than $100,000 in auction sales.
The problem now is that the legendary director of the Pontus Hulten Museum wrongly claimed that about a hundred wooden boxes had been produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol had subsequently given him.
Indeed, the 105 Hultén caisses were produced in Malmö only in 1990 for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By that time, Warhol had already been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, chief curator of the Moderna Museet, examined, alongside the six Brillo-Boxes of the museum, three other Swedish private collections, including two were made in Stockholm in 1968: their laminated panels were first printed and laid, then applied with a paint brush to white oil.
The texture of the copies dating from 1990 reveals instead that the painting was applied directly without background on laminated panels, using a roll of paint - moreover it is not an oil paint, but an acrylic.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of the Brillo-Boxes of Andy Warhol," says the director of the Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come up with another decision, the Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in its collection as copies/exhibition material."
As early as July, the Authentication Board announced, of course, that it would investigate the "burden charges" that will be raised in the case of powdered soap boxes.
But since we've been there with an inexorable silence.
Manila's Rebel Soldiers Abandon
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers quit, the same ones who had left in a hotel in Manila, and who had demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who blamed the President for the corruption and electoral fraud, told reporters in the hotel that he could not respond to any bloodshed.
Soldiers loyal to power had just before attacked the hotel using tear gas.
The two dozen soldiers had been torn apart for hours in the building.
About half of them stood before the courts on Wednesday because of a failed putsch attempt in 2003 - including Trillanes.
He took advantage of the audience to eclipse suddenly with about 30 sympathizers.
The military police officers, who normally had to monitor them, had apparently deserted themselves in his favor and joined his mutiny.
They entered the Hotel Peninsula and demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
The troops loyal to power locked the area around the respectable hotel.
The President convened an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
The National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the action of the soldiers.
"People have enough," Trillanes said.
"We call people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who commanded prior to the elite unit of the Scout Rangers, said that other units of the army soon wanted to join the march.
Critics of the regime had called for a major demonstration against the President on Wednesday.
His government has been surrounded by corruption complaints for months.
The Manila Finance District has already been the theatre of the mutiny attempt of about 200 military members against Arroyo since 2003.
The insurrection broke about 24 hours after the army refused to join it.
Since 1986 there have already been at least seven attempts at putsch against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a main shareholder of Versatel.
United Internet has ensured a participation of more than 20 per cent of the Versatel telecommunications company.
The average price per share is 14.46 euros, as the company communicated on Wednesday.
Only 20.05 per cent of the share capital would be held.
We had previously speculated on a purchase.
The option would remain open to further increase participation in Versatel.
With this step we seek to accelerate the consolidation of the German market for DSL, has communicated United Internet.
Just before, assumptions had already been made on Wednesday about an entry, after the Berenberg Bank increased its participation in the Düsseldorf network operator from 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The credit institution would hold the money only for a third party, we tell it on the market.
On the previous day, United Internet had already acquired nearly 10 percent participation in the Drillisch mobile phone company.
As part of an increase in capital, Drillisch placed 17.4 million new shares worth EUR 106.4 million in stock exchange.
United Internet purchased 5.15 million for 31.1 million euros.
In addition, companies have opened negotiations on cooperation in the marketing of DSL products and mobile telephony.
"We are strengthening our partnership," explained a spokesperson for United Internet.
Both companies founded the company with MSP participation in order to absorb the competitor Freenet.
For the time being, the two companies want to be satisfied with their participation of ten percent at Freenet, and do not make use of their right to wear 18.49 percent extra at Freenet, entrusted United Internet Thursday.
However, the two companies would leave each other open, particularly to increase participation in SA Freenet, learned.
The negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership had ended in mid-October.
Poker still hardly predictable on Freenet that has lasted for months is part of the consolidation of the German telecommunications market.
Freenet had at the end of the third quarter 2.9 million customers linked to a mobile telephone contract and 1.27 million DSL customers and full subscriptions.
The United Internet Holding and Drillisch have so far had a direct participation in Freenet of 6.01 percent.
It was now agreed that Drillisch would bring about four per cent more.
The right to purchase 18.49 per cent of the Vatas investment company had already been decided in August.
