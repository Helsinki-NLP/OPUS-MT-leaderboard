Members of the National Assembly of Wales are concerned about the fact that they might give the impression that they are "marionettes"
Many members of the National Assembly of Wales are dismayed because they have been suggested to change their title, and they are called MWP (members of the Welsh Parliament).
This issue was caused by plans to change the name of the assembly in the Wales Parliament.
Members of the National Assembly of Wales present on the political scene fear that this would cause ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party of the National Assembly of Wales is concerned that he is “smooth with Twp and Pwp”.
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, "twp" means "obtuz" and "pwp" means "faecal matter".
A member of the Wales Party of the National Assembly of the Wales Nation said that overall the group “is not pleased” and suggested alternatives.
One member of the Conservative Party stated that the group has an "open" attitude to the change of name, but that it also noted that "MWP" resembles "Muppet".
In this context, the letter "w" is pronounced in Wales as the letter "u" in English spoken in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing the legislation to introduce a change of name, said: "The final decision on how the members of the Assembly are appointed will certainly depend on even those members."
The Law of 2017 on the Government of Wales provided the Assembly with the opportunity to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which revealed that many of them wish to use the Welsh Parliament.
With regard to the title of the members of the National Assembly of Wales, the Commission preferred "members of the Parliament of Wales" or "WMP", but the option "MWP" received most votes in the public consultation.
It seems that members of the National Assembly of Wales suggested alternative options, but the attempt to reach a consensus could give the head of Elin Jones, the chairman of the steering committee, who is expected to submit the draft law on changes over the past few weeks.
Reform legislation will include further changes in the way the meeting works, including rules on the disqualification of members and the structure of the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly will have the last word on their title when the law is debated.
Macedonians vote for the referendum on the change of country name
On this Sunday, citizens with the right to vote will express their views on the change in the name of their country in the "Northern Republic of Macedonia".
The popular vote was organized to resolve an old dispute for a few decades with Greece, the neighbouring country, which has its own province called Macedonia.
The government of Athens has long consistently argued that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim on its territory and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia's EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, a vehement opponent of the plebiscite on the change of name, said he would not consider this vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that the change of name is only a compromise that will allow them to join the EU and NATO.
The church bells of St. Martin stopped beating as a result of the problems facing the churches in Harlem
"From a historical point of view, the veterans of the place I was talking to told me that you used to find a bar and a church on every corner of the street," Adams said.
"Today there are no more bars and churches."
He also said that the disappearance of the bars is understandable.
"People socialize differently today," he said.
"Bars no longer have the role of living room for the entire neighborhood, where people gather regularly."
And as far as churches are concerned, it is concerned that the money obtained from the sale of goods will be spent faster than the leaders expect and that, " sooner or later, the dissolution will be the same".
He added that churches could be replaced by residential buildings with condominiums filled with people who will not support the remaining sanctuaries of the neighborhood.
“Most people who will buy condominiums in these buildings will be white,” he said, “so this will accelerate the closure of churches, because it is unlikely that many people moving into these condominiums will become members of those churches.”
Both churches were built by congregations made up of white people before Harlem became a metropolis of African-American people – the Metropolitan Community of St. Martin in 1870, a decade ago.
The original Methodist Congregation, made up of white persons, moved from that area after 1930.
A congregation of African - American people, who carried out their religious activities nearby, took over the building.
The St. Martin Church was taken over by an African-American congregation, led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who boycotted merchants on 125th Street, a main street for shopping in Harlem, which opposed the engagement or promotion of African-American people.
A fire that took place in 1939 affected the building very much, but Father Johnson's huge plans were made to rebuild it and included the chameleon in them.
Reverend David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor to St. Martin's church, called the "polls of the poor."
The expert who put the charilon into operation in July described it differently: "a cultural treasure" and "a historical instrument to be replaced".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also stated that he was the world's first charilian acted by an African-American musician Dionysio A. Lind, who moved to a bigger charilone, at the Church of Riverside 18 years ago.
Merriweather said it wasn't replaced at St. Martin's.
What has been heard from St. Martin in recent months has been a complicated story, which has included architects and contractors, some brought by church deacons, others by episcopal diocese.
The sacristy, the governing entity of the parish, formed of deacons, wrote to the diocese in July to complain that it "will seek to pass the costs" to the sacristy, even if it was not involved in the employment of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some of the huge ones complained about the lack of transparency from which he gave evidence of diocese.
A shark wounded a 13-year-old kid trying to catch lobsters in California
According to authorities, Saturday, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old child while swimming, trying to catch lobsters in California on the day of the homar season.
The attack took place around 7 a.m. near the beach Beacon in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel said for the position of KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was swimming for about half an hour, along with his friends, in the morning of Saturday, when he heard a little boy screaming for help and then moved along with a group that helped him get him out of the water.
Hammel also said that, initially, he thought the boy was happy to catch a lobster, but then he realized that he was shouting, “He bit me!
He bit me!"
The whole clavicle was broken, Hammel said he noticed when he got to the boy.
"I cried out to everyone in the water and told them to get out of the water: "There's a shark in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was taken with the helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is still in critical condition.
The shark species responsible for the attack is unknown.
The Salvamar, Captain Larry Giles, told a press conference that a shark was observed in the area a few weeks ago, but it was concluded that it is not a shark species that is a danger.
Giles added that the victim suffered trauma at the upper end of the trunk.
The authorities restricted access from the Ponto beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigations and safety reasons .
Giles mentioned that there are more than 135 shark species in that area, but many of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury Retailer plans to strengthen its position on the market for beauty products and British fashion
Sainsbury takes over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, making available radiation with beauty products in the style of a universal store, with specialized sales assistants.
As part of a consolidation of position on the market for beautification products in the United Kingdom, worth £2.8 billion, which continues to grow, although domestic and fashion sales are not tailor-made, larger beams with beautification products will be tested in 11 stores in the country and will be integrated into several shops in the following year, if they prove successful.
Investment in the beauty industry comes in the context where supermarkets are looking for a way to use the previous space for televisions, microwaves and household products.
Representatives of Sainsbury Retalier said that the number of beauty products they offer will be doubled, reaching up to 3,000 products, including, for the first time, marks such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing games, such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, will also receive more space, with marked areas, similar to those in Boots stores.
Also, the supermarket revives its range of makeup products, Boutique, which means that most products are intended for vegan people, an increasingly popular demand among young buyers.
In addition, the products of the French retailer The Fragrance Shop will be included in two shops of the Sainsbury chain, for testing purposes, the first being the open one last week in Croydon, in southern London, and the second in Selly Oak, Birmingham, in the second part of this year.
Online shopping and the tendency to buy smaller quantities of food every day from the nearest food store means that supermarkets need to find new ways to motivate people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, Executive Director of Sainsbury Retaliator, said that outlets will increasingly look like universal stores, because supermarket chains are trying to cope with the fight with large discounted stores, Aldi and Lidl, which offer more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury has included both products from Argos outlet in hundreds of shops and Habitats since it purchased both chains two years ago, which means it has recorded increases in food sales as well as increased profits.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to refresh its pharmaceutical and beauty compartments failed.
Sainsbury tried to merge with Boots in the early 2000s, but the negotiations ended after a diverged on how Boots' sales were divided into its supermarkets.
The new strategy was designed after Sainsbury sold its pharmaceutical business that included 281 stores, Celesio company, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
This means that Lloyds will play an important role in the plan, adding a wide range of luxury brands for skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director of Sainsbury Retalier said: "We have transformed the appearance of our rays with beauty products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in the specialized training of our colleagues, who will be at your disposal to give you advice.
Our range of brands can be adapted to all needs, and the attractive environment and convenient locations turn us into an extraordinary location to purchase beauty products, revolutionizing the old way of shopping".
Peter Jones is angry after Holly Willoughby retired from a £11 million contract
The TV protagonist "Dragons' Den", Peter Jones, is furious after TV show Holly Willoughby retired from a £11 million contract with his lifestyle company to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby does not have time to get involved in their project on the Truly brand, which includes household accessories and household items.
The couple company was compared to the Goop brand owned by Gwyneth Paltew.
Presentation of the 37-year-old "This Morning" show announced on Instagram that it would withdraw.
Holly Willoughby generated the anger of Peter Jones, the protagonist of the "Dragons‘ Den", withdrawing at the last moment from their business offering lifestyle services to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones became angry when one of the most beloved television people recognized Tuesday, during a tense meeting at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that its new contracts, worth up to £1.5 million, no longer allow them to dedicate their brand, Truly, which includes accessories and household items.
The company was compared with Gwyneth Paltow's Goop brand and almost doubled Willoughby's wealth, with an estimated value of £11 million.
After Willoughby, 37-year-old, announced on Instagram that he would give up the Truly contract, Jones left Britain to take refuge in one of his holiday homes.
One source stated: “Truly was by far one of Holly’s priorities.
It had to be her long-term future, for the next two decades.
The decision to withdraw shocked everyone.
No one could believe what happened Tuesday, it was a little bit until the launch.
There is a warehouse full of products at Marlow headquarters that are ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the presenter of the "This Morning" show, which is among the best-selling stars in Britain, could bring millions of damages to the company as a result of investments in products such as pillows and candles, clothing and household items, as well as possible further delay of launch.
It can also be the end of a long-term friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children, and Dan Baldwin, her husband, are ten-year-old friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby put the Truly brand base together with Capp in 2016, and Jones, aged 52, joined them as director in March.
Couples spend their holidays together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production company's shares.
Willoughby will become the M&S Trademark Ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of the I'm A Celebrity TV show.
A nearby source of Jones said last night: “We don’t want to comment on his business.”
I was really tough, and then "we fell in love"
He made jokes about the critics he will receive from journalists because he made a comment that some would consider "no president" and that he has such a positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump take such a big step back?
Trump said imitating a voice of "newsperson."
"I didn't take a step back."
He said Kim was interested in having another meeting after the initial meeting in Singapore in June was described by Trump as an enormous step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But the negotiations on denuclearisation have ceased.
More than three months after the Singapore Summit in June, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea did not observe a "response" from the United States regarding the previous disarmament efforts of North Korea.
On the other hand, it noted that the United States continues to issue sanctions to put pressure on this.
Trump had a more optimistic view in his motivational speech.
"Everything is going well with regard to North Korea," he said.
“We were about to go to a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a great relationship."
He also said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had positive results: cessation of missile tests, support for the release of the hostages and return of the American military.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to act like a president, but if I behave like this, instead of the 10,000 people outside, who try to enter this incapacitating arena, it would be about 200 people," Trump said, showing to the crowd who are in front of him.
A tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia devastated an island, causing the death of hundreds of people
After the Lombok earthquake, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that their aid was not necessary.
Although more than 10% of the Lombok Island population has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared a necessary condition for triggering aid actions at international level.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, it has been very clear that I am not asking for international assistance, so it is a rather difficult situation," Subong said.
Although the “Save Children” Foundation tries to form a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet known whether foreign staff are allowed access to the site.
Sutopo, the spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said the Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies can contribute to aid efforts.
Given the earthquakes sustained by Indonesia constantly, it is unlikely that the country will continue to be insufficiently prepared for the anger of nature.
Although tsunami shelters were built in Aceh , they are not very often encountered on other coasts .
It seems that the lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although a warning was issued in this regard, could have contributed to the loss of lives.
Even in the best of circumstances, travel between islands in Indonesia proves to be a challenge.
Natural disasters complicate this even more.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake is heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the place where the new calamity occurred.
President Joko Widodo proposed that Indonesia's precarious infrastructure be the focal point of its electoral campaign and that it allocated money prominently for roads and railways.
But the lack of funds affected Joko's administration, which will participate next year in a new election campaign.
Joko also faces persistent pressure from the sects of Indonesia, as members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes, as the gangs of Christians and Muslims fought on the streets, using stakes, bows and arrows, as well as other rudimentary weapons.
Video: Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool gives the saving goal and equals the score in the match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat in the Premier League in front of the Chelsea team, with a goal in the 89th minute, Saturday, at the Stamford Bridge football stadium in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri, while he was about 30 meters from the opponent's gate, and his team was headed by Chelsea at 1-0.
He hit the ball and sent it to the left before giving a kick in the direction of the gate.
The ball reached above the side of the pole, heading towards the corner at the top right of the gate.
Finally, the ball passed by Kepa Arrizabalaga who jumped to it and fell into the gate.
"I just had to try to get in the ideal position, get the ball, and players like Shaq always try to advance as much as possible, so I tried to get as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and it was enough, I didn't think much about it, I just took over the ball further."
Chelsea drove 1-0 to the break after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The attacker of the blue team sent the ball to Mateo Kovacic, and then returned to the middle of the field and ran to half the land of the Liverpool team.
Kovacic made a quick move of one-two in the middle of the field.
Then he sent the ball to Hazard, who went in the way.
Hazard overcame the defense and sent the ball to the net, able to hit it with his left leg and get past the player Alisson Becker from Liverpool.
Liverpool will have a match against the Napoli team in the leagues of the Champions League on Wednesday at 15:00, on Sao Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play against the Videoton team in UEFA Europe League Thursday at 15:00, London.
The number of deaths caused by the tsunami in Indonesia reached 832
The number of deaths caused by the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia reached 832, according to the national disaster agency, in the morning of Sunday.
Several people were caught under the ruins of buildings collapsed by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that took place on Friday and triggered waves up to 6 metres, said the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has a population of over 380,000, was covered by the remains caused by the collapse of buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man, suspected of killing a woman by stab
A murder investigation was initiated after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 in the morning, with stab wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, and was arrested a man suspected of murder.
The police asked the people in the area who heard or saw anything related to this subject to come to the statement section.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in the early stages, but I appeal to all people near John Street in Birkenhead who have heard or seen something suspicious to contact us.
I also wish to ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who have registered any useful material with the help of the room on board to contact us if they have essential information for our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the body belongs to a woman in Birkenhead and was found on a property.
This afternoon, some people came to the crime scene who think they knew the woman to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are in progress, and the police said they were trying to inform the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews tried to return to his own apartment, but he was told by the police that no one is allowed to enter the building.
He was shocked when he found out what happened.
People living in the building were told it would take a few hours until they were allowed in.
A police officer told a person that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
On the spot, there was a woman in tears.
Repeatedly "it's so terrible!".
At 14:00, two police vans were in the perimeter and one more was outside.
A few police officers were standing in the perimeter, monitoring the apartment block.
Any person with information is asked to send a direct message to the @MerPolCC police, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at the phone number 0800 555 111 and refer to case 247 of 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell from Parliament becomes the most recent memorial monument affected by the altercations on "History Registration"
Removing it would represent a poetic justice for the Taliban-style destruction of both the cultural and religious artifacts of England, carried out by his fanatical Puritan descendants.
But Cromwell described Jeremy Crick's suggestion as "crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in the current debate about the removal of statues as a figure of Oliver Cromwell from outside the Westminster Palace to become a target.
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Maybe he'd sacrifice a wrong Cromwell for the actions of his ancestor Thomas from the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell, made by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is evidence of the 19th century opinion and part of the history of a figure that many believe deserves to celebrate.
Goldsmith said for The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, monarchy.
Whether it is an exact representation, this is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
But surely, the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has led to the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable individual figure, which is part of this division.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and celebrated."
A pig caused the death of a farmer from China
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local media agencies.
The man, identified only after the name "Yuan", was found dead after being sectioned an artery and covered with blood, near a pig farm located in the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, according to the Sunday editorial of Morning Post in South China.
A pig farmer was preparing to inject pig vaccines at a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining Province of Qinghai, China.
Apparently he had come with his cousin from nearby Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of an adjacent cottage was open.
He said that in the cottage there was a large-scale male pig with blood in his mouth.
The forensic doctors confirmed that a pig of about 300 kg caused the farmer's death, according to the report.
"My cousin's hairs were full of blood and sore," said the cousin, whose last name is "Wu", for Guiyang Evening News.
The surveillance cameras registered Yuan entering the market on Thursday at 4:40 in the morning to feed their pigs.
About an hour later, his body was found.
The animal that caused the death of the man did not belong to Yuan, nor to his cousin.
A market representative told Evening News that the pig was closed to prevent him from attacking someone else, while the police collected evidence from the crime scene.
It appears that Yuan's family and authorities are negotiating compensation for its death.
Although rare, cases of pigs that attacked people have been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injury to the man.
10 years ago, because of a pig of 300 kg, a man from Wales was blocked in his tractor until his wife came to scare and drive the animal away.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the taste of blood can trigger such reactions."
"It's easy to play.
They like to bite, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to give them proper respect," he said.
Hurricane Rosa, who has lost its intensity, will cause torrential rain in the southwestern United States
As expected, Hurricane Rosa loses its intensity as it moves to cooler waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring rains that will cause floods in northern Mexico and southwestern the United States in the following days.
Rosa records wind conditions at a speed of 85 km/h, being a Category 1 hurricane from 5 a.m. on Sunday and was located approximately 600 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to arrive in the north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depressive area has begun to form over the Pacific Ocean and is moving eastward to the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula, on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, it will begin to push intense tropical humidity from the north to the south-west of the United States.
Monday, Rosa will bring precipitation up to 25 cm in some parts of Mexico.
Then the tropical humidity that will interact with the depressed zone will generate plenty of rain in the south-west in the following days.
Local rainfall between 3 and 10 cm will cause hazardous rapid flooding, waste streams and, possibly, landslides in the desert.
Intensive tropical humidity will cause precipitation rates up to 5 and 8 cm per hour in certain areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Precipitation between 5 and 10 cm is expected in the south-west, especially in most of Arizona.
Rapid flooding may occur due to rapidly deteriorating conditions as a result of the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It is not recommended to venture in the desert on foot, given the threat posed by tropical rain.
Strong rain could cause the caniones to be turned into violent rivers, and storms will bring local winds into gusts and dust.
The area of depression approaching will bring torrential rain to areas on the southern coast of California.
Precipitation of nearly 2 cm is possible, which could result in minor flows of residues and slippery roads.
These will be the first rainfall in the region, in the wet season.
Tropical rains scattered will begin to approach Arizona on the second part of Sunday and the first part of Monday, before the rain spread more than Monday and Tuesday.
Intense rainfall will spread into so-called "four corners" Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
In October there will be intense changes in temperature in the United States, as the Arctic region will become colder, but the tropics remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature at short distances.
On Sunday, dramatic differences of temperature are encountered at the central area of the US.
There is a temperature difference of almost 10 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the prolonged heat of summer will try to form and expand again.
It is expected that much of the central and eastern US area will face a hot start in October, with temperatures of up to 27 degrees in extended areas, from the southern fields to certain parts of the north-east.
Tuesday, New York City could reach 27 degrees, about 4 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates high chances of temperatures above average for the US east until the first half of October.
Over 20 million people followed Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people followed the press statement supported by the Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, and the woman who accused him of a sexual attack that was supposed to have taken place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
At the same time, the political confrontation continued, TV stations interrupting the normal Friday program for a last-minute news: an agreement concluded between Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona for the FBI to conduct an investigation of the charges for a week.
Ford told the panel that he was 100% sure that Kavanaugh had harassed her while she was drunk and tried to undress her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an intense testimony, said that it is 100% certain that this did not happen.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million people would have followed the hearing on Friday.
The company counted average viewing on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not available immediately for other networks that transmitted it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people watching from the office.
To put this in perspective, this audience is similar to that for a football game in play-off or with Academy Awards.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose hosts strongly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, was in front of all channels, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the daily hearing.
ABC was in second place, with a number of 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS was followed by 3.1 million people, 2.94 million NBC, 2.89 million MSNBC, and 2.52 million CNN.
Interest remained at a high level after hearing.
Flake was at the center of the drama on Friday.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, he was filmed by the CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning while protestors shouted at him and he was trying to get up in an elevator at a session of the Judicial Committee.
He was looking down for a few minutes while people were arguing, and everything was live on CNN.
"I'm right here in front of you," said a woman.
“ Do you think he's telling us the truth?
He was told: "You have power, while so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office issued a statement and said, before the elevator was closed, that he would have more to say at the committee meeting.
Televisions later broadcast the vote on the Judicial Committee to advance Kavanaugh's nomination for the Senate's vote.
But Flake said he would do this only if the FBI agreed to analyze the charges against the nominee next week, which the minority democrats demanded.
Flake was largely convinced of conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake's decision came after a conversation with Coons and several senators after that.
Flake's choice was an important one, obviously the Republicans wouldn't have the necessary votes to approve Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accuses criticism of "political games" on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accuses criticism of her plans to leave the European Union of "political games" with the future of Britain and the undermining of national interests in an interview for the Sunday Times newspaper.
Theresa May, Prime Minister of Great Britain, attended the conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview next to the one accompanied by his photograph on the front page of the newspaper, former Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued an attack on his plan for Brexit, the so-called Chequers plan, saying that the proposal that Britain and the European Union collect each other's tariffs was "completely ridiculous".
Wayde Sims' shooting: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, suspected of killing LSU player
Police arrested a suspect in the case of the deadly shooting of Wayde Sims, the basketball player at LSU, 20 years old.
Dyteon Simpson, a 20-year-old, was arrested and imprisoned, being charged with murder by grade 2, according to Baton Rouge police department.
The authorities published the video of Sims and Simpson's confrontation, and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered the glasses from the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to WAFB, CBS affiliate.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police say he recognized that he shot Wayde dead.
His bail was set at $350,000, according to the lawyer.
Baton Rouge Legal Medicine Bureau published a preliminary report on Friday, saying that death was caused by a head shot through the neck.
The department deserves the Louisiana police force, the state police forensics laboratory, Southern University police and citizens in that area, for the aid offered in the investigation, which led to the arrest in question.
The athletic director LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the police for "diligence and the search for justice".
Sims was 20.
The attacker with a height of 1.98 m grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, played basketball for LSU.
Last season, it averaged 5.6 points and had 2.6 recoveries.
Friday morning, coach of the LSU basketball team, Will Wade, said the team was "devasted" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"This worries me all the time," Wade said.
A volcano threw an ash column over Mexico City
The ashes from the Popocatepetl volcano arrived in the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexican citizens Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the crater activity began and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The center monitors several horribles and vibrations.
The images on the social networks presented thin layers of ash on the windshields of cars in the neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicians observed an increase in the activity of the volcano located 72 km south-east of the capital, after an earthquake of 7.1 magnitude shook the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
A dispute between the police and Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters fought with the gendarmes, at the first anniversary of Catalonia's secession vote, gathering thousands of demonstrators.
A group of masked pro-separates kept away from gendarmes bombed them with eggs and powdery paint, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that were usually flooded by tourists.
The fighting intensified later, the police using their rods to control the situation.
For a few hours, the pro-independence groups have been chanting "We don't forget, we don't forgive," while the unionists called out "Long live Spain!".
14 people received medical care for minor injuries caused during protests, according to the local press.
Tensions remain at a high level in the region wishing to become independent at one year after the referendum of 1 October was considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters have chosen to become independent in a strong majority, although participation in the vote has been low, and those against the secession have mostly boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 100 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop voting at the polling stations in the region, with violent fighting taking place.
Pro-independence groups camped over the night on Friday evening to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but protestors were forced to choose a new path.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer has hope for Catalonia's independence.
"Last year I lived some of the most beautiful moments of my life.
I watched my parents cry for joy that I can vote, but now we have nothing to do," he said.
Despite gaining a vital victory, but close, in the December regional elections last year, the Catalan pro-independent parties tried to maintain momentum this year, many of the most well-known leaders are either in exile or in detention, awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and declaring independence after.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded on his phone the protest in support of the police, said politicians on both sides fueled the conflict.
"The situation is getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in prison since the end of last year, announced that he will run for elections for the European Parliament next year.
"As a candidate for European elections is the best way to denounce the regression in the democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Several men were arrested after entering a house with their car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 years were arrested after a car entered a house in Londonderry several times.
The incident took place on Thursday, about 19:30, in Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said they were caused damage to the gates and even the building.
It seems that at one point a gun was used against the car.
Menga's kick helped the Livingston team win by 1-0 in front of the Rangers team
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston assured victory
Livingston left the Rangers team unrepeated, Steven Gerrard reaching the second defeat in 18 matches, as manager of the Iberian club.
Dolly Menga's kick turned out to make a difference while Gary Holt's team played the same level as Hibernian in the second round.
Gerard's team remains without a victory in the Premier League this season and faces the Hearts leaders, being behind them with eight points next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers hosts Rapid Vienna in Europe League Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston continues undefeated in division until six matches, Holt's main coach still feeling the taste of defeat because he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses his chance against cruel visitors
Holt's team should have gone ahead long before they signed up, and their orientation caused all sorts of problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to break in and try to hit the gates, then Alan Lithgow managed to kick out wide after he slipped in to intercept the ball sent with Craig Halkett's head.
The hosts were pleased to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could make visitors' problems at free shots.
And this was the way the crucial void came.
Rangers accepted a free shot, and Livingston succeeded in an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson collaborating to care for Menga, who sat and scored from the center of that.
At that stage, Rangers had dominated the possession, but he faced the impenetrable defense of the host, and porter Liam Kelly was no longer in great trouble in the rest of the game.
This game model continued in the second round, although Alfredo Morelos forced a defence from Kelly.
Scott Pittman didn't succeed at Allan McGregor from Rangers, and Lithgow hit a big shot from another Livingston team player.
The diagonal passages continued to come in which the Livingston team, but unsuccessful, and the two criminal requests - after Halkett shocked Glenn Middleton and after a bucket - were not accepted.
"Fenomenal game" offered by Livingston – analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena Stadium
A performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
They were excellent, without exception, continuing to exceed expectations on an ascending path.
Their playing style and team have not changed at all since their return to the top, but the merits must be given to Holt for the way he trained his team since he took over.
He had so many models to follow.
Captain Halkett was great, with excellent organized defense, while Menga put Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall into difficulty throughout the entire game.
But the Rangers weren't too inspired.
Although they have had good performance since they were driven by Gerrard, they have not reached the same standards.
The empty passes were failed, they managed only once to catch the gate of the free opponents, and this should be an alarm signal for Rangers, who is in the middle of the ranking.
Mixed reactions on Erdogan's visit to Köln
Everything was pink on Saturday (September 29th), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin to have breakfast.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to remedy relations between NATO allies.
They are unhappy about such issues as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's EU membership.
In this context, Erdogan went to Köln to open a new huge mosque.
The city hosts the largest number of Turkish citizens in the world outside Turkey.
The police have invoked security reasons to prevent the gathering of a crowd of 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but they have gathered enough supporters nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, most Kurds, heard his voice, condemning Erdogan's policies and the decision of the German government to welcome him with open arms in the country.
The contradictory protests reflect the division of a visitor considered to be a hero of some of the Turks in Germany and an autocrat of others.
Road accident in Deptford: a biker dies after the crash with a car
A biker died after a collision with a car in London.
The accident took place at the intersection between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a crowded street in Deptford, southeast of town around 10:15.
The car driver stopped, and the paramedics showed up at the accident site, but the man died on the spot.
The accident occurs only a few months after another biker died after an accident on Childers Street, where the driver fled from the scene, which is about a mile from the place where the accident occurred on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said officers are trying to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Access is restricted in that area, the route of buses is diverted, and motorcyclists have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured after a fight
Six prison officers were injured following a fight at a high-security prison for men, said a prison representative.
On Sunday, an HMP Long Martin match in Worcestershire began at approximately 9:30 p.m., being underway.
Specialized officers were brought in to deal with the fight, involving eight prisoners, isolated in a wing.
The officers were treated on site for minor injuries to the face.
One prison spokesman said: “The specialized prison staff was requested to deal with an incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members received medical care after they were injured.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we have very clear rules on those responsible, who will be transferred to the police and could spend a longer time after bars."
In HMP Long Lartin there are more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison governor needed hospital treatment after he was attacked by a prisoner.
And last year, in October, the disorder officers were called to prison to deal with a very serious situation, the staff being attacked with billiard balls.
Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City are in danger of being flooded because of Hurricane Rosa (dry areas can benefit from this)
There is rarely a tropical depression in Arizona, but this is quite likely to happen at the beginning of next week, because the remaining energy resources of Hurricane Rosa will be used in the south-west desert, with a risk of rapid flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued rapid flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in the western area of Arizona, south and east of the Nevada region, south-east California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will have a direct trajectory to Phoenix on Tuesday, and on the second part of the month it will cause precipitation.
The Phoenix National Weather Service announced in a Twitter message that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained a state of storm or tropical depression over a distance of about 320 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was an action hurricane approximately 60 km away from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Center for Uragane predict precipitation between 5 and 10 cm, with isolated quantities up to 15 cm in the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
In other areas of the south-west desert, including in the centre of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, quantities between 3 and 5 cm will be recorded, with total possible quantities up to 10 cm in isolated areas.
For regions outside the rapid flood risk, the rain brought by Rosa could be a blessing since the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, in certain areas, the torential rain will be beneficial as the south-west faces drought problems.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40% of Arizona is facing at least one severe drought, the second largest category respectively", information found onweather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will lead to landslides in the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, who still had hurricane power in the morning of Sunday, with a wind of up to 136 km per hour, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north, 19 km per hour.
The storm will meet cooler waters in the Pacific and will therefore decrease.
Thus, it is expected to produce landslides in Mexico, with tropical storm power in the afternoon or evening of Monday.
The torrential rains in Mexico could be significant, with a high flood risk.
"Torential rains between 8 and 10 cm" are expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, and can also reach 25 cm," saysweather.com.
Then Rosa will head north, in Mexico, as a tropical storm, before arriving at the Arizona border in the morning of Tuesday, as a tropical depression, passing through Arizona and arriving in southern Utah on Tuesday night.
“The main danger represented by Rosa or her remains is extreme torrencial rain from Baja California, northwestern Sonoră and the desert of the southwestern United States,” said a representative of the National Center for Uragane.
It is expected that these rains will produce sudden floods, which will endanger people's lives, and bring waste streams into deserts, as well as landslides in mountain areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four people arrested for attempted murder
Three adolescents and a 20-year-old man were arrested as a result of a suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with wounds caused by stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, Saturday, at approximately 4:00.
He was taken to the hospital, where he's in a stable state.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old and one 20-year-old were arrested last night in the Radstock area, according to the police in Avon and Somerset.
The officers requested the help of citizens who might have material on their mobile phone, respectively, to report to the police station.
Trump said Kavanaugh faced the Democratic Party's "favor and anger"
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump also said that Kavanaugh faced the Democratic Party's "favor and anger" during its nomination.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress, vehemently denying Christine Blasey Ford's assertions regarding sexual harassment ten years ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the meeting on her claim.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people saw Kavanaugh's genius, quality and courage on that day.
"A confirmation vote by Judge Kavanaugh is a confirmation vote for one of the best minds in the legal field of this generation," he said to the many supporters of West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to the nomination of Kavanaugh while talking about the importance of republican presence in intermediate elections.
“ We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
I don't run, but somehow run," he said.
"For this reason, I express everywhere my positive views on the candidates I consider outstanding."
Trump argued that the Democrats are on a mission to "resist and obstruct".
It is expected that the first key procedural vote in the Senate since the appointment of Kavanaugh will take place no later than Friday, said a GOP management assistant for CNN.
Hundreds of people killed by the earthquake in Indonesia, increasing
At least 384 people were killed, many of them being taken by the huge waves that hit the beaches, when a strong earthquake and tsunami struck the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, said the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered at a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves with a height of six meters hit the beach at dawn, people being taken by water and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was followed by an earthquake of 7.5 degrees magnitude.
"When the tsunami threat was issued yesterday, people still saw their activities on the beach and did not run immediately, thus becoming victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman for the BNPB disaster relief agency, at a press conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami itself brought cars, logs, houses, hitting everything on the land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the shore.
It added that some people had to climb the trees to escape the tsunami and survived.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The photographs published by the disaster agency feature several destroyed buildings and shops, overturned and collapsed bridges, as well as a water mosque.
Saturday, the replicas continued to rock the city on the coast.
The earthquake series was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) in Indonesia said that the energy emitted by the strong earthquake on Friday was approximately 200 times greater than the power of the Hiroshima atomic bomb in World War II.
The geographic structure of the city, which is at the end of a long and narrow Gulf, probably intensified the tsunami scale, added this representative.
Nugroho described the damage as "extended" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of victims were found trapped under the ruins of the collapsed buildings, he said, in addition to the 540 people injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said that the victims and damages could be greater along the coast 300 km north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications were “completely disturbed, without any information” in Donggala, Nugroho said.
There live more than 300,000 people," said the Red Cross, adding that its staff and volunteers are heading to the affected areas.
He added: “This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse.”
On Saturday, the agency was severely criticized for not informing that a tsunami would hit Palu, although the authorities said the waves arrived at the time of the warning.
In the posts on the social networks, a man on the upper floor of a building can be heard shouting frantic warnings that the tsunami is approaching people on the adjacent street.
Over a few minutes, a water wall hits the shore, taking buildings and cars with it.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the truthfulness of the material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power disruption, which blocked communications in Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate their rescue efforts.
The army began sending cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the evacuated people still need food and other basics.
The city airport was reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo planned a visit of the evacuation centres in Palu for Sunday.
The number of deaths caused by the tsunami in Indonesia is 800 people.
The situation is extremely serious.
As Word Vision staff from Donggala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where employees are housed in improvised shelters in the office yard, they passed by devastating scenes, Dosebah said.
He added: “They told me they saw many houses destroyed.”
The situation is very serious.
Even if aid groups began to initiate disaster relief actions, some people complained that foreign workers with comprehensive expertise were prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, financial resources, the delivery of materials and personnel can only reach the place of production of a disaster if declared a national disaster area.
This hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
"After the government says, "Yes, this is a national disaster," we can start international assistance actions, but nothing has been announced yet."
After the second night of the earthquake and tsunami in Palu on Friday, friends and families of missing people hoped their loved ones would be miraculously saved from such a national disaster.
Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of a channel.
On Sunday, the rescue staff released a woman who had been in ruins for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the national paragliding team, trained for the Asian Games, which ended early this month in Indonesia, two of the missing paragliding pilots.
Other prisoners at Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi, were his students.
"In view of the experience in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon told how, a few hours after the news about the collapse of Roa Roa hotel in the paragliding sports community, he sent desperate messages to WhatsApp contestants in Palu who participated in the festival organized on the beach.
But in the right of his messages there was only one gray beef, and not two blue beefs.
"I think that means that the messages have not been transmitted," he said.
A group of thieves stole $26,750 during the power of an ATM in Newport on the Levee
Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from an employee Brink who feeds an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car emptied an ATM from the entertainment complex and was preparing to transport more money, wrote Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
While he was busy, another man “ ran behind employee Brink” and stole a bag of money to be carried.
According to the communiqué, witnesses observed several suspects who fled from the scene, but the police did not mention the number of persons involved in the incident.
Any person who has information about their identity is requested to contact the Newport police at telephone number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes his stage name to "Ye"
Rapper Kanye West changes his stage name to "Ye".
He made Saturday's announcement on Twitter: "the official Kanye West."
West, aged 41, is called "Ye" for some time and uses this title as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
This change comes before his appearance at Saturday Night Live, where he expects to launch his new album, Yandhi.
It comes to the show in place of singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled "for emotional reasons", said the producer of the show.
In addition to the fact that it is an abbreviation for the current stage name, West previously said that this word also has religious significance for him.
"I think "ye" is the most often found word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you," said West earlier this year, in the discussion of the title of the Big Boy radio host album.
“So it’s you, I’m us, it’s about us.
Everything started from "Kanye", which means unique, and came to "Ye", this being a reflection on our good, bad, unclear things and the whole.
The album is more a reflection on what we are as people."
He's one of several rappers who chose to change his stage name.
Sean Combs had countless stage names, Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the name Love and Brother Love.
And a former West collaborator, JAY-Z, has changed his name, sometimes with a crayon, sometimes without, as well as with big letters.
The President of Mexico promises not to use military forces against civilians
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised that he would never use military forces against civilians, as he approached the country of the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza that “he will never use the army to suppress the Mexican people.”
The troops fired at a peaceful demonstration on the market on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when the left-hand movements of students were rooted in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to those studying and opening several free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
US should double funding for AI
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount it spends on research in the field, says Kai-Fu Lee, the investor and user of artificial intelligence, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments come after several members of the US government have made announcements about AI, even though in the US there is no official strategy for artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: it proposes to be the first in terms of AI innovation by 2030.
"The duplication of the AI research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the US and that we are looking for the next AI discovery," Lee said.
Doubling funds could double the chances that the next major IA achievement will be done in the US, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "Superpowers AI: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of the Innovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most prominent companies in China, Face ++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that defeated American player Othello, being the best in the field at the time, and later he was executive director at Microsoft Research and president of the Google branch in China.
Lee appreciated the previous competitions of American governments in the field of technology, such as Robotics Challenge of the Agency for Advanced Defence Research, and asked when to be next, to help identify the following visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government funds, Lee said.
"Not China puts beaks in the wheels of academic leaders, but corporations," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired remarkable graduates from universities to work at AI in recent years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could help the US step up its AI efforts.
"I think it should automatically be offered to doctors in AI," he said.
The State Council of China issued a New Artificial Intelligence Generation Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences in China provides financial support to people in academic institutions similar to the way the National Foundation for Science and other government organizations provide money for researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic activity is lower in China, Lee said.
At the beginning of the year, the Department of Defence of the United States set up a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence for the involvement of partners in the field and academics, and the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, the U.S. Army Research Institute (ARPA) announced a $2 billion investment for an initiative called "AI Next".
Also at this time, NSF invests more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
In the meantime, there have been no changes in the legislation of the United States aimed at setting up a National Security Commission in the field of artificial intelligence.
Macedonians will vote for the referendum if they want to change the country's name
On Sunday, Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum if they wanted the country's name to be changed to the "Northern Republic of Macedonia", a change that would resolve an old dispute with Greece, which opposed its accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which comprises a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the neighbouring country represents a claim on its territory and opposed its accession to the EU and NATO.
The two governments agreed in June on the proposed new name, but the opposition nationalists argue that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not vote in the referendum and that a boycott campaign doubted the presence of the vote, and that the minimum limit of 50% could not be reached, necessary for the validation of the referendum.
The question from the referendum ballot will be: "Do you agree with EU and NATO membership, accepting the agreement with Greece?".
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, state that it is a price to be paid by Macedonia, one of the countries that resulted from the overthrow of Yugoslavia, in order to be accepted in entities such as the EU and NATO.
"I am here today to vote for the future of the country, so that young people in Macedonia live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us," Olivera Georgijevska, 79 years old, told Skopje.
Although it is not legally mandatory, quite a few members of parliament have said they will respect the outcome of the vote in order to make it decisive.
For the name to be changed, a two-thirds quorum is required in parliament.
The state's election committee said there were no irregular reports until 1 p.m.
However, the participation was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66% of the voting people were put to the vote.
"We have come to the vote for my children and for our place in Europe," said a 62-year-old voter from Skopje, the capital of the country, Gjose Tanevski.
On 30 September 2018, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko voted for the referendum on the change of the name of Macedonia, which will allow him to join NATO and enter the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old, prepared a small stage and pulled seats in front of the tents raised by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with the top, not the back door," said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If we are not wanted by the name of Macedonia, we can go to other countries, such as China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian Union."
Prime Minister Zaev said accession to NATO would bring the necessary investments in Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I believe that most will be in favour of a change of name, because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of accession to NATO and the EU," Zaev said after he expressed his vote.
He said that one result in favour of changing the name would be "confirming our future."
According to a poll published last month by the Policy Research Institute, between 30% and 43% of voting citizens will participate in the referendum, under the required number of participants.
According to another survey conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote in favour of change.
For the referendum to be valid, the presence of the vote must be 50% plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to pro-vestic government policy since taking over the government last May.
Video: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City manages to cross the entire defense of the Brighton team and mark a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling managed to cross the defensive Brighton team and obtained Saturday the win of Manchester City with 2-0 at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
It seemed that Aguero was incredibly easy to mark in the 65th minute.
The Argentine attacker received a step in the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He moved very quickly among the three defensive players from Brighton before reaching the free side of the field.
Then Aguero woke up surrounded by four rival team players.
He managed to get past one defender, and then he overcame several adversarial players on the edge of the Brighton team.
After that, he took a left step, the balloon reaching Sterling.
The English attacker sent the balloon back to Aguero, who hit the ball with his right leg, able to avoid the doorkeeper at Brighton, Matthew Ryan, with a kick to the right side of the gate.
"Aguero faces a few foot problems," Pep Guardiola reporters, team manager Manchester City told them.
"We talked to him and we agreed to play 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he entered a void at that time."
But Sterling is the one who got their initial advantage for the Azurians at the Premier League game.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguaro got a deep step on the Brighton team's territory at that stage.
Then he gave a hand on Leroy Sane's left flank.
Sane dribbed the balloon a few times until he sent Sterling a pass, which sent it towards the gate.
The Azul attacker hit the balloon to the net right before heading out of the field.
Manchester City will meet with Hoffenheim in the group phase on Tuesday at 12:55 am on Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scarzer wants to do the damage in the game against Rockies
With the national team eliminated from the play-off competition, there were not too many reasons to force another start.
But Scherzer, being extremely competitive, hopes to win Sunday in the match against the Colorado Rockies team, but only if there are still implications in play-off for Rockies, who own an advantage with a game in the face of Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
Rockies got at least one unpredictable place, with a 5-2 victory against the national team on Friday night, but still trying to keep their first title of division.
"Even if we don't play for anything, at least we can enjoy the atmosphere here in Denver, next to the crowd, and the other team would probably play at the highest level of any point I could face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in these circumstances?"
The national team has not yet announced the player who will open the game on Sunday, but, according to sources, is inclined to let Scherzer take the first shot in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would be at the opening shot of the match with number 34, had a heating session on Thursday and will throw in normal conditions on this Sunday.
The Washington middleman has a score of 18-7 and an ERA of 2.53 and 300 installments in 220 and 2/3 matches this season.
Trump expresses support in West Virginia
The President referred to the situation regarding the Supreme Court’s decision as regards Brett Kavanaugh while speaking about the importance of republican presence in intermediate elections.
"All our efforts are at stake in November.
There are five more weeks to one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the big ones, not candidate, but actually candidate, that's why I try hard to support good candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “See this terrible, radical group of Democrats, see what is happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by using any means necessary, you can see their wickedness.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to crush to get power and control, that's what they want, to have power and control, and we won't give it."
He also said that Democrats are on a mission of "resistence and obstruction".
"And you can see that in the last four days," he also said, describing Democrats as "angry and evil, naughty and lying".
He referred to Senator Diane Feinstein of the Democratic Party and who is part of the Senate's Judicial Committee, who was strongly fled by the public.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you divulge the document?
What?
No. Hmm... I... wait a minute – that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party no longer tolerates people from a different point of view.
People who express their views are no longer tolerated
I was not surprised at the fact that the Momentum activists from my local party supported the motion of censure as far as I'm concerned.
After all, I am only one of the members of the Labour Party in Parliament who was told that they are not welcome, just because we have expressed our opinion.
Joan Ryan, my colleague in Parliament, received similar treatment because she was vehement in terms of antisemitism.
As far as I'm concerned, the motion of censure was a critic of my address because I disagreed with what Jeremy Corbyn said.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, similar problems ironically concerning which neither Jeremy had common views with previous leaders.
Communication for Friday's meeting in Nottingham East of the Labour Party noted that "we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive".
Most of the eight-year period as a member of Parliament for the Labour Party, the GC meetings of Friday evening were so.
Unfortunately, many meetings today do not take place in this way, and the promise of a "better, softer" political environment has long been forgotten if it has ever been respected.
It has become increasingly evident that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged according to what is accepted by the party's leadership.
Things started to be like this when Jeremy became a leader, when I noticed that some colleagues with whom we had a common vision of politics began to expect me to change my thinking and agree with some things that I would previously disagree with, including national security or the EU single market.
Every time I speak in public, no matter what I say, there is a wave of abuse on the dissocial networks that demand my elimination from the party, denouncing the policy of the centre, telling me I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And I'm not the only person facing this.
Indeed, I know that I am luckier than my colleagues, because comments about my person tend to be of a political nature.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face sexual or racist abuse, but maintain their level of involvement in this regard.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is that abuse has become a normal thing.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should adopt a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer accept different views within the party, and with each motion of censure or change of the selection rules, the party becomes less and less flexible on this issue.
Many people have recommended in the last two years that I put my head down, stop being so vocal, and everything will be "good" like this.
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, when I was a student, motivated by the fact that the negligence shown by the Thatcher government led to the collapse of my class, I wanted to fight for improved public services for those who needed them most, as a local adviser or minister.
I've never hidden my political opinions, including the last elections.
No person in Nottingham East can say that my views on politics and issues with which I disagree with the current leadership are unclear.
People who supported Friday's motion can only tell them that, in the context of the country's heading towards Brexit, which will affect our households, our businesses and our local services, I do not understand their desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But the only message I want to convey is not for the Momentum group in Nottingham, but for citizens, whether or not they are members of the Labour Party: I am proud to represent you and I promise you that no threat of elimination from the party or political opportunism will stop me from making the decisions that I consider to be in your best interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr football team reaches the top of the rankings
Despite the fact that two late attempts have somehow influenced the final outcome, there is no doubt that Ayr deserves to win today's extremely interactive match in Tennent's Premiership.
It's now in the top of the ranking, being the only team without any defeat of the ten.
Finally, it all came to terms with their better defenses, as well as taking advantage of the opportunities that emerged, which helped the host team and thanked Coach Peter Murchie.
"We have been subjected to more tests during our games so far and we continue to be invincible, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said: “The merits of the Ayr team have been given more opportunities than we have.”
The 14-minute trial of Grant Anderson, transformed by Frazier Climo, gave him an advantage of the Ayr team, but a yellow cartoonist received by Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who was able to join the team, he played Warriors, allowed the Melrose team to change their score, and Jason Baggot took advantage of an untransformed attempt.
Climo got a penalty for Ayr and, even in the middle of the game, managed to sign up, and then managed to turn an individual trial, and the score was 17-5 for Ayr at break.
But Melrose started the second very well, and Patrick Anderson's essay, transformed by Baggot, reduced the margin to five points.
The game was suspended for a few minutes because of the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, who was taken out of the field with the targa, and since the start of the game, Ayr was released through the trial of the player Stafford McDowall, transformed by Climo.
Captain of Team Ayr, Blair Macpherson then received a yellow cartoon and again, the Melrose team made the backup player pay with an unprocessed attempt by Bruce Colvine at the end of a severe pressure.
However, the host team recovered, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card because he plated Climo without a ball, MacPherson managed to mark, giving him the advantage of the Ayr team.
Climo transformed the trial, as he did again near the match's reboot, after Kyle Rowe executed a "box kick" move and sent Gregor Henry's extreme deep for the fifth attempt of the host team.
"Still Game" siteview seems ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Ford Kiernan, the website star "Still Game", seems ready to move to the hospitality industry after he learned that he was appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old man plays the role of Jack Jarvis in the beloved BBC show, writing his script and playing alongside his long-time partner, comedy actor Greg Hemphilll.
The two announced that the next series, the one with the number nine, would be the last, and it looks like Kieman is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the information in the official register, this is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this news, although a source from Scottish Sun suggested Kiernan wants to get involved in the "restaurant industry".
"The sea is ours": the island of Bolivia hopes the court will reopen its path to the Pacific
Sailors patrol a naval headquarters full of cranes in La Paz.
Public buildings are flying down the blue flag, like the ocean.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are covered with the motto: "The sea is our right.
We have to get it back."
Throughout Bolivia, which has no exit to the sea, the memory of a lost coast in Chile's face in a bloody conflict of resources from the 19th century is still alive – as is the desire to sail again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are probably at the highest level in recent decades, as Bolivia is awaiting a decision by the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the necessary momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, awaits the result with a positive vision," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the ICJ decision on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague court will give a ruling in favour of Bolivia's claim and that, after decades of firm discussions, Chile is obliged to negotiate the granting of a sovereign exit to the sea, Bolivia.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic president – who faces a controversial struggle for next year's reinstatement – also has much to gain from the month decision .
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts think it's unlikely that the court will decide in favour of Bolivia, and that there would be too little change if it happened.
The United Nations body in the Netherlands does not have the power to grant Chile's territory and stated that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the ICJ decision came only six months after the final pleas were heard indicates that this case "was not complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And not only did Bolivia not succeed in the cause, but it is possible that the last four years might have given it back.
"The problem of access to the sea has been diverted by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morales' belligerent rhetoric weakened any Chilean residual goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to speak at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to talk afterwards.
The two countries have never exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative at The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making process was unusually rapid.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end the 139 years of mutually beneficial disagreements," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of the most beloved presidents of Latin America – used the maritime problem as a political support.
"Bolivia will never give up the right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to see that we must pass through the past."
North Korea claims that nuclear disarmament will not take place if it cannot be trusted in the United States
Ri Yong Ho, North Korean Foreign Minister, said his country would never disarm its nuclear weapons if it couldn't trust Washington.
Ri spoke about this on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He asked the United States to keep its promises made during a summit in Singapore with rival leaders.
His comments come into the context that the Secretary of State of the United States, Mike Pompeo, seems to be about to resume diplomatic action on nuclear threat more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korean President Kim Jong One.
Ri said it is an "unreal vision" that the sanctions continue and the United States' objection to the declaration on the end of the Korean war ever cause northern territory to give way.
Washington is reluctant to agree with the statement without the Phenian taking significant disarmament measures first.
Both Kim and President of the United States, Donald Trump, want a second summit.
But there are many skeptics who do not believe that the Phenian has serious intentions to give up the arsenal that the country considers the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompei intends to visit the Phenian next month to prepare a second Kim-Trump summit.
A fashion presentation in Paris presents the latest trends in hats and will be available in stores soon
If you're looking for hats to extend your collection or protect completely from the sun, you don't have to look anymore.
Fashion creators Valentino and Thom Browne shocked participants at the Paris Fashion Week, launching a series of oversized and extravagant hats for their spring-summer 2019 collection.
The practical hats won the Instagram platform this summer, and the fashion creators sent out the creations that steal the podium's eyes.
The piece of resistance of the creation, made by Valentino, was an extravagant beige hat, with a wide bour, like a penis, in which the heads of the models sank.
Other oversized accessories have included beaded peppers, a witch hat and even a pineapple, but they are not designed to protect your head against the cold.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of weasel masks, in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had sewn lips and brought more of the accessories chosen by Hannibal Lecter, and did not fashion high couture.
One of the creations seemed to be a diving equipment, having an oxygen tube and glasses, while another seemed to be a melting ice cone.
And if you want to continue to adopt such a clothing style, with oversized clothing items, you're lucky.
Stylists predict a return of huge bonnets in luxury fashion stores.
The oversized hats return after the appearance of the hat "La Bomba", the straw hat with a wide bowl, seen all over the world, from Rihanna and to Emily Ratajkowski.
The return of the hat at all practical levels that appeared on all social networks caused the appearance of another oversized creation on the podium, respectively of straw people for the beach, with a size as large as the model in the bathing suit that wears it.
The orange bag of the rabies, with rabies fringes and a white leather handle, was the resistance piece of the spring-summer 2019 collection "La Riviera" of Jacquemus at the Fashion Week of Paris
The star stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: “I expect to see oversized hats and beach gangs in luxury stores next summer, because the fashion creator had such a powerful impact that it will be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Essential Language Skills for Global Citizens · Global Voices
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a record on academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional results at examinations, which is supported by individual and collective successes in sport, art, music and other Community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students from Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (CIS), strive to provide services at the highest level to students and their parents.
Independent schools propose to prepare their students for high school and higher education, their chosen career and their place as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a special school curriculum, we note that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, your words will reach his mind.
If you speak to him in his own language, words reach his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust people from other countries.
Based on the recent results of this year's competition, we note that foreign languages are at the top of the rankings, with the highest promotion rates in independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages obtained a Higher grade A certificate.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools have shown that 72% of students obtained a Higher grade A certificate in Mandarin; also 72% of those studying German, 69% of those studying French and 63% of those studying Spanish obtained such a certificate.
This demonstrates that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Now, foreign languages, as subjects, are held as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent curricula and in other fields.
A survey carried out by the British Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that for the reasons employers gave for the fight for vacancies, 17% were attributed to a language deficiency.
Therefore, linguistic skills are becoming increasingly imperative in preparing young people for their future career.
With several job opportunities requiring foreign languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future, having such ability throughout life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person before the competition.
According to a survey made by YouGov on over 4,000 adults in Britain in 2013, 75% were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, and the French language was the only language spoken by a two-digit, 15%.
This is why investment in foreign language learning is important for children today.
With more languages, especially in developing economies, children will have a better chance of finding significant jobs.
In Scotland, each school will teach other foreign languages.
One series of schools will focus on more modern classical languages, while others will learn languages that are considered to be the most important for the United Kingdom when they look forward to 2020, such as mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interest of your child, there will always be more languages of choice in independent schools, with educational frameworks that are specialized in this area.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and encourage them with the skills necessary to succeed, however it would be the future.
It cannot be denied at this time, in a global business environment, that languages continue to be vital for the future of the country, so that it must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should indeed be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
We have to do it properly (We must do it).
John Edward is director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will make the debut at Lakers Sunday in San Diego
Waiting is close to the end for fans who want to see it LeBron James how it starts for Los Angeles Lakers.
Team coach Lakers, Luke Walton, announced that James will play in opening Sunday's presence against the Denver Nuggets team in San Diego.
But how many minutes will he play remains to settle.
“It will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the official Lakers website.
Reporter Lakers, Mike Trudell, wrote on Twitter that James will probably play limited minutes.
Following the training since the beginning of this week, James was asked about his plans for the six-game Lakers program in the presison.
"In this stage of my career, I don't need games in the presison to prepare myself," he said.
The time of Trump's election rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts this evening a series of campaign meetings in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump's five meetings scheduled the following week, which includes stops in places where the electorate favors him, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the confirmation vote for the candidate chosen by him for the free seat of the Supreme Court is temporarily suspended, Trump wants to strengthen support for the future elections from the middle of the term, as Republicans risk losing control over Congress after the November vote.
What time will Trump's Western Virginia election meeting take place tonight and where can I track him online?
Trump's Wheeling Summit, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19:00, Eastern Coast time, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can track Trump's Western Virginia electoral rally online through the live video stream below, on YouTube.
Trump will probably discuss this week's hearing of Brett Kavanaugh, candidate for the Supreme Court, hearing that has become tense due to allegations of improper sexual behavior, while the Senate's expected confirmation vote is suspended for a week, so the FBI will investigate the charges.
But the main objective of this series of rallies is to help the Republicans, who face tough elections in November, win a little bit of land.
Thus, those of President Trump's campaign said that the role of these five next week's meetings is "energizing volunteers and supporters, while Republicans are trying to protect and extend the majority held in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so important to his program that the president will travel as many states as possible before entering the very crowded campaign season," said Reuters, a spokesman for Trump's campaign, who did not want to be named.
Scheduled to take place in Wesbanko Arena in Wheeling, this evening the rally could attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be presented in the media in Pittsburgh", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month when Trump visits West Virginia, the state where he won the election at a difference greater than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is being conducted in polls.
“The fact that the president came to try to propel him into the polls is not a good sign for Morrisey,” said Simon Haeder, a politician at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: US team gives proof of determination and continues to fight to maintain the chance for simple samples starting Sunday
After three distinctly dominated sessions, it is possible that the Saturday afternoon foursome test was exactly what the Ryder Cup needed.
The ever oscillating pendant of motivation is a concept invented for the world of sports, but players really believe in it, especially in the case of competitions like this.
So where is their motivation now?
"They were leading us with six points, now the difference is only four points, so we base ourselves on this drop for a little motivation," Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe still has the advantage, of course, with a four-point advance, when there are still twelve points at stake.
The Americans, says Spieth, feel that the game starts to change in their favor and that there are enough reasons for encouragement, of which the most important is the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and won each three out of four points.
Spieth sent the balls to the green area with a lethal precision, as an example for his colleagues.
Those guttural holiday screams became more and more loud as the advance round, especially when it entered a crucial point by which it brought the score back to equality in the fourth game, after he and Thomas had been led by two points after the first two holes.
The kick he won the match at 15 was celebrated with a similar scream, a scream that makes you think the American team still has a chance.
"You just have to concentrate and worry about just your own game," Spieth says.
There's so much left for these players.
18 holes to leave a good impression.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed revelation of the Ryder Cup.
The strange, but adorable couple of Europe won four out of four matches and apparently cannot fail.
"Moliwood" was the only pair who did not need any additional hits on Saturday afternoon, but this statement is valid for Saturday morning, and for Friday afternoon, even for the nine points on Friday morning.
This performance and how their energy appears to flow towards and from the enthusiastic audience reinforces the view that they will be the most dangerous players on Sunday. No other player would be more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari if they would ultimately lead to a potential victory of Europeans when the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably, both simultaneously, to different holes.
Discussions about the glory of Europeans remain premature for now.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly passed Sergio Garcia, the morning hero at the fourballs test, when he paired with Alex Noren.
An additional blow and two doubles to the first nine holes plunged the Spaniard and the Swede into such a deep pit that they were not even close to getting out of it.
Sunday, however, no one will be safe.
Fourballs and forsome tests are fascinating and deserve to be followed almost due to the interactions between pairs, given and undated advice and the way a strategy can be changed on-the-spot.
The Europeans have played better as a team so far and have a significant advantage on the final day, but this foursome session has shown that the US team has the motivation to continue fighting, which some, especially those in the United States, doubted.
Europe leads with 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe starts the last day of the Ryder Cup with a significant advantage after it has finished the fourballs and forsomes Saturday with a 10-6 advantage in front of the United States.
The inspired pair composed of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the offensive with two victories in front of a hesitant Tiger Woods, which has increased their score from now on at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, trying to win back the trophy he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated American players who made a lot of mistakes at the mid-morning fourball test and won the 3 to 1 score series.
The US opposed a more serious resistance to the foursome test, where it won two matches, but could not reduce the deficit.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points of the 12 simple Sunday games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novice to win four points in a row, and together with Molinari, a pair named "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, they are the second pair to win four points of the four opening matches throughout the history of the Ryder Cup.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed into the fourballs test, they were superbly supported to defeat the discouraged Woods and the American novices Bryson Dechambeau with an even clearer score, 5-4.
Woods, who had problems at the two matches on Saturday, had occasional flashes of genius, but so far he has lost 19 of the 29 matches at fourballs and foursomes, of which seven were consecutive defeats.
Justin Rose, who rested during the morning's fourball session, returned with partner Henrik Stenson in the forsome test and defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, positions one and three in the world.
Europe did not yet have a road without obstacles on this pleasant and refreshing day in southwestern Paris.
Jordan Spieth, triple winner of major tournaments, and Justin Thomas became the standard for Americans, winning two points on Saturday.
They managed to win a 2-1 match against the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs test, then came back later and defeated Poulter and Rory McIllroy with 4 to 3 in the foursomes test, after they lost the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has managed a team to recover a four-point deficit in simple evidence, though, because they are current trophy owners, Furyk's players only need an equal result.
However, after being in second place two days in a row, a Sunday counterattack seems unlikely.
North Korea states that there is no "opportunity" to disarm unilaterally as long as there is no trust
The Foreign Minister of North Korea said on Saturday the United Nations that the extension of sanctions would deeply undermine confidence in the United States and that it was impossible for his country to unilaterally renounce its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the General Assembly of the global council that "significant measures were implemented in North Korea to prove their good faith" last year, such as halting nuclear tests and missile testing, demolishing the location of nuclear testing and non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
“However, we do not see any appropriate answers from the US,” he said.
"If we can't trust the US, we won't trust our national security capabilities, and under such circumstances, we can't unilaterally disarm ourselves first."
Although Ri reiterated North Korea's family objections to Washington's opposition to a "scheduled" approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded if it took steps gradually, his statement seemed significant because it did not directly reject unilateral denuclearisation, as did the Phenian in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first-class summit between a US President and the leader of North Korea in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim committed to making progress towards a "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump provided guarantees on North Korea's security.
North Korea sought an official end of the Korean War in 1950-1953, but the United States said that the Phenian must first give up his nuclear weapons.
In addition, Washington did not pass the demands to relax the harsh international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
“SUA insists on the “first denuclearisation” option and increases pressure by sanctions to achieve its purpose in a coercive manner, even objecting to “the declaration of the end of the war”,” said Ri.
“The impression that sanctions can kneel is an illusion that only people who do not know us have.
But the problem is that prolonged sanctions deepen our distrust."
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump to which the US leader referred to the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-in, South Korea's president for the past five months, adding: "If the problem of denuclearization had been negotiated with South Korea and not with the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this impasse."
Even under these conditions, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from that of last year's speech, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target the US territory with missiles from North Korea after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "man-rake" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who had threatened North Korea last year with "total destruction," praised Kim for the courage to initiate the disarmament process, but specified that work is just beginning and that sanctions will remain valid until North Korea is denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said there is no planned period for this and added: "It doesn't matter if it lasts two or three years or five months."
China and Russia say that the Phenian should be rewarded by the UN Security Council for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday for the UN Security Council: “The implementation of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without interruption until we obtain complete, final and confirmed denuclearisation.”
The Security Council unanimously increased the sanctions imposed on North Korea since 2006, in an attempt to block funds for the Phenian's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompei met with Ri on the colours of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit the Phenian again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompei visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit did not work out very well.
When he left Phenian in July, he said that progress had been made, but only a few hours later, North Korea denounced the fact that he made "branster threats".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea undertook to dismantle a missile launch ramp and a nuclear complex if the United States took "appropriate measures".
He said Kim told him that the "appropriate measures" he was looking for were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and that he wants a normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take courses on how to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year encourages students to sleep more, in an attempt to combat growing “macho” culture that makes them subject to “all nightly” learning sessions, energized with a lot of caffeine.
A scientist has discovered that students of the world's most prestigious universities often do not even master the basic concepts of how they should take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is the one who created the course, which is believed to be the first of this type in the United States.
It was inspired to create a course after holding a conference on the impact of sleeplessness on the ability to learn.
“At the end, a girl came and said to me, ‘Why is this being said to me just now, in the last year?’
She told me that she had never been told about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," she said for The Telegraph.
The course, first introduced this year, explains to students the essential concepts of how good sleep habits help improve academic and athletic performance as well as general good status.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the university, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were seriously deprived of sleep during the week.
The course that lasts an hour may involve a number of interactive tasks.
Within a section the image of a bedroom is presented, and students can click on coffee canes, curtains, sports pants and cards to be told what the effects of caffeine and light are and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deficiency, but also about the importance of a sleep programme.
In another section, participants were told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive pictograms, encourages participants to think about their daily program.
“We know that we can’t change students’ behavior instantly.
But we believe that they have the right to know, just as anyone has the right to know what the effects of smoking on health are," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture that makes students proud that they have learned all night still exists, he says, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure imposed on students have turned sleep deprivation into a growing problem.
Sufficient sleep, of good quality, should be a "secret weapon" of a student to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, said this, even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deprivation makes the brain think that the body is hungry, which makes the students feel that they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California who studied chemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler create the course after he attended one of his courses in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to promote a course for all students.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all post-university students to complete a similar study program before entering this institution where competition is tight.
Professor Czeisler advised students to schedule an alarm to know when it is time to sleep, as well as for waking time, and to know what are the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LEDs, which can disturb the circadian rhythm and cause difficulty when they try to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal takes down Gerard's team
Rangers is suffering from another case of depression on the move because Dolly Menga's blow condemned Steven Gerard's unconvincing team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The team on Imbox wanted to win the first victory in the 4-1 victory in February against St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team succeeded in administering Gerrard's second victory in 18 coaching games, which puts Rangers eight points behind Hearts, the leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga signed up seven minutes before the break and the uninspired Rangers didn't seem to be equal at any time.
Rangers thus fell on the sixth position in the ranking, while Livingston climbed on the third place, behind Hibernian, to a difference of one goal.
And Rangers could face other problems as well, because the Calum Spence cough referee had to be treated for a head injury after an object was, it seems, thrown from the fan range of the visiting team.
Gerard changed eight players from the lot who won easily against Ayr in the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same 11 players from Livingstone who managed to get an equal with Hearts last week and has every reason to be proud of the way his well-trained lot suffocated their opponents during the match.
Even if Rangers had a superior possession, Livingston used the balls they had more effectively.
He should have scored only two minutes after the start of the game, when Menga's first step propelled Scott Pittman to the defense gate of Allan McGregor, but the middle missed a very good opportunity.
A deep shot of Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner, Alan Lithgow, sent her away.
Rangers took control, but they left the impression that more hope than they trusted in their game in the last third of the game.
Alfredo Morelos strongly believed that he should have received a penalty when he ran into Steven Lawless in the fifteenth minute of the game, but referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian request.
Rangers succeeded only two hits on the gate in the first rendezvous, but the former gatekeeper on Ibrax, Liam Kelly, was not disturbed by Lassana Coulibaly's head or by Ovie Ejaria's weak shot.
Although the 34th minute goal of the Livingstone did not respect the trend of the game, no one can deny that it was deserved, or only for the effort submitted.
Again, Rangers failed to prevent a deep Jacobs center.
Scott Arfield had no reaction when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his temper and cared for Menga, who ended up with a simple blow.
Gerard acted at the break, when he changed Ryan Kent to Coulibaly; this move almost gave fruit immediately, when the extreme focused on Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out of the goals to block him.
But Livingston continued to attract visitors in exactly the same kind of game he prefers, with Lithgow and Halkett intercepting center after center.
Holt's team could have extended its advantage in the final phases, but McGregor managed to block Jacobs' hit, then Lithgow sent headlong along the corner.
Glenn Middleton, reserved for Rangers, applied for a penalty towards the end of the game, when he hit Jacobs, but again Thomson disagreed.

And now, a page from our Sunday morning Almanah: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago (and counting CONTINUE...), is the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the creation of the device known as Geiger counter.
An essential device for science since then, the Geiger counter has also become essential for pop culture, as it happened in the film "The Clopots of San Coronado" (1950), in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played as cowboys with unscrupulous inclinations to science:
Man: "What else is this?"
Rogers: “It is a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you wear these helmets, you can hear the effects of atoms emitted by radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: “Yes, I hear a lot of punches!
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before he was 63 years old.
But the invention bearing his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "detect" harmful cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "detect" harmful cells and destroy them
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, their alteration in a laboratory
They can "detect" a common protein of many cancers and then are reinjected
A test vaccine provides promising results to patients with a range of cancers.
The ovarian cancer of a woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, their alteration in the laboratory so that they can "detect" a protein common to many cancers, called HER2, then reinject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Institute of Oncology in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we are dealing with a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "determines the growth of several types of cancers", including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, to extract immune cells from patients and to "learn" them to target cancer cells, has also worked to treat a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West held a Trump support diatribe while wearing a MAGA cap after the appearance at SNL.
He didn't get out too well.
Kanye West was chased into the studio during the Saturday Night Live show after a show in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he was planning to run for the 2020 elections.
After he played the third song, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a Make America Great hat, the artist broke out in a speech against the Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump.
“Many times when I talk to a white person, I’m asked, ‘How can you like Trump? Is he racist?’
Well, if I were worried about racism, I would have moved from America a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the show with a scene in which Matt Damon played, in which Hollywood star took over Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in front of the Senate's Judicial Committee on the charges of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcast, the video with West's diatriba was uploaded on social media by the comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to take West over with this post.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had backstage problems because of his boss.
"They tried to intimidate me behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go out wearing this hat."
I was attacked!
They told me I got very low," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see how low I got?" then said that "I'm going to get Superman's coat, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to evolve?
Try it with love."
His comments drew public hearings at least twice, and the members of the SNL team appeared to be embarrassed, reported Variety; one of this team said to the publication: "In the studio there was complete silence."
West was invited as a last-minute replacement for soloist Ariana Grande, whose boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West raised a lot of sparks when he played song I Love it dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
West was supported by the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “For one of our bravest spirits: Thank you for meeting the Globe.”
Karen Hunter, the host of a talk show, wrote on Twitter that West simply "was himself and that's great."
"But I choose not to reward someone (buying his music or clothing or supporting his "art") about which I believe he embraces and expresses a harmful ideology for my community.
He's free.
And so are we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he changed his name, announcing that from now on it is "the officially known child as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name; West runs after Diddy, formerly known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, took the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the former legend of the music, Prince, changed his name into a symbol and then in the "artist formerly known as Prince".
Accusation of attempted murder for a stab in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after another man was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhacklove, the police said.
The defence attorney is expected on Monday before the Court of Belfast.
The accusations will be analysed by the Public Prosecutor.
Kit Harington, the star in the Urzeala of the Thrones, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for Jon Snow's role in the series of violent medieval fantasy Urzeala Thrones, produced by HBO.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that the presentation of these roles on the screen makes the boys think it must be hard to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit told him that "something wrong happened" and wondered how the problem of toxic masculinity could be managed in the #Metoo era.
Kit, who recently married his colleague from Urzeala Tronii, recognized that she was "very determined" to talk about this problem.
"Personally, I am very determined to talk about it now: where did I wrong with masculinity?" he asked.
"What have we learned men about how to be as adults, given the problem we are now facing?"
Kit believes that television could be partly responsible for the growth of toxic masculinity by very male characters.
He continued: “What is born and what is learned?
What do young boys on TV and on the street learn, what makes them think there must be a certain type of man?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time: how can we change this?
Because it's clear that something wrong happened with young people."
In the interview, he admitted that he would not play any kind of series based on Urzeala Trons after the series ended next summer, saying that "he ended up with the battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will play in a new production of the True West theatre piece by Sam Shepard, which presents the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a carpenter.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that happened to him due to the Urzeala Throne series is that he met his wife, Rose.
"I met my wife when I did this series, so she assured me of the future of my family and my life from now on," Kit said.
Rose played in the role of Ygritte, girlfriend of Jon Snow, the character played by Kit in the fantasy series winning several Emmy awards.
The couple married in June 2018, on the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of Chinese citizens suffering from HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by this disease in China, say the officials.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases have been sexually transmitted, unlike in the past.
In the past, HIV has spread rapidly in some areas of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who have contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, say the Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan Province.
From one year to another, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is an acute problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is considered widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men will eventually marry a woman.
Many of the cases of transmission of diseases are due to inadequate sexual protection measures in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of its efforts to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee has disclosed the data to Republican Party senators, talks about "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theory"
The representative Maxine Waters filed charges Saturday that a member of his team posted personal information about three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democratic claimed that the charges are made by analysts and websites of "extreme right".
"Mincities, lies and other miserable lies," Waters said in a post on Twitter.
The information disclosed included Senators' personal addresses and phone numbers. Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
Information appeared online on Tuesday, posted by an unknown person from Capitol Hill during a hearing in the Senate on allegations of improper sexual behavior against Brett Kavanaugh, nominated as a judge at the Supreme Court.
The information leak took place shortly after the three senators asked Kavanaugh questions.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that IP address identifying the source of posts was associated with Waters' office and presented information to a Waters team member, Hill reported.
"These unfounded accusations are completely false, an absolute lie," Waters continued.
‘The member of the team, whose identity, personal information and safety were compromised as a result of these false accusations, was in no way responsible for the leaking of such information.
These unfounded accusations are completely false, an absolute lie."
Waters' statements were criticized online shortly after they were made, including by the former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is furious,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that he does not have the temperament needed to be a member of Congress.
When someone's accused of something they haven't done, they don't have to be angry.
He doesn't have to be suspicious.
The defendant must not be questioned.
It must be calm and quiet."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to that of Judge Kavanaugh, criticized by Democrats, who said he seemed a little too angry during the hearing on Tuesday.
Omar Navarro, the Republican running against Waters in mid-term elections, also commented on the situation on Twitter.
"Important, if it's true," he wrote.
In his statement, Waters said that her office warned “the appropriate legal authorities and entities about these false charges.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators will be discovered," she continued, "and they will respond to the law for all their destructive and dangerous actions for any of my team members."
Review Johnny English hits again: free parody of spy movies, with Rowan Atkinson in the main role
It has become a tradition of seeking meanings associated with Brexit in any new British film, but this does not apply to the new film in the series of parodys of action films that has Johnny English as its main character, the series that began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English is returning.
Will this zephemeral satire of how strange we are to become the new opportunity to export the nation?
However, Johnny English, the incompetent spy with blind eyes and rubber face, was renewed for the second time the license to ruin everything. The character's name means, first of all, that it is a general comic creation for the cinematographic public in English-speaking countries.
He is, of course, the broken secret agent who, despite his claims to luxury and extravagance, has a bit of Clouseau, a drop of Mr. Bean and a knife top of that type that contributed with only one note to the music theme of Chariots of Fire at the 2012 Olympic Games opening ceremony in London.
The character is based on the explorer and mysterious man without the country Atkinson once played in Barclaycard commercials for TV, which left chaos behind him.
This last adventure of JE has one or two nice moments.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor and the rotor's blades slightly hit his helmet.
The gift Atkinson has for physical comedy is highlighted, but humor is quite weak and strangely superfluous, especially because "serious" films, such as those in the 007 series or impossible Mission, confidently provide comic moments as an ingredient.
Humor seems to address more children than adults and for me, Johnny English's wild adventures are not as inventive and smart as Atkinson's silent movie gags when playing Bean's role.
As usual, the premise always is that Britain has serious problems.
A cyber-hacker infiltrated the supersecreted web network of British spies and revealed the identities of British undercover agents, towards the despair of the service agent, a regrettable small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last drop for a pompous Prime Minister and under siege, who is already suffering from a serious crisis due to the decline of political popularity: Emma Thompson does everything she can with his similar character Theresa May, but the scenario gives him no chance to shine.
Its intelligence advisors inform her that all active spies have been compromised, so they need to activate a reserve agent.
This is Johnny English's own zevzek, now working as a teacher in a high school, which gives lessons on how to be undercover. Here are some cute jugs, because English runs a spy academy in the School of Rock style.
English is brought back to Whitehall, for an emergency session, then is reunited with his former partner, Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a very enthusiastic and precious character, in which Vicki Pepperdine's talent is a little wasted.
So these Batman and Robin of creating the messes in His Majesty's Secret Service are returning to action, facing the beautiful mortal woman Ophelia Bulletova, interpreted by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls into the spell of a billion-dollar charismatic technology industry that claims that he can solve Britain's IT problems: the fatal Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start in an odyssey of burlestic adventures: disguised in waiters, set a fashion French restaurant on fire, create chaos when sneaking aboard Volta's luxury boat, then English triggers pure-shaped anarchy when they try to use a set of glasses for virtual reality to familiarize themselves with Volta's home.
This last sequence is very ambitious, but no matter what the cute and colorful film looks like a children's television production.
A pretty mediocre movie.
As in the case of other films with Johnny English, I can't stop asking myself: can the British film industry really not give Rowan Atkinson a role to measure his talent?
The workers deny that they plan to work four days a week, but to be paid for five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party would have a radical plan, according to which the British would only work four days a week, but would have been paid for five days.
It seems that the party wants the heads of companies to take advantage of the possible savings due to the artificial intelligence revolution (IA) giving employees another day off.
Thus, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but the salary would not have changed.
The sources say that the idea would be "matched" with the party's economic programme, which wants to tilt the balance in favour of the workers.
The shift to the four-day working week is supported by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way that workers can take advantage of changing the economy.
A source from Labour Party leadership said for The Sunday Times: “The policy review announcement is expected by the end of the year.
It did not happen overnight, but a four-day working week is an appropriate aspiration to approach the economy's rebalancing party in favour of the worker, as well as in the overall strategy of the industry party."
The Labour Party is not the first to support this idea; the four-day working week was one of the Green Party's promises in the 2017 campaign for the general election.
However, this aspiration is not supported by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "The four-day working week is not a party policy and is not taken into consideration by the party."
The Chancellor of the Shadow Cabinet, John McDonnell, took advantage of the Labour Conference last week to describe his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said it was decided to take back the power from "faceless" and "profit companies".
The plans of the Chancellor of the Shadow Cabinet also refer to the fact that current shareholders of the water supply kings may not recover their entire actions, because the Labour Government may perceive "deducts" due to reported offences.
It also confirmed plans to appoint workers in the board of directors of companies and to create property funds by which to transfer 10% of the private sector's own capital to employees, which will receive annual dividends of up to about 500 lire.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy reveal in the "60 Minutes" show if Kavanaugh's investigation by the FBI would make him change his mind
The FBI's investigation of the charges brought by Judge Brett Kavanaugh postponed the final vote on his candidacy as a judge in the Supreme Court for at least a week and raised the question whether Republican senators could be persuaded not to support him because of the FBI's findings.
In a Sunday interview, correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find information that would make him change his mind.
Kennedy seemed more willing to do this than his South Carolina colleague.
"Of course," Kennedy said.
"I said this from the beginning of the hearing; I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when this happened, when the charges came up and asked him, "Are you guilty?"
The answer was decided, prompt, unequivocal."
Graham's vote, however, seems to be dug in stone.
"I'm determined on Brett Kavanaugh, so we'd need some explosive charges," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett firmly rejects the charges," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“ None of the people she named confirmed the story.
And it happened 36 years ago.
I doubt if anything will change."
What is the Global Citizens' Festival and has it managed to do something to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen's Festival, an annual music event attended by an impressive group of stars, with an equally impressive mission: the elimination of world poverty.
After the seventh edition, the Global Citizen's Festival will attract tens of thousands of people on the Central Park, not only to track artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B or Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the true goal of the event, eliminating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens' Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting against it.
In order to receive a free ticket at the event (unless they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), spectators had to pay for a number of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending e-mails to world leaders, making phone calls or other significant things that help increase awareness of the goal of eliminating global poverty.
But what success has the Global Citizen Festival had when it's only 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is it the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a good way to convince them to act or is it just another case of so-called "clicktimism", a concept that refers to people who feel they have done something by signing an online petition or sending a message on Twitter?
According to Global Citizen, since 2011, more than 19 million “actions” have been registered by its supporters, who have promoted different objectives.
The organization says that these actions have driven world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than 37 billion dollars, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group was talking about 390 commitments and announcements caused by its actions, in which at least $10 billion had already been spent or raised.
The group estimates that the funds provided so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and intermediaries who have committed themselves to "help children grow up to their full potential", which promised to offer Rwande $35 million to help eliminate malnutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4700 Twitter messages from global citizens.
"With the help of the government of Great Britain, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make social injustice of malnutrition only become a note of basement in the history book," said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador The Power of Nutrition, in front of the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that, after more than 5,000 actions have been taken in Britain to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced that it will finance the project The Power of Nutrition, which will provide nutrition interventions for 5 million women and children.
The answer to one of the most frequent questions on their website: "What makes you think you can eliminate extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: “It will be a long and difficult road, sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like the great moves for civil or anti-apartheid rights that took place before us, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists who will sing at this year's New York event, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use naval forces for a "block" that makes Russian energy exports more difficult, says the Secretary of Internal Affairs
Washington may, if necessary, use naval forces to prevent Russian energy from reaching certain markets, including in the Middle East, have revealed US Secretary of Interior Ryan Zinke, quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke claims that Russia's commitment to Syria, especially where it acts at the legitimate government's invitation, is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason I am in the Middle East is that I want to intermediate the sale of energy, as I do in Eastern Europe and in southern Europe," he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and methods to manage the situation.
"The United States has the capacity, through our naval forces, to ensure that the sea routes are open and, if necessary, to create a blockade, so that energy does not go out on the market," he said.
Zinke addresses participants at an event hosted by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organisation that declares itself "the voice of the energy consumer" in the US.
It continued by comparing the way Washington interacts with Russia and Iran, showing that the approach is practically the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is, more or less, the use and replacement of fuels," he said, saying about Russia that "he knows one trick" because of the economy dependent on fossil fuels.
Statements come at a time when the Trump administration is trying to increase exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, to replace Russia, the much cheaper option for European consumers.
In this regard, representatives of Trump administration, including President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "indecided" North Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which, according to Trump, would transform Berlin into a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion project of the North Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the capacity of the existing pipeline, at 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin said that US fierce opposition to the project is driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we look at things the same way: energy cannot be an instrument that puts pressure on consumers and should be able to choose suppliers," said Aleksandr Novak, the minister of energy in Russia, after a meeting with Rick Perry, the US Energy Secretary in Moscow in September.
The US position attracted criticism from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main industrial organisation in Germany, Germany’s Federation of Industries (BDI), called on the US not to intervene in EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem with the fact that a third state intervenes in our energy issues," said Dieter Kempf, President of the German Federation of Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "thinks seriously" to run for the 2020 presidential elections, says the senator in Massachusetts
Elizabeth Warren, the senator in Massachusetts, said Saturday that he needs to "think seriously" if he can run for presidential elections after the mid-term election.
During the meeting at the City Hall of Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he considered an application.
"It's time for a woman to go to Washington and repair our broken governance, and for that it takes a strong woman," she said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I'll think seriously if I run for presidential elections."
Warren had something to say about President Donald Trump during the meeting at the city hall, saying that he "directed the country in the wrong direction".
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump does to our democracy," she said.
Warren was a very vocal critic of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate appointed by him for the Supreme Court.
In a message posted on Twitter Friday, Warren said "normal that we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that even the majority of Warren's voters do not think they should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "probable" Massachusetts voters said that the senator should not run, according to a poll conducted by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent of respondents support such an application.
The survey showed more support for a candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick: 38% of respondents support a potential candidacy of him and 48% are against him.
Other names of well-known Democrats who could run in 2020 are those of Vice President Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, Senator Vermont.
Biden said it would be officially decided by January, he reported Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about the post-traumatic stress syndrome Track Palin suffers at a Donald Trump rally.
Track Palin, aged 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
Monday night, he was arrested and charged in a case of domestic violence
"The things my own son passes through, through which he went through after his return... I can understand the suffering of other families who feel the ramifications of posttraumatic stress syndrome and the follow-up of wounds that our soldiers return to," said the public gathered at a support rally of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said that her son and other war veterans "turns a little different, harder, they come back wondering if there is further respect for what they and their soldiers in the armed and air forces, as well as all the other members of the Army, have done for the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman, preventing the reporting of an act of domestic violence and the possession of a gun in a state of drunkenness, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the police department in Wasilla.
18 states and District of Columbia contests a new asylum application policy
Eighteen states and District Columbia support a legal challenge to the new US policy refusing to grant asylum to victims who are trying to escape the violence caused by gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and District completed an amicus curiae request in Washington on Friday to support a challenge to asylum seekers policy, reports NBC News.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace v. Sessions process that the American Civil Liberties Union launched in August against federal policy was not revealed.
He said her partner "and his violent sons, members of a gang," abused her, but US officials rejected her asylum application on 20 July.
She was detained in Texas.
The state lawyer who represents Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produced a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, as nations facing a generalized problem with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy cancelled a 2014 decision of the Immigration Appeals Council that allowed immigrants without acts trying to escape domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Attorney General Karl Racine said Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation".
"The Federal Law says that all asylum applications must be judged on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such a limitation infringes this principle," writes the Amicus curiae application.
In addition, lawyers argue in the application that the policy refusing immigrants' entry affects the US economy, saying that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and 'provide the necessary labour force'.
Jeff Sessions, U.S. Attorney General, ordered in June judges for immigration cases to stop granting asylum to victims who are trying to escape abuse and gang violence.
“ Asylum is granted to those who leave their country driven by persecution or fear of discrimination on the basis of race, religion, nationality or membership of a social group or political opinion,” Sessions said on 11 June when he announced the policy.
The role of asylum has never been to solve all the problems that people face every day in the world, not even all the serious problems.
Desperate rescue operations in Palu, where the number of deaths doubled, in a race against timer to find survivors
For survivors, the situation has become more and more serious.
"The situation seems very tense," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother who aligns her baby suffering from fever at an evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
“Ambulances bring bodies all the time.
Drinking water is insufficient."
Residents began to return to their destroyed homes and organize their flooded goods, trying to save everything that can be saved.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale, were overcome by the situation.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered fractures in the spine and shoulder, rest outside the Palu military hospital, where patients are treated outdoors due to strong and continuous repetitions.
He has eyes full of tears when he remembers how he felt the violent earthquake shaking the hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
“ We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I was caught in the ruins of the wall, I believe," Haris told Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife scream for help, then just silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope I'm safe."
US Ambassador accuses China of “abuse” of “propaganda advertising”
A week after an official newspaper in China published a four-page advertisement in a US daily praising the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador to China accuses Beijing of using American press to distribute propaganda material.
US President Donald Trump referred to the supplement paid by China in Des Moines Register, the best-selling newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of mixing in the November 6 elections for Congress, an accusation that China rejects.
The accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the U.S. elections marked what US officials have said for Reuters that it is a new phase in a Washington escalation campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish ads promoting trade, Beijing and Washington are currently blocked in a growing trade war, involving increases in import tariffs.
The rates imposed by China as revenge, at the beginning of the commercial war, were created to affect exporters from such countries as Iowa, who supported Trump's Republican Party, said experts from China and the United States.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former governor in Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods in China, said Beijing hurt American workers, farmers and business people.
In a Sunday editorial published in Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote that China "continues this abuse by publishing propaganda advertisements in our own free press".
"When propaganda spreads through the publication of a commercial in Des Moines Register, the Chinese government does not respect the tradition of freedom of expression and free press in America," Branstad writes.
"In return, you will find few voices of the dissidents at the street newsstand here in Beijing and you will see no real reflection of the divergent views that Chinese citizens have about China's worrying economic trajectory, given that the media is under the control of the Chinese Communist Party," he writes.
He added that “one of the most important newspapers in China refused to publish” his article, although he did not say what paper it was about.
Republicans alienate female voters before mid-term elections due to Kavanaugh scandal, alert analysts
Because many of the top Republicans support and protect Brett Kavanaugh, nominated for the Supreme Court, on several charges of sexual abuse, analysts warned that there will be a counter-reaction, especially on the part of women, during the upcoming mid-term elections.
The emotions created by this scandal were extremely strong, and most Republicans who discussed it publicly intend to continue the vote.
"The response will not be forgotten," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, for The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he has doubts that Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute initiative on an FBI investigation will calm the angry electorate.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget tomorrow and they will not forget in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior consultant and national spokesman of the progressive group, according to Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "Come November!" as they demonstrated in the Senate halls when the Republicans who control the Judicial Committee chose to continue Kavanaugh's nomination process despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be very great," said Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst for the news site.
"People say they were already very big and that's true.
But it could be even bigger, especially among undecided female voters in the suburbs and the young electorate, between 18 and 29 years old, who, although they do not like the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which he detailed the allegations of sexual abuse brought to the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that it could follow a counter-reaction if Republicans continue the confirmation process.
"This turned into a mess for Republicans," said Michael Steele, former Chairman of the Republican National Committee at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not only about the vote in the committee or the final vote or the possibility of Kavanaugh being confirmed, but also about how the Republicans treated this situation and how they treated it,” said Guy Cecil, director of the US Priorities, an electoral support group of Democrats, for the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be relatively divided about the part that they should believe after Ford and Kavanaugh's testimonies: a little more seem to believe the latter.
A new survey carried out by YouGov shows that 41% of respondents strongly believe or think it's probably Ford's testimony was true, while 35% said that they strongly believe it or that Kavanaugh's testimony is likely to be true.
In addition, 38% said that Kavanaugh lied, probably or certainly, while only 30% said the same thing about Ford.
After Flake's initiative, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's allegations, as well as at least one other person, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Last week, Ford swore under oath before the Senate Judicial Committee that Kavanaugh abused her in a drunken state at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the nominee at the Supreme Court exhibited her genital organs in front of her while attending a party while they were students at Yale in the 1980s.
Inventor World Wide Web plans to set up a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a Solid based company, Berners-Lee's open-source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data are stored and who has the right to access the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is "global dominance".
"Now we have to do it," he said about startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data archives" or PODs.
It may contain lists of contacts, programs, calendars, music libraries or other personal and professional instruments.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify would all be available in one browser, all of a sudden.
What is unique about this online personal data archive is that the user has complete control over who can access this type of information.
The company calls this "personal data consolidation".
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea is that Inrupt will contribute with adequate resources, processes and skills, so that Solid will be available to everyone.
Currently, the company is composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a team of developers working on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change when their business models are completely upside down.
"We don't ask for permission."
In a Saturday post on Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that "the Inrupt mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of a new Solid Internet."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on Internet neutrality.
Even after Inrupt launches, Berners-Lee will remain founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this next era of the Internet,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The clergy who won the Victoria Cross in World War I are celebrating
The only clergyman of the Anglican Church who won a Victoria Cross medal as a fighter in World War I was celebrated in his hometown after 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won the medal on September 29, 1918 in the Bellenglise and Lehaukort attack.
He was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he was awarded the highest military honor of Britain.
A memorial stone was unveiled on Saturday by his two grandsons during the Rushden parade in Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "symbolized" that the stone would be revealed exactly 100 years after the fact that his grandfather won the medal.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Saint-Quentin Canal "with a very heavy fog and under the intense fire of artillery and machine guns".
Later, he rushed to the front line and, with "a fantastic bravery," opened the way for the soldiers, then attacked alone a nest of artillery and managed to eliminate three of the weapons of detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72 years old, said that his grandfather's actions were "a thing I know I will never be able to equal, but that makes me feel humbled."
This, along with his brother, Dr. James Vann, also filed a crown after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said that "he feels very honored to play a role in the parade" and added that "the value of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that many people give him."
The MMA fans stayed awake all night to see Bellator 206, but they got cartoons with Peppa Pig instead
Imagine that you've been up all night watching Bellator 206, an event with many stars, just to not be able to track the main event.
The San Jose event programme contained 13 struggles, including six on the main panel, and was to be broadcast live all night in Britain on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi was preparing to face Rory MacDonald, British spectators were amazed when the transmission was replaced with an episode of Peppa Pig.
Some were not satisfied at all because they stayed awake all night watching the fight.
A fan described on Twitter the move to the cartoon for children as "a kind of stupid joke."
"Government regulations say this content is not suitable for 6 a.m., so they had to change to children's programs," said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President of the Bellator for marketing and communication, when asked about the transmission.
"Peppa Pig, yes."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator company, said that in the future they would program their events in such a way that they could be followed by spectators from Britain.
“When I think about replays, I think we could probably figure it out,” Coker said.
"But it's six in the morning on a Sunday here and we won't be able to do this until Sunday, our time, or Monday, their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed, I started getting a lot of text messages and they weren't all friendly.
We tried to solve the situation, I thought it was a technical mess.
But it wasn't about that, it was about government regulation.
I can promise you it won't happen next time.
We'll sum up five fights instead of six, as we usually do. We tried to offer fans more and we crossed the line.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "low" because of sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling that everyone is inferior because of his sexuality, but this motivated him to succeed.
24-year-old sportsman said he only realized when he arrived at school that "not everyone is like me."
Invited to the first Desert Island Discs show presented by Lauren Laverne, on Radio 4, he said he talks about gay people's rights to give them hope.
The sportsman also said that when he became a parent, he cared less about the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the usual presentation of the traditional show, will be missing a few months because of a disease.
Invited to the first edition presented by Laverne, Daley said that when I was a child, I felt "under" to others because "it was socially unacceptable for me to like boys and girls."
He said: “To date, these feelings of inferiority and feeling different were the real things that gave me strength and resistance to gain success.”
He wanted to prove he's "someone," he said, so don't let everyone down when they finally find out about his sexuality.
The winner of two bronze medals at the Olympics has become a renowned supporter of LGBT campaigns and has taken advantage of the appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to demand several countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he decided to speak because he felt lucky that he could live free, without a trace, and because he wanted to give hope to others.
The triple world champion said that "he was taken by surprise" by the fact that he fell in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black.
Daley married last year to Oscar's winning filmmaker, who is 20 years older than he, but said that age difference was never a problem.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" - he participated in the first Olympics when he was only 14 years old, and his father died of cancer after three years - he said, it's hard to find someone of the same age who had been through the same good and bad moments.
The two became, in June, the parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, which, says Daley, changed "the whole perspective".
"If I had been asked last year, I would have been interested only in winning a gold medal," he said.
“You know what? There are more important things than the gold medals at the Olympics.
My Olympic Gold Medal is Robbie."
His son bears the name of his father, Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40, after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die and that one of the last things he wanted was to find out if he had received tickets for the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to be first.
"I couldn't say "you won't be able to be first, Dad," he said.
“I held him by my hand when he stopped breathing and only after he had no breath and died did I finally accept that he was not invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze medal.
“I knew that this was what I dreamed of a lifetime, to jump in front of the spectators in my country to the Olympic Games, there is no more beautiful feeling,” he said.
This inspired him also in the chosen music, Proud of Heather Small, songs that encouraged him before the Olympics and still thrills him.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15.
Mickelson, out of shape, was passed on the reserve bank Saturday, in the Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Saturday, when he's playing in the forty-seven games in the Ryder Cup, but he'll have to get back to a good shape so it won't be an unfortunate occasion.
Mickelson, who plays at the two-year event for the twelfth time, another record, was passed on Captain Jim Furyk's reserve bank for fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the heart of the action, as it has often been for the United States team, the win-win round divided the day between being a cheerleader for teammates and exercising their shots, hoping that it will correct what was wrong.
The 48-year-old player never had the rightest drives, not even in the best time of his career, so it's not the best choice for the narrow land of Le Golf National, where long areas of rush often punish wrong hits.
And if the field is not a challenge enough for the sea, in the ninth Sunday game Mickelson will face Francesco Molinari, the meticulous British Open champion, who joined the novice Tommy Fleetwood and won all four matches of the week.
Mickelson's match could prove absolutely crucial for Americans, led by four points at the entrance to the 12 simple matches, which must start in force at this stage.
Furyk said he was confident in his player's ability, but he couldn't have said anything else anyway.
"He fully understood the role he played today, beat me on the shoulder, hugged me, and told me that he would be ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has made a significant contribution to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't imagine he was going to play in two games.
I imagined more, but that's what happened, and that's how we thought we had to proceed.
He wants to play like everyone else."
Sunday, Mickelson will exceed Nick Faldo's record for most games played in the Ryder Cup.
This could be the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, which has not risen to the level of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 winning matches, 20 lost and seven half, although Furyk said his presence has brought some intangible benefits to the team.
"It's funny, it's sarcastic, smart, he likes to joke with the players, he's a great guy in the team locker," he explained.
"I think young players are having fun joking with him, it was fun to see them do that during the week.
His role is more important, it's not just about playing."
The captain of the European team, Thomas Bjorn, knows that the considerable advance could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the Europeans, knows from experience that the considerable advance held before the first day of the simple tests in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable journey.
The Danish debuted at the 1997 Valderrama match, when the team led by Captain Sive Ballesteros led the Americans with five points, but only if he managed to defeat them with a minimum difference, from 1411⁄2 to 1311⁄2.
“I remind myself that we had a considerable advance at Valderrama; we had a big advance at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we barely won,” Bjorn said after following the 2018 team, which won 5-3, both Friday and yesterday, and now leads 10-6 on Le Golf National.
"So history shows me, me and my team, that it's not ready yet.
Tomorrow we have to play the maximum tournament.
Let's get out on the ground and do everything perfectly.
The game is only ready after the points are passed on the table.
We have a goal and this is to win this trophy, it must remain the goal.
We always said, we have to focus on the 12 players in our team, but we know what we expect on the other side: the best players in the world."
Delighted at the way his players managed on a difficult field, Bjorn added: “I’m not in a hurry to draw conclusions.
Tomorrow's a different situation.
Tomorrow are important individual performance, and this is different.
It's wonderful to be on the field with a partner when things go well, but when you're on your own, then you're tested to the fullest, as a golfer.
This is the message you have to convey to the players, that it must be in the best shape tomorrow.
Now they leave their partner behind and they have to play as well as they can."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk, captain of the opposing team, hopes his players will play better at the simple test than they did with partners except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself was on both sides of such returns on the last day: he was on the winning team at Brookline, then on the losing one when Europe succeeded the "miracle at Medina".
"I remember every word," he answered when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, had succeeded in encouraging his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow and we would like to start with some quick victories, like at Brookline, like at Medina.
When inertia develops in a direction, put a lot of pressure on those midgames.
We created the right lot and ordered players as we would like, you know, we try to create a little magic tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned the task of leading the fight: he will face Rory McIllroy in the main match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the second half of the program.
"I chose this group of players, in this order, because I think it covers all the subjects," Bjorn said about the lot for the simple test.
Germany's new warship, postponed again
Germany's newest fleet of naval forces should have been put into operation in 2014 to replace the old warships of the Cold War, but this will only happen once a year, due to failing systems and rising costs, the local press reported.
The entry into service of the "Rheinland-Pfalz" ship, the stendard ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg frigate class, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit, which quotes a military spokesman.
The vessel should have been introduced into the maritime forces in 2014, but problems arising after delivery affected this ambitious project.
The four vessels in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class that the Military Navy ordered in 2007 will replace the old dishes in the Bremen class.
They are supposed to be fitted with a strong cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-vas missiles, as well as stealth technologies, which provide a reduced radar, infrared and acoustic print.
Other important features will include longer maintenance periods; it should be possible for new frigates to be able to leave for two years without returning to their original port.
However, continuous delays mean that these last generation warships, which are said to increase Germany's maritime force, will already be aged before entering service, notes Die Zeit.
F125 was discussed in the press last year, when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship and returned it to the ship yard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a construction vessel after delivery.
Not much information is available on the reasons for the refusal, but the German media has cited a number of crucial "software and hardware defects" that would have made the warship useless in a combat mission.
The software defects were especially important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessels will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, only half of the crews on the oldest frigates in the Bremen class.
In addition, it has proved that the vessel was too heavy, which reduced its performance and limited the military's ability to add future equipment.
It is believed that the 7,000-tonne vessel "Rheinland-Pfalz" is twice as hard as the vessels used by Germans in World War II.
In addition to the default mechanisms, and the price of the entire project, including the training of the crew, has become a cause for concern.
It is said to have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) from the initial price of 2.2 billion euros.
The problems of the newer frigates are of particular importance in view of the latest warnings that say Germany's maritime power is falling.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defense committee in the German parliament, acknowledged that the Military Navy "has begun to run out of vessels that can be sent to missions".
The official said that the problem has grown steadily over time because the old vessels were removed from operation without being replaced with some new ones.
It deplored the fact that none of the sinks in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class had entered into operation in the Military Navy.
National Trust spies on the secret life of bats
New researches that are carried out on a property of Scottish Highlands want to reveal how they use the environment to hunt their prey.
It is hoped that discoveries will reveal new things about the behavior of these unique flying mammals and will help future conservation activities.
The study carried out by scientists of the National Trust for Scotland will analyze common dwarf bats and pygmy bats, as well as ear bats and water bats in the Inverew Gardens of Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be located in key locations around the property to track bat activity throughout the season.
The NHS team and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using manual detectors.
Specialised audio analysis of all recordings will estimate the frequency of bat sounds and how species emit certain sounds.
They will be produced and a map of habitat and a report, to create a detailed, scaled picture of their behavior in the environment.
Rob Dewar, a consultant on nature conservation for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which habitat areas are the most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of grass, and which is the best way to maintain forest pastures for bats and other associated species.
The bat populations in Scotland and throughout Britain have declined considerably in the last century.
These are endangered by construction and development work that affects their nests, but also habitat loss.
And wind turbines and public lighting are risks, as are flies traps and some chemical treatments for building materials, but also attacks by domestic cats.
Actually, bats aren't blind.
However, because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated greening technique to accurately identify insects and obstacles on their flight route.
NTS, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major parks and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, is very serious about bats.
They have ten trained experts who regularly conduct studies, control nests and sometimes perform rescue missions.
The organization created even the first and only reserve of bats in Scotland, on the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of the ten bat species in Scotland are found.
The manager of the estate, David Thompson, says this is the ideal territory for bats.
"Here, in Three, the area is wonderful for bats," he says.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and a perfect habitat.
But there are many things we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us understand why they need to multiply."
It underlines the importance of looking for bats before carrying out maintenance work on property, as simply unintentional destruction of a mother nest could kill up to 400 females and chickens, which can destroy the entire local population.
Lilies are protected, and killing, harassing or disturbing them, as well as destroying their nests, are prohibited actions.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official at the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help them.
He said: “We still have a lot to learn about bats and we don’t know how populations evolve for many of our species.”
Ronaldo denies charges of rape while lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo said the charges against him are "fake news" and that some people "want to advertise" using his name.
His lawyers are determined to sue German magazine Der Spiegel, who published the charges.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus team was accused of raping a woman from America, identified as Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported Friday that the footballer paid her $375,000 not to talk about the incident.
A few hours after the accusations were published, in a video broadcast on Instagram Live for its 142 million followers, Ronaldo, aged 33, said they are ‘fake news’.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today are fake news," said the winner of the Golden Ball in front of the video camera.
“I want to advertise using my name.
It's normal.
They want to get famous using my name, but I'm used to it.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," added the player, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel on account of these charges, which they called "an inadmissible report of suspicions that hold private life," according to Reuters.
Advocate Christian Schertz says that the player will ask for compensation for "moral damage equivalent to an adequate amount for the seriousness of the act, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
The alleged accident would have taken place in June 2009 in an apartment at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a club, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he raped her anal, according to documents filed at the District Court of Clark County in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that, after the incident, Ronaldo fell on his knees in front of her and told her that he was "a good boy" in proportion to "99%", and that he was betrayed by that "a percentage".
The document claims that Ronaldo confirmed that he had sexual relations with the accuser, but that they were consensual.
Majorga claims that he addressed the police and that the photographs of her injuries were taken at the hospital, but subsequently accepted an agreement outside the courtroom because she was "terrorized by the possibility of revenge" and was worried that she would "be humiliated publicly".
The 34-year-old woman now seeks to cancel that understanding because she continues to be traumatized by the incident.
At the time of the attack he was accused, Ronaldo was about to transfer from Manchester United to Real Madrid. This summer, he was transferred to the Italian giant Juventus, after a transaction worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: United Kingdom “would regret forever” loss of car manufacturers
Great Britain would "repair forever" if it lost the status of world leader in automotive production after Brexit," said the Secretary for Greg Clark.
He added that it is "worried" that Toyota UK said for BBC that, if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, it will temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston near Derby.
"We need an agreement," Clark said.
The Japanese auto producer said that the impact of border delays on a Brexit without agreement could cost jobs.
The Burnaston factory, where the brands Auris and Avensis of Toyota are manufactured, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production will stop in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's executive director in Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, said they are afraid of leaving the EU without an agreement on cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, says that after Brexit, it will close the factory in Oxford where the Mini model is produced for a month.
The main concerns are created by what producers call risks associated with the supply chain in the case of a Brexit without agreement.
Toyota's production line works on the basis of the time-fix principle: for machines manufactured at command, the parts arrive at 37-minute intervals from suppliers in Britain and the EU.
If Britain leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, problems may arise at the border, which, according to industrial producers, could lead to delays and a deficit of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to deposit more of the inventory for a day at his factory in Derbyshire, says the company, so production would be stopped.
Clark said that the Chequers plan of Theresa May for future EU relations is "precisely calibrated to avoid these delays at the border".
"There must be an agreement. We want to have the best agreement, which will allow us not only to enjoy the success of today, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," he said for BBC Radio 4's Today show.
"The evidence from not only Toyota, but also other producers shows that we must continue to use what was a very successful supply chain set."
Toyota could not specify how long production will have to be stopped, but warned that increased prices could reduce the competitive capacity of the long-term factory and ultimately lead to job loss.
Peter Tsouvalaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is the head of the United Union trade union at the factory, said that members are increasingly concerned: "Experience has taught me that after I disappear these jobs are not coming back."
A government spokesman said: "We have created a precise and credible plan for the future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, says the White House.
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "adjourned another week," because the battle for Brett Kavanaugh, nominated at the Supreme Court, continues, White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees special adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in elections, links between Trump's aid to Russia and potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Rumors of Trump's possibility of firing the Deputy Attorney General, thus endangering Mueller's independence, have circulated in Washington's circles for months.
Early in the month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing a microphone to record talks with Trump and the possibility of suspending the president through Amendment 25 to the U.S. Constitution.
Rosenstein denied this report.
But last month he went to the White House, and reports say he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced for Thursday at the United Nations headquarters in New York.
Trump said he would rather not fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a conflict with the hearing of the Senate's legal committee, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
Friday, Trump requested a week-long FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, which once again postponed the Senate plenary vote.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders showed up at Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: “Not once has been established in this regard, it may be this week or it may be a week, taking into account all the other things now taking place in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and always like to keep the press up to date."
Some reporters would challenge this claim: Sanders had no press briefing at the White House on September 10th.
The host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the reduction in the number of briefings was not caused by antipathy against TV reporters who liked to play, although he added: “I don’t deny that they like to perform.”
Then he suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased.
"The President participates in more questions and answers than all previous presidents," she said, adding without mentioning any evidence: "I have analyzed the figures."
"There will be briefings," Sanders said, "but it is much better for the press to have the opportunity to direct its questions to the President of the United States, not to me.
We're trying to do this most of the time and you could see that we've done this many times in recent weeks, and discussions with the president of the United States will replace press briefings when it's available."
Trump usually answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with the dignitaries who visit him.
The press conferences granted exclusively by him are rare.
This week in New York, the president demonstrated why this is happening, having an improvised appearance, on bizarre locations, in front of the reporters assembled.
A State Secretary of the Ministry of Health is addressed in a letter to EU employees from the National Health Service (NHS) of Scotland on concerns related to Brexit
The State Secretary wrote to EU employees working at the Scotland NHS branch to express their gratitude on behalf of the country and their desire to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Parliament of Scotland, sent the letter under conditions of less than six months until the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
The Scottish government has already made a commitment to bear the costs for applications to receive permanent residence status for EU citizens working in decentralized public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on withdrawal continued, waiting for decisions to be taken this autumn.
However, the United Kingdom government has begun to prepare itself more and more for a different scenario, in which there would be no agreement to leave the EU.
I know it's a very stressful time for you.
For this reason, I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each employee, regardless of nationality.
Members of the European Union, but also outside it, have valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the activity of the health service and also bring benefits to the patients and communities we serve.
You can consider Scotland your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after having suffered a head blow
The founder of Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, was subjected to an emergency surgery after having suffered a head shot on Saturday, in the game his team lost in front of the Vanderbilt Commodores team, with a score of 31-27, told Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Senior coach of the Tennessee State team, Rod Reed, told reporters that the hit took place shortly before the break.
"It reached the cough line and just collapsed," Reed said.
Abercrombie's oxygen mask was placed by the physical preparations and medical personnel, on the cough line, before sitting on a tarp and transporting it off the ground for a detailed assessment.
A representative from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie left the operation to which he was submitted at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are still no details of the type/widening of the accident" and that Tennessee States is trying to figure out when it occurred.
Abercrombie, a student in the year 2, is in his first season in Tennessee State after he moved from Illinois.
Saturday, he managed to make five total bandages before leaving the game, reaching a number of 18 plates throughout the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp judicial fee when buying a property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will pay a higher stamp tax on the purchase of a property in the United Kingdom, and additional money will be used to help homeless people, according to the new plans of the Conservative Party
This change will neutralize Corbyn's success in attracting young people with the right to vote
Judicial stamp fee will be applied to persons who are not paying taxes and taxes in the United Kingdom
Treasury is expected to raise up to £120 million a year to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will apply a higher rate of stamp judicial fee to purchase a property in the United Kingdom, and additional money will be used to help homeless people, as announced today by Theresa May.
The change will be considered an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn's successful efforts to attract young people with the right to vote, promising more expensive homes and targeting people with higher incomes.
The higher tax on stamps will be applied to natural and legal persons who are not paying taxes and taxes in the United Kingdom, and the additional money obtained thus will be used to support government efforts to help homeless people.
The surplus, which adds to the current tax on stamps, including the high levels two years ago for the second property and properties purchased for rent, could reach a value of 3%.
The Treasury expects this change to bring up to £120 million a year.
About 13% of new properties built in London are purchased by non-residents in the United Kingdom, which leads to price increases and makes it difficult for those who want to buy their first home.
Several prosperous areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost cities" because of the high number of foreign buyers spending much of their time outside the country.
The new policy has only come a few weeks since Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the tax on stamps to help young people buy their first home.
He accused the large construction companies of maintaining high prices on property as a result of the acquisition of land without using them and asked Thersa May to waive the fees for affordable houses, with a view to solving the UK 'home problem'.
Corbyn has announced a number of proposals for attractive real estate reforms, including rent controls and the cessation of unmotivated evacuations.
It also wishes to provide the Councils with greater powers in terms of building new houses.
Theresa May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my prime mandate to the fulfillment of the British dream, a better life for every new generation.
And that means to remedy the problems in the real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not fair for people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as companies with headquarters abroad, to be able to buy homes as easily as British residents who work hard.
For too many people, the dream of owning a house has become one too far away, and living in unworthy conditions is too real."
Jack Ross: "My final goal is to be the manager of Scotland's national team"
Jack Ross, the manager of the Sunderland football team, said that "his final goal" is to become, at some point, the manager of Scotland's national team.
The 42-year-old Scotsman enjoys the challenge of "reviving" the Northeast Club, which is currently in place 3 in the First League, with a three-point difference from the first place.
He moved this summer to the Light Stadium team after he succeeded, last season, the return of the St. Mirren football team to the first Scottish Premiership division.
"I wanted to be a member of the national football team, but as a player.
We arrived on the B team of the national and about that," Ross told the BBC of Scotland for Sportsound.
"But I spent a lot of my childhood watching Scotland's matches at Hampden with my father and I always wanted to come back.
But I will only take this opportunity if I succeed as the club manager."
Ross' predecessors, as managers of the Sunderland Club, include Dick Advvocat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of the Alloa Athletic club said he has no emotions to be the successor of such consecrated names and to such an important club after he refused offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The only thing that concerns me and that could affect my success is the question "Can I help this team get back into the Premier League?"
There is no doubt that the structure and facilities in this club allow it to be in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to make her get there, but I think the only thing that would make me feel like a successful man is to contribute to the return of the club to the Premier League."
Ross has only three years of experience in leadership, after a time when he was assistant manager at Dumbarton and another 15 months spent as a member of the Hearts training staff.
Then he helped the Alloa club recover after it regraded into division C and managed to save St. Mirren from retrograde, helping the team win the title of the champion in the next season.
Ross said he feels better now than in his entire career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was a turning point," he said about taking over the Alloa club.
“I really thought my role as manager was more appropriate than the role of the player.
Maybe it sounds weird, because we had a good time, we win well and we had a few successful moments.
But it's hard to be a player.
You have to do a lot of things and repeat them weekly.
I face similar situations as a manager, with regard to stress and pressure, but I feel that it is the right role for me.
I've always wanted to be a manager and now, that I can do this, I feel that it's the thing that fits me best in my entire adult life."
You can listen to the entire interview on Sunday, 30 September, between 12:00 and 13:00 at the Sportsound show at Radio Scotland.
The ideal time to drink a beer broth is Saturday at 5:30 p.m., according to a survey
The heat wave this summer led to an increase in income in UK pubs, but putting more pressure on restaurants chains.
According to figures, pubs and bars recorded an increase of 2.7% in July, while restaurant revenues fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, the representative of the CGA company that provides business advisory services and carried out the survey, said: “The constant warming and participation of England in the World Cup over a longer period than expected contributed to a printing press in July, similar to the one in the previous month, when pubs registered with up to 2.8% more customers, while restaurants had a worse period.
The number of customers below 1.8 percent in the June restaurant industry declined even more in July.
Pubs and bars serving only drinks have recorded a much higher profit than restaurants.
And food-service pubs have recorded heat losses, but not as large as restaurants.
Looks like people just went out to town to eat drinks.
Drink sales at all bars and pubs grew by 6.6% this month, and food fell by 3%."
Paul Newman, the representative of the RSM company offering services in the hospitality industry, said: “These results continue the trend we have observed since the end of April.
The weather conditions and the impact of sport and large social events remain among the most important factors contributing to sales associated with the OOH advertising market.
It is no wonder that restaurants continue to record losses, although the decline in sales by 4.8% year will be added to current pressures on costs.
In the summer the canicular could not come at a worse time for food industry operators and only time will decide whether the more moderate temperatures recorded in August will bring better news."
The increase in total sales of pubs and restaurants, including new ones, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the reduced number of new locations launched.
The company that monitors sales of UK pubs, bars and restaurants, Coffer Peach Tracker, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined profit of over £9 billion, which is the official standard in the industrial sector.
One of five children has a secret account on a social network hidden by parents
According to a survey, one of five children, some even up to 11 years old, has a secret account on a social network that parents and teachers hide from
A survey conducted at a level of 20,000 gymnasium students revealed an increase in "false Insta" accounts
News has increased fears about sexual content posts
20% of students said they have a "principal" account that parents have
One of five children, some even up to 11 years of age, creates an account on a socialisation network that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 gym students revealed a rapid increase in "false Insta" accounts, referring to the Instagram sharing platform.
The news has increased fears about sexual content posts.
20% of students said they have a "principal" and "clean" account that parents have, but they also have other private accounts.
A mother, who accidentally discovered the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter, noticed the posting of a teenager who wanted to be "violet".
According to research carried out by the United Kingdom Digital Awareness Company and the Association of Directors (HMC – Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference) in independent schools, 40% of young people between 11 and 18 years of age have two profiles, and half of them have recognized that they have secret accounts.
The director of the HMC association, Mike Buchanan, said: "It is alarming that so many adolescents are tempted to create online spaces to which parents and teachers do not have access."
Eilidh Doyle will be "the voice of athletes" in the Scottish Atlas Commission
Eilidh Doyle was chosen for the function of director, without executive power, of the Commission of the Scottish Atlas, at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated field and track athlete in Scotland, and Ian Beattie, the president, described the change as a great opportunity for those who make decisions about sports activity to take advantage of the vast experience it has acquired internationally over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys respect throughout the community of athletes from Scotland, Britain, as well as from all over the world and we are sure that Scottish athletes will have significant benefits with its inclusion in the commission," Beattie said.
Doyle also said: “I’m thrilled to be able to represent athletes and I hope to have a real contribution and help how sports activities are taking place in Scotland.”
The American Nationality Athletic, which won 200 and 400 meters of evidence at the 1996 Atlanta Games in addition to the four gold medals won at the Olympic Games, is now a frequent commentator at the BBC, who remained invalid after having suffered a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors told me that only time will decide if I'll recover or to what extent.
It was a titanic work, but I recovered completely, I learned to go again, and today I do agility exercises!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!"
A breast pump advertising that compares women to cows divides public opinion in the online environment
A breast pumping company has led to the division of public opinion in the online environment with an advertising that compares mothers who breastfeed with cows' milking.
To mark the launch of a pump that wants to be "the first silent and portable breast pump in the world", the consumer technology company Elvie launched an ironic advertising, inspired by a music video, to present the freedom that the new pump offers to breast-feeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of cow hay on a song that includes lyrics such as: "Yes, I thank, but I don't have tail" and "if you haven't noticed, these are not high, but my breasts."
The saying goes: "I pump, I pump, I breast-feed the baby, I pump, I pump, I extract milk from girls."
However, the advertising, published on the company's Facebook page, has sparked controversy in the online environment.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video was the target of mixed reactions from those who viewed it, many of them stating that it brought out the “horories” in the dairy industry.
"It was a very bad decision to use cows to promote this product.
Like us, they must remain pregnant and be born to produce milk, except that children are stolen only a few days from birth," wrote one person.

Another person commented: “It is understandable how traumatic it is for both mother and child.
Of course, why not use them to promote a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added: "An extremely inappropriate advertisement."
Other people defended the commercial, a person claiming that it seemed to him a "hilarious" advertisement.
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd have bought one if I were still breast-feeding.
The pump really made me feel like a cow.
The claim is a little inappropriate, but I took it that way.
But the product is brilliant," wrote one person.
Another person commented: “It’s a funny advertisement that aims at mothers who use the pump (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like ‘vessels’.
It is not an advertising that praises or judges the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women reveals that they danced with discreet pumps introduced into the bra.
The concept behind the campaign is that many women who use the breast pump say they feel like cows.
But Elvie's pump is completely silent, does not have wires or tubes and discreetly fits into a breastfeeding bra, giving women freedom of movement, the possibility to hold their children in arms and even to leave town while using the pump.
Ana Balarin, a partner, consultant and developer at Mother, commented: “The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves such a bold and provocative launch.
Comparing breastfeeding mothers and milk cows, we wanted to highlight what it means to use a breast pump and the challenges in this regard, presenting, in a fun and real way, the incredible feeling of freedom that the new pump will give.
It's not the first time the Elvie pump gets on the front page.
During the presentation of fashion creator Marta Jakubowski at the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the podium while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children have been smuggled into a refugee camp from the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children increased, although the number of people who crossed the border each month remained relatively the same, largely because the rhetoric and tough policies introduced by Trump administration caused the burden of placement of children to sponsors.
Usually, many sponsors are themselves immigrants without documents and fear that they will endanger their stay in the country if they ask to take children.
Risks increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors, as well as other adult family members, must register their fingerprints and that their data will be communicated to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Customs and Immigration Authority, told Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who requested sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The Agency subsequently confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
"About 80% of the sponsors or members of the sponsor's family live illegally in the country, and most of them are foreign offenders.
Which means we're going to keep looking for those individuals," Albence said.
In order to speed up the process of processing in the children's system, the authorities have introduced new rules, according to which children are required to appear in court at one month of detention, and not at 60 days as provided for in the previous standard, according to the employees of shelters.
Many will plead for the case through a video call, not personally in front of an immigration judge, to apply for legal resident status.
Those who are not considered eligible will be deported immediately.
The longer the children stay in custody, the more they can become restless or depressed, which can lead to violent reactions or attempts to escape, according to the employees of shelters and reports issued by the system in recent months.
Advocates stated that these concerns are accentuated to a larger unit, such as Tornillo, where there is a possibility that the signs indicating that a child has problems are not observed due to the size of the unit.
They added that the transfer of children to the refugee camp without providing them enough time for emotional training or to say goodbye to friends could cause trauma, which many of them already suffer.
Syria calls for the American, French and Turkish military forces to withdraw immediately
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked Syrian refugees to return home, although Syria has been at war for eight years.
Moualem, who is also interim Prime Minister, said that foreign military forces are on an illegal Syrian territory under the pretext of combating terrorism and that "the situation will be properly managed".
"They must withdraw immediately and without any condition," he said in the meeting.
Moualem insisted that “the war against terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people died since 2011, and millions of people were uprooted from their homes.
He also said that Damascus will continue "this sacred struggle until we remove terrorist groups and illegal foreign presence from all Syrian territories".
In Syria there are approximately 2,000 military troops from the United States, who are particularly involved in training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
There are also more than 1,000 French military troops in the country devastated by war.
With regard to the refugee problem, Moualem said that there were favourable conditions for their return and accused "a few Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears", which caused refugees to stay away.
He added: “I called for the support of the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate their return.”
"There are political influences on a problem that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have issued warnings that they will not support reconstruction in Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to the end of the war.
United Nations diplomats state that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a demilitarized zone in the Idlib region to expel the last group of rebels has created an opportunity to continue political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish agreement helped to avoid a large-scale assault with the support of Russian-supported Syrian forces on the province where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement has "clear deadlines" and expressed his hope that military action will target jihadist groups, including those on the Nusra front, which have links to the Al-Qaeda network and that they "want to be eradicated".
Staff of Misture, the United Nations emissary, hopes to meet soon at a first meeting of a new committee made up of members of the government and opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and prepare the election ground.
Moualem presented the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that the Committee's activities must be limited to "reviewing the current articles of the constitution" and issued an interference warning.
Why will Trump win second term?
If we were to follow this logic, Trump would be realised in 2020, unless the removal procedure or scandals would close his term of office as president earlier, which most of the liberal audience hopes will happen.
In this case it would be, without a doubt, "the most dramatic end of a term of president of all time!"
So far, it seems that the audience is still interested in the subject.
Since 2014, first-time audiences have doubled to CNN, reaching 1.05 million and nearly tripled to MSNBC, reaching 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, in the early hours, the Fox News TV station is followed, on average, by 2.4 million people, compared to four years ago when it was followed by 1.7 million, and the release "The Rachel Maddow Show" from MSNBC recorded an audience record, with 3.5 million people who followed it in the evenings when important news was broadcast.
"This is a subject that attracts the public, because we cannot understand it," said Neal Baer, the producer of the drama series "Reservation President" at ABC, about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after a catastrophic attack on the Capitol building.
Nell Scovell, a comedy writer with extensive field experience and author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club" has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride through Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told him he was going to vote with Trump.
Why? asked her.
"He said, "Because he makes me laugh," Scovell told me.
In chaos, entertainment is valued.
Of course, unlike anything else is broadcast on TV, the action in Washington could determine the future of the Roe versus Wade case, if immigrant families can be whole and about the state of the global economy.
Changing the position is a luxury that only the privileged public can afford.
However, you are not just an informed citizen when you arrive at the sixth hour of viewing the debate by a committee of experts in the way Bob Woodward uses deep background sources for his book, Fear, about Paul Manafort's 15,000-dollar leather jacket (“an opulent garment object”, according to The Washington Post) and the shocking descriptions of actress Stormy Daniels about Trump's “anatomical parts”.
For example, I'll never look at Super Mario again in the same way.
"A lot of what it does gives you the feeling that you look at a reality show and feed you with subjects every night," said Brent Montgomery, the executive director of the Wheelhouse Entertainment media group and the creator of the show "So let's go", about the ever-changing distribution and the daily fluctuations caused by Trump (the launch of a contest with the American Football Professional League, the praises brought to Kim Jong-Un).
You don't allow yourself to lose an episode, because you're gonna feel like you're left behind.
When I went to visit Mike Fleiss this week in his house on the northern shore of Kauai island, there were 27 degrees outside and it was sun, and he was sitting inside looking at MSNBC and recording from CNN.
It could not be released from the TV, especially as Brett Kavanaugh was about to face the Senate's legal commission and would decide on the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember we were performing some of our common shows in the past, and people were saying, "This is the beginning of the end for Western civilization," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it seems they were right."

External financial resources overwhelming for the tightest intermediate elections associated with the House of Representatives
As a result of a realignment of the electoral districts, from which two mandate holders have resulted in an electoral race for the same function, it is not surprising that the 17th electoral district in Pennsylvania enjoys overwhelming financial resources.
Thus, the new suburb of Pittsburg district ran the Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won the special elections last spring in another district.
Lamb is running against another mandate holder, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents the 12th electoral district of Pennsylvania, which significantly overlaps with the 17th.
Electoral maps were reconfigured after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decided in January that the old districts were not constitutional, and the boundaries of the districts were manipulated in favour of the Republicans.
The course in the 17th new electoral district triggered a competition in funding campaigns between the major funding bodies of the parties, the Congress Committee for the Campaign of Democrats (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a known name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in special elections, of the highest audience, which took place in March for the 18th electoral district of Pennsylvania.
For over a decade the function was occupied by a Republican, and President Donald Trump won in this district with a difference of 20 points.
According to political commentators, democracies enjoy a slight advantage.
The United States took into account the criminalization of the state of El Salvador because of its agreement with China, but then gave up
Diplomas noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Trump had a welcoming meeting with the president of the Republic of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners evacuated the Trump Organization's management team.
The officials of the State Department decided to call the American heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama as a result of "the recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan," Heather Nauert, the spokesman for the department in a statement earlier this month.
But sanctions were taken only against the state of El Salvador, which received US aid of approximately $140 million in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, including reductions in financial aid and visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and the high rate of unemployment and its crimes.
Since internal meetings have made progress, officials in North America and Central America have postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to continue a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migration to the United States.
But by mid-September, the officials at the front of the administration made it clear that they wanted to continue the conference, effectively completing any examination of the sanctions for El Salvador.
Now it is planned that Vice-President Mike Pence will address the conference, scheduled in mid-October, wanting to highlight the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three American ambassadors returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without receiving new messages or harsh sentences from Washington.
A White House spokesman for John Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations only if they were kept anonymous.
Their reports were corroborated by an external analyst, who is a close to the administration and also spoke on condition of keeping anonymous.
Study of history
The next thing that could happen is the report of Special Adviser Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice by President Trump, who now has solid evidence made public.
Moreover, Mueller seems to be guiding his investigation and investigating the existence of a plot between Trump’s campaign and Russia regarding the attack on American elections.
If the Congress changes, Trump will face the appropriate responsibility within the body, even if he is prepared to present himself to the electors and possibly a jury formed by his colleagues.
There are many possible situations and I do not want to suggest that Trump's "fall" is inevitable, which is also valid for his European counterparts.
There are choices that we all have to make on both sides of the Atlantic and that will decide the duration of the investigation.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to give a coup against Hitler only if the West had opposed him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
I failed and lost such an opportunity to avoid the years of massacres that followed.
The course of history depends on such critical moments, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are facing some such critical moments right now.
What if Trump fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since it was reported in this newspaper that last year he suggested that the president be recorded in secret and speculated about his incompatibility with his role as president.
Rosenstein said the Times newspaper story was incorrect.
"How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the Federal Bureau of Investigations concerning Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or correct or if it is confirmed at the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and lying testimony?
And above all, will we vote in middle elections for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail to pass these tests, democracy will have a long winter.
But I don't think we'll fail after the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish of Czech origin who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied me, long ago, the embassy residence.
He survived, emigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the table with steam.
With such an inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans player from Rangers team is optimistic about the game with Rapid Vienna
Thursday, Rangers will be the host team for Rapid Vienna, knowing that victory in the match with the Austrians, after the equally impressive Spanish against the Villarreal team since the beginning of the month, will place it on a strong position to qualify from the G Group of the European League.
A knee accident did not allow Graham Dorrans to play this season up to 2-2 with Villarreal, but he believes that the Rangers team can use this result to its advantage to achieve better performance.
"It was a good point for us, given that Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old player.
"I started the game thinking we'll get a good result and win a point.
We'd probably be able to sign up at the end, but I totally think the equal was a fair result.
I think they were better at the first rendezvous, and we noticed better at the second.
On Thursday, it will be a night again important for Europe.
With little luck we will get three points, but it will be a difficult match, because they had a good result in the last game played. However, having support supporters, we will certainly feel more motivated and we will have a positive result.
Last year was clearly a difficult one, taking into account my accidents and changes from the club, but the situation is better right now.
The team is good and the boys really like to be here; the training also goes well.
Let us hope that we will persevere, that we will leave behind the past season and that we will have good results."
Women have insomnia due to pension savings
Despite the fact that the survey participants knew clearly how they wanted to be cared for, few people talked to family members about it.
About half of the people who participated in the study carried out by the Nationalwide company said they were discussing the cost of long-term care with their husband/wife.
Only 10% of them said they were talking to their children about this subject.
"People want a member of the family to take care of them, but they don't start this conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the nationwide life insurance company.
Here's how you can start.
Talk to your husband/wife and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide you with the care you need if you do not make your desires known over time.
Work with the counselor and the family to discuss where and how you will receive care, as these choices could be a significant factor in setting costs.
Involve the financial advisor: and the financial advisor can be of real help in the payment of these expenses.
Your long-term care funding choices may include a standard long-term insurance policy, a mixed cash life insurance policy, to help you cover these expenses or you can ensure your own well-being – to the extent that you have the money.
Develop legal documents: welcome legal issues.
Get an authority on decisions of a medical nature to designate a trusted person to monitor your health care and ensure that professionals in the field respect your wishes if you cannot communicate them.
Also consider carrying out an authority over your financial resources.
Choose a trusted person to make decisions of a financial nature on your behalf and ensure that your invoices are paid if you do not have the ability to do so.
Don't forget the little details: imagine that a parent of yours with an advanced age has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about his medicines and allergies?
Note these details in a written plan to be prepared.
"And it's not all about the financial side alone. Can you tell who the doctors are in charge of it?" Martin asked.
“What are the medicines?
Who's gonna take care of his dog?
Draw up a plan for all these things."
A man was shot several times with a compressed air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with a compressed-air rifle as he went home after a night spent in the city.
The victim, aged 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police officers described the incident, which took place at 02:30, as “accidentally shots”.
The victim failed to see his attacker.
The wounds suffered did not endanger his life, and the police called on witnesses to give statements.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died because of a strong earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, and it is expected that the number of deaths will increase.
Due to the disruption of communications networks, the disaster authorities were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala Regency, an area in the north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 degrees on the Richter scale.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key information about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of central Sulawesi, which is located at the end of a narrow golf course, on the western coast of the island Sulawesi, with a population of approximately 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated 40 years of existence when it was hit by tsunami and earthquake.
Donggala is a regency that stretches along a coast with an area of more than 300 km north-west of Sulawesi Island.
The Region, an administrative region below a province, has a population of approximately 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming activities represent the central point of the economy of the province of the center of the island of Sulawesi, in particular of the Donggala coastal region.
Mining activities for nickel extraction are also important in the province, but are mainly concentrated in the Morowali on the opposite coast of the island of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami caused the death of more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
Also, in 1996, a tsunami struck the western part of the Donggala regime, causing the death of nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Fire Circle, an area with intense seismic activity.
Here are some of the earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: on 26 December, a strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, north of Sumatra, triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, causing the death of 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them from Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: a 6.8-degree magnitude earthquake on Richter scale struck the southernmost Indonesian island, Java, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: a 7.6-degree magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale took place near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.

Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for vice president Sarah Palin, was arrested following allegations of violence.
Palin, aged 29 in Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested under suspicion of domestic violence, being involved in a complaint of domestic violence and opposition to arrest, according to a report published on Saturday by police in Alaska State.
According to the police report, when a knowledge of her female sex tried to call the police to advertise alleged crimes, she took her phone.
Palin is in police custody, at Mat-Su unit, awaiting trial, and is held on the basis of a $500-dollar bail-free security, according to KTUU.
It was presented on Saturday in court, where it was declared "100% innocent" when it was requested to plead, according to the network.
Palin faces three Class A criminal charges, which means he could be imprisoned for up to a year and amended by $250,000.
He was also charged with a class B offence, which is punishable by a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time Palin's charges have been brought.
In December 2017, he was accused of violence against his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to announce the alleged aggression.
The case is under trial at the Alaska Veterinary Tribunal.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, involving himself in a complaint of a domestic violence crime and having in possession a weapon while he was drunk about an incident.
According to his girlfriend's statement, he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after her son's violent behavior was associated with post-traumatic stress syndrome that she suffered after being part of the military forces in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of deceased people
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-degree magnitude earthquake on Richter scale triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and telecommunications networks are damaged and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the following days.
The earthquake occurred outside the central province of Sulawesi, which is northeastern of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Social networks circulate videos that present the time of impact.
Hundreds of people were at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore.
The federal prosecutor wants capital punishment for the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City
The New York federal prosecutor wants the capital punishment for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the New York City terrorist attack following which eight people were killed, a rare punishment that was no longer applied in the state for a federal offence in 1953.
It seems that Saipov, 30 years old, used a truck rented Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bike track on the West Side motorway of Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and cyclists on its path in October.
In order to justify the capital punishment, prosecutors must prove that Saipov intentionally killed the eight victims and intentionally caused serious bodily injury, according to the Notice of Intention on the Request for the Capital Penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both counts may receive a capital sentence, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, a large federal jury accused Saipov of 22 charges that include eight charges of murder in support of organized crime, usually used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, as well as a charge of violence and destruction of motorized vehicles.
The attack required a "substantial planning and premeditation," said the prosecutors, describing how Saipov carried out the act as "hateful, cruel and depraved".
"Sayfullo Habibullaev Saipov has caused injuries, sufferings and losses to the following families and friends: Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", according to his opinion of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last trial of a case of capital punishment in the Southern District of New York.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was accused of killing two drug dealers, but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last capital punishment applied in a federal case in New York took place in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, two husbands executed after they were convicted of conspiracy at the commission of spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Rosenberg's wives were executed on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the documents of the court, Saipov, Uzbek citizen, did not show any regret in the days and months following the attack.
He confessed to the investigators that he was pleased with what he did, according to the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he felt inspired to execute the attack after watching the videos of the ISIS group on his phone, according to the registrar.
Also, according to the police, he asked to tree the ISIS flag in the hospital room.
He pleaded innocently with regard to the 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the officials who represented Saipov, said that they are “disappointments” of the prosecutor’s decision.
"We believe that the decision to apply the capital punishment, instead of accepting a plea for life imprisonment guilt, without any possibility of release, will only extend the trauma associated with these events for all the people involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team previously asked the prosecutor not to apply the capital punishment.
A member of Parliament forming part of the Conservative Party submits that NIGEL FARAGE must be at the forefront of the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today promised to "mobilize the civilian army" during a protest at the Conservative Party conference.
The former leader of Ukip said politicians should "feel pressure" from Eurosceptics following the statement of a member of the Theresa May Parliament who suggested that it should be at the forefront of negotiations with the European Union.
Peter Bone, MP of the Conservative Party, told a Birmingham demonstration that the United Kingdom "would have gone out" so far if Farage was Secretary to Brexit campaign.
But May's challenge to the extremely divided camps was accentuated by the members of the Conservative Party who joined another protest against leaving the European Union organised in the city.
The Prime Minister tries from the point of view that his compromise plan, the so-called Chequers plan, is taking place properly, facing the attacks on those who support the European Union, those who want to remain in it and on the European Union.
The Allies stressed that it will continue to try to conclude an agreement with Brussels, regardless of consequences, and will force the Eurosceptic and the Labour Party to choose between its offer and "haos".
Bone said in the event of the "Leave Means Leave" pro-Brexit movement in Solihull that he wants "renunciation of the Chequers plan".
He suggested that Farage should be part of the team and that he be given the responsibility associated with the negotiations with Brussels.
"If things were driven by him, I was no longer in the European Union," he said.
Conservative Member of Parliament, the representative of the Wellingborough constituency, added: “I will support Brexit, but we must give up the Chequers plan.”
Referring to his opposition to the European Union, he said: “I have not fought in the world war to be useful.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone denied the suggestions on changing public opinion at the 2016 vote: "It is not true that the British have changed their mind and want to remain in the Union."
Andrea Jenkyns, a member of the Conservative Party that supports Brexit, was also at the demonstration and told reporters: "I just want to say that: Prime Minister, listen to people's voices.
"The public disagrees with the Chequers plan, the opposition will not vote for it, our party will not agree with it and our activists who come out and support us, first of all, in the elections.
Give up the Chequers plan and start listening."
In a message on Theresa May, he added: “The prime ministers who keep their function are those who keep their promises.”
At the rally, Nigel Farage stated that politicians should be put in a position to “feel pressure” if they are about to give up the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"It's a matter of trust between us, people, and our political class," he said.
"Try to betray Brexit and we are here today to tell them that "we will not let them do this."
In a message sent to the enthusiastic thanks, he added: "I want to help us put pressure on our political class, which is about to betray Brexit.
"We mobilize the civilian army of the country that has brought us victory in Brexit and we will not give up until we become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, those who support staying in the European Union marched through Birmingham before a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small group of activists raised banners that the Conservative Party wrote against Brexit after the launch of the group this weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Party, laughed at the Conservative Party members and about the security issues they faced in the application of the party at the beginning of the conference.
"These are people who tell us that they can implement IT systems and all technology for Canada plus, for the digitisation of customs procedures, for free and unrestricted trade in Ireland," he added.
"It's a farce.
Brexit doesn't bring benefits," he added.
Warren plans to think seriously about running for president
Senator Elizabeth Warren of the United States said he would seriously consider running after the November elections.
According to the Boston Globe newspaper, the Democratic Senate of Massachusetts spoke on Saturday about her future during a city hall meeting in the western state of Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for the November elections against Geoff Diehl, member of the House of Representatives of the Republican Party, who was co-chair of Donald Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She was at the center of speculation that could defeat Trump in 2020.
The afternoon event in Holyoke was the 36th meeting of citizens with voting rights using the mayor's format since Trump took over the office of president.
One participant asked her if she was going to run for the presidency.
Warren responded that the time has come for "women to get to Washington to solve the problems of our severely affected government, and this includes that there is a woman in its head."
A suspect was arrested in case of death that caused the death of Sims player from the LSU team
Baton Rouge police, Los Angeles, announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested in the event of death that caused the death of the basketball player Wayde Sims from LSU on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at an ET press conference at 11:00.
They published a video material at the time of Friday's shooting, asking for help in identifying the man in the pictures.
Sims, aged 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head, causing his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul said on Saturday for 247sports.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being on the spot, that he was in possession of a weapon, but also that he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish police department.
Sims, a junior player with a height of 1.98 m, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 matches, being 10 times the initial lot in the last season and playing, on average, 17.4 minutes, with 5.6 points and 2.9 recovers on the game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins the world title after his team helps him win in front of Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton Saturday that the orders given by the Mercedes team will play an essential role in the race.
Finding himself in the first position in the ranking, Bottas had a good start and almost defeated Hamilton, defending his position in the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to stop at the box and leave Hamilton at the group's tail, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes stopped at the box a shift later and came from behind Vettel, but Hamilton managed to advance after a few schemes that forced Ferrari driver to leave the interior free, after he made a double move to protect himself on the third turn.
Max Verstappen started the race in the back row of the cariage and was on the seventh place near the end of the first tour, even on the day he was 21 years old.
Then he was at the forefront for a large part of the race, aiming for a quick final and trying to get past Kimi Raikkonen and take fourth place.
Finally, he stopped at the box at tour number 44, but he couldn't step up the last eight tours, Raikkonen staying on fourth.
"It was a difficult day. Valtteri did an exceptional job all weekend and acted like a real gentleman, letting me pass.
And the team did an excellent job to get the victory in front of Ferrari and to accomplish this double," Hamilton said.
A terrible body language
President Donald Trump ironed Senator Dianne Feinstein on Saturday at a meeting on his insistences such as that she did not facilitate the "scorching" of Christine Blasey Ford's letter, which accused Brett Kavanaugh, nominated at the Supreme Court, of sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony in front of the Senate's Judicial Committee, commenting that what's going on in the Senate showed that people are "real, immoral and lying".
"The only thing that could happen is the beautiful thing that happens in the last days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and wicked and immoral and lying," he said.
"When you see that they published and leaked information and then say they didn't.
They're not responsible.
Do you remember?
When did Diane Feinstein ask if she facilitated the document's "running"?
Do you remember her answer?
Aaa... no.
I didn't do that."
Well, wait a minute.
We did this? No, we didn't," he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh by Ford in July and was "scurried" in September, but Feinstein denied that "scaring" occurred from her office.
"I didn't hide the charges concerning Ford and I'm not the one that facilitated her "discharge"," Feinstein told the committee, according to Hill.
"He asked me to keep confidentiality and that's exactly what I did."
But her denial does not seem to have failed the president, who commented during the Saturday meeting: "To be honest, it was a terrible body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing the defense of the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was accused of sexual assault by three women, the president suggested that Democrats use accusations to achieve their own purposes.
“They are determined to take power in any way possible.
Observe the wickedness, immorality, they don't care who they hurt and who they have to destroy in order to gain power and control," the president said, according to the Mediate website.
Elite League: Dundee's Stars team wins 5-3 in front of the Giants team in Belfast
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against the Dundee team
The Dundee Stars team paid for the loss of Friday from the Elite League, winning in front of the Belfast Giants team at the return game on Saturday, with a score of 5-3 in Dundee.
The Giants team had an advance of two goals, the shots being executed by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equaled the score before Dwyer brought Giants back in front of the opposing team.
Francois Bouchard equaled the score for Dundee before two goals marked by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen ensured their victory.
It was the third defeat of the League of Elites this season for Adam Keefe's players, who had regained ground by defeating the Dundee team on 2-1 Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, Giants winning the last three matches.
Dwyer's opening performance started in the fourth minute, and 3:35 minutes, from Kendall McFaull's step, then David Rutherford moved decisively to Beauvillier who doubled the team's advantage four minutes later.
In a game that started so dynamic, Sullivan brought the host team back into play in the minute 13:10, before Matt Marquardt offered Cownie the chance to score an equal score in the minute 15:16.
Dwyer secured the advantage of the Giants team before the first break, when he entered his second goal at the end of the first round.
The host team regrouped and Bouchard again matched an impressive goal in the minute 27:37.
Later, in the second round, Cownie and Charles Corcoran helped Nielsen get an advantage for Dundee for the first time in that match, thus ensuring the team's climb to place 5 in the ranking, in the middle of the last round.
The Giants team, which has now lost four of the last five matches, will be, on Friday, host to Milton Keynes in their next match.
An air traffic controller died after ensuring the take-off of a plane with hundreds of passengers during an earthquake
An air traffic controller from Indonesia is considered a hero, dying after ensuring safe take-off of a plane with hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people died and many are missing after a strong earthquake rocked the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
There have been several strong replicas in the area and many people are blocked under the rest of the city Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan grande refused to leave his post in the control tower at the Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu, which was shaking heavily.
It remained in place to ensure that the flight 6321 of the Batik Air company, which is on the runway at that time, would take off safely.
Then he jumped out of the air control tower when he noticed that he was about to collapse.
He died later at the hospital.
The spokesperson of the Indonesian air navigation service provider said that the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to ABC News Australia.
I've prepared a helicopter to transport him from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"We are sorry for this news," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands of people, the national disaster management agency stating that access is limited in the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"We believe that the number will increase, because many victims are still under the rubble and we haven't had access to many of them," said the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves of up to six meters high devastated the city of Palu, on Sunday a common funeral will take place.
Military and commercial aircraft provide aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, said for Sky News: “An ambulance brings victims every minute.
It's almost impossible to find drinking water.
All the minimums are robbed."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said for CNN: “The Red Cross in Indonesia is in a hurry to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find on the spot.
It's already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the national army: “Please work day and night to complete all evacuation operations.
Are you ready?" announced CNN.
Indonesia was rocked at the beginning of this year's earthquake in Lombok, which had more than 550 dead soldiers.
Air Niugini says now that a person is missing after a plane crashed into a lagoon
The airline holding the plane that crashed into a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now declares that a person is missing, after previously declared that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that a male passenger has disappeared since the afternoon of Saturday.
He also mentioned that he was trying to find a man, along with local authorities, hospitals and investigators.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional passenger details such as age or nationality.
Local boats were used to retrieve the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
Friday, the authorities said seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained at the hospital Saturday and everyone was stable.
It is not yet known what caused the accident and the exact order of events.
The airline and the United States Naval Forces said the plane missed the runway and arrived in a lagoon near it.
Some witnesses believe that the plane exceeded the end of the track.
American Nationality Passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane reached a very small distance from the ground.
"It's a very good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes also said that he and other passengers managed to cross the water, which had reached the brink, and reach the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also said that shipmates panicked and screamed and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Naval forces said that sailors who worked nearby for the renovation of a debarcader jumped into help, used an inflatable boat to transport people to the shore before the plane sank 30 meters below water.
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people died in accidents of air carriers registered in PNG over the past two decades, but none of them included an Air Niugine aircraft.
An analyst presents the chronology of the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor ended his plea regarding the resumption of the trial for a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst in the United States Department of Justice, testified for several hours as an expert witness in information analysis.
He presented to the jury how he used cell phone records to lead Quinton Tellis's 29-year-old actions, as well as those of his victim Jessica Chambers, 19-year-old, on the night he died.
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she was killed, this being in contradiction to his earlier claims, according to Clarion Ledger.
The moment the data revealed that his cell phone was with Chambers when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was called into the witness box and confessed that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked Tellis if he told the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said that he " lied because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistencies were that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Cell phones records indicate that they had known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after the death of Chambers, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contact details from his phone.
"He wiped it out of his life," Hale said.
According to the timetable, the defence will begin its final plea on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the jury to decide at the end of that day.

A trio that sings hip-hop music wants to change the negative way this kind of music is seen, using songs with positive messages.
The High Breed Group in Bristol claims that the hip-hop has stopped transmitting political messages and addressing social problems, as it initially did.
They want to return to origin and make hip-hop aware to be popular again.
A recent rebirth of artists such as The Fugees and Common in the United Kingdom has been observed through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another person of color?!
A New York nanny sues a couple for firing her after she received a "racist" text message
A nurse in New York sues a couple for dismissal for discriminatory reasons after she accidentally received a text message from her mother, in which she complained that she was still “a person of colour”.
The couple denied that they were racist, claiming that she had sued him for "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed discontent when she found out that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was of colour, when she presented herself on the first day of work in 2016.
"NUUUUUUU! Yet another color person," wrote Plasco-Flaxman to his husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After realizing the gaff, feeling embarrassed, Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice, claiming that the nanny, who is African-American, did not properly fulfill her duties and expected to receive a Filipino nationality nanny, according to New York Post.
Maurice was paid for the day's work and sent home with Uber.
Now, she's suing the couple to be paid compensation for dismissal and is asking for the sum of $350 a day for six months, the period in which she had to live with them and carry out her work, despite the fact that this is done without a contract concluded.
"I want to show them that they don't do such things," she said to the Post on Friday, adding "I know it's discrimination."
The couple denies the claim that they are racist, saying it was a normal thing to fire Maurice, because they feared they could no longer trust her after they offended her.
"My wife sent him a wrong message.
He's not a racist person.
We are not racist people," said Joel Plasco, her husband, for the Post newspaper.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of a person you have wronged, even if it was a mistake?
The newborn child?
Let's be serious."
Considering the process an action of "extrusion", Plasco said that his wife would be born in two months and that she was in a "very difficult situation".
“Do you really want to take revenge on a person in such circumstances?
Don't do that," the bank investor added.
While the process is ongoing, the public opinion accused the couple of social networks, judging them for the behavior and logic they showed.
Paddington's story editors feared that readers would not be able to identify themselves with a bear that speaks, according to a new letter.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after accepting the book, said the following about the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the skin of a person who reads it for the first time before it is published.
It's really funny now, after I saw that Paddington had a huge success."
He also said that his father, who was a BBC cameraman before he was inspired by a toy bear to write the children's book, would have been optimistic about rejecting his work, adding that the anniversary at the time of the 60th anniversary of the publication of books was a "sweet-worn" after he died last year.
About Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family," added her father had a discreet pride in the success he later enjoyed.
"He was a pretty quiet man and he didn't like to brag," she said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was like having a child who had a success: you are proud of him, although it is not your success.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although it was his creation, based on his imagination, he always used to give Paddington the credit."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye by phone
On the landing, her daughter was quickly transported to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"It doesn't often sound to tell me it's very serious and he doesn't think he'll survive," Ednan-Laperuse said.
"Then I got a call from Nad telling me he'll die in the next two minutes and I have to say goodbye to her
And that's exactly what I did.
I said, "Tashi, my dear, I love you very much.
We'll be together soon.
I'll join you.
The effect of medicines administered by doctors to keep her heart pumping blood began to decrease and get out of her body.
He died a little while ago and the organs began to stop working.
I had to sit there and wait, aware of everything that's going on.
I couldn't scream or scream because I was surrounded by families and people.
I was supposed to control myself."
Finally, Ednan-Laperuse, being in mourning after his daughter's death, embarked on a plane along with other passengers, who did not know what was going through.
"He didn't know anybody," she said.
“I kept my head down and tears kept running.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I had a overwhelming feeling of sympathy with Nad.
I realized she needed love and understanding.
I knew how much she loved her."
Two grieving women place various messages on a bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who lost their loved ones because they committed suicide are trying to prevent other people from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place various messages on a bridge in Wales, many of which are motivational and include phone numbers that people can call to receive support.
Sharon Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
Davis, 45-year-old, lives in Lydney and says his son was going to be a promising chef with a molybdenum smile.
"Everyone appreciates his smile.
They always said his smile changed your disposition."
However, he gave up work before he died because he had reached a very unhappy moment in his life.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after taking his life.
Davis said: “I always think it will have a domino effect.”
He created the messages “to tell people that they can call someone or that they can talk to someone, even a friend.
Outside, you need to talk to someone."
Kelly Humphreys, Davies' friend for several years, lost Mark, the life partner he was 15 years old, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t tell me he wasn’t feeling well or depressed,” she said.
"A few days before Christmas, I noticed that he changed his attitude.
He was in a pitiful state on Christmas Day, when the children opened their gifts and didn't even look them in the eye."
She said that her death was a great tragedy for them, but she had to overcome it: “It has caused a lot of pain in the family.
We're devastated.
But we have to go on and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is at stake as a result of the initiation of the investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigations
“I thought that if we could get something similar to what he was asking for – an investigation over a limited period of time and a small extent – we could have a few units,” Jeff Flake said on Saturday, adding that he fears that the commission is about to “disintegrate,” at the bottom of a partisan blockade.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their reticence is entirely due to the temporal factor.
There are only five weeks left until the November 6 elections - if, as expected, Republicans have bad results, their attempts to place the one they want at the highest court elections in the country will be significantly weakened.
George W. Bush has always appealed to the senators to convince them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and through whom he met his wife, Ashley, Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI completes the report?
A vote will take place in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently present.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh can reach at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to make the difference in case of equality and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
The number of fugitives from North Korea falls under Kim's leadership
The number of North Korean fugitives in South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, said a South Korean parliamentary.
Park Byung-seug, quoting data from South Korea's Ministry of Unification, said last year they fled the country about 1,127 people compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the key factors were the more severe border controls between North Korea and China and the higher rates charged by those illegally transporting people across the border.
The Phenian made no public comment.
A vast majority of Northern fugitives are finally given South Korean citizenship.
Seul officials say that more than 30,000 North Koreans crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two parts of Korea.
China considers fugitives rather illegal migrants than refugees and often returns them forcibly.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still practically still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Phenian for a few discussions that had the subject of negotiations on denuclearization.
This took place after the historic meeting between American President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-one from Singapore, when they agreed, in general terms, to collaborate for a Korean nuclear-weapon-free peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused that US sanctions have caused the lack of progress since then.
"If we cannot trust the United States, we will not be able to trust our national security and, in such situations, in no case will we be the first to disarm ourselves unilaterally," Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelossi describes Brett Kavanaugh as "hysterical," saying he is unable to serve the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelossi, the leader of the democratic minority in the House of Representatives, described Brett Kavanaugh, nominated to the Supreme Court as "steric" and said that his temperament is inappropriate for the Supreme Court.
Pelossi made his comments on Saturday in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if there was a woman in this situation, she would have been declared "Isterical," Pelossi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's legal commission, which took place on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied the charges of sexually harassing Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes almost screamed and lost his voice because of the emotions, while discussing his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the charges against him "a grotesque and coordinated murder of character", organized by angry liberals that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelossi said he believed that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, because he showed that he was biased against the Democrats.
“I think it is disqualified with those statements and with the way he attacked the Clinton family and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelossi deviated from the subject when asked whether he would try to suspend Kavanaugh if he would be confirmed and whether the Democrats would win the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I just want to say that: if you don't tell the truth in front of Congress or the FBI, then it's not right, not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court in which you are now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Appeal Court in Columbia District.
Pelossi added that, as a democrat, he is concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Accessible Care Act or the Roe versus Wade case, because he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh ignored the question of whether certain Supreme Court decisions would be overturned.
“It’s not the right time for a hysterical, supportive person to go to court and expect us to say “Oh, how wonderful,” said Pelossi.
And women must be able to handle it.
It's a justified diatribe, it's months and years of accumulated anger and it can't speak without bursting into tears.
"We cry when we get angry," Gloria Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do I?"
She continued: “I received a significant amount of help from a woman in an executive position, who told me that she was also crying when she was nervous, but that she developed a technique according to which, when she got angry and started crying, she told the person she was talking to: “You might think I’m sad, because you see me crying.
I'm nervous."
And then continue.
I thought it was a great thing."
Tears are allowed for the exteriorisation of anger, partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of the clearest memories of one of my first jobs, in an office dominated by men, where I began to cry because of an inexpressible rage, is that I was caught by the head of an older woman, a cool director that I always felt a little afraid of, and took me to the house of the stairs.
"He must never see you crying," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
I think you're sad and they'll be glad they caused you this feeling."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democrat in Colorado State Congress, worked with Gary Hart in the presidential elections.
In 1987, when Hart was caught having an extramarital relationship on a boat called Monkey Business and retired from the race, Schroeder, extremely frustrated, thought he had no reason why he should not even run for the presidency.
"It wasn't a very well thought-out decision," she says laughing, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was one more.
Someone referred to the situation as "White as Snow and the seven dwarfs".
Because the campaign was at the end, she was behind the fundraiser and swore she wouldn't run if she couldn't collect $2 million.
It was a lost fight.
She found out that some of her supporters who had given the men $1,000, they only gave her $250.
"Do they think I get discounts?" she asked.
During his speech he announced that he would not officially launch a company, he was so affected by emotions – as a result of recognition for the people who supported it, frustration caused by the system and the fact that it was so difficult to raise money and target voters instead of delegates, but also anger caused by gender discrimination – that he lost his voice because of emotions.
“You would have said I had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalls about the reaction of the press to it.
"You would have said that one of my sponsors is Kleinex."
I remember thinking about what they're gonna write on my funeral stone.
"Did she cry?"
How can the trade war between the United States and China be beneficial for Beijing?
The salves that announced the beginning of the trade war between the United States and China were absurd and, although there seems to be a long way to end it, the disputes between the two countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, issued the first warning earlier this year, by imposing taxes on key imports from China, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important escalation occurred this week with new taxes, which affected products worth $200 billion (150 billion pounds), effectively applying taxes for half of all Chinese goods arriving in the United States.
Beijing has avenged itself each time, most recently imposing a tax of between 5 and 10 per cent on US products worth 60 billion dollars.
China has warned that it will respond to every blow from the United States and it is unlikely that the world's second largest economy will take a step back in the near future.
For Washington to withdraw, China must agree with its demands, but public surrender to the United States would be too humiliating for Xi Jinping, China's president.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressure of the United States on the trade war could support China positively in the long term, reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision taken in Washington or Beijing could lead to an economic collapse in both countries would actually be more dangerous than expected so far," said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher focusing on Asia at the Center for a New American Security, a group of experts.
Syria is ready for the return of refugees, said Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria claims that it is prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help in rebuilding the country devastated by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
During his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country was improving.
"Today, the conditions on the ground are more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists so that things get back to normal.
Existing conditions allow the voluntary return of refugees to the country they were required to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at day-to-day life and their lives.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians fled the country in 2011, when the war broke out.
Six million people who continue to live in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would be pleased to receive assistance in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that conditional assistance or aid from countries sponsored by the insurgency would not be accepted.
European team wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder 2018 Cup after defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 on Le Golf National from the edge of Paris, France.
The United States has now recorded the sixth consecutive victory in Europe and has no longer won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe returned first after the team led by Danish captain Thomas Bjorn got 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who made incredible efforts in most of the tournament, sent the ball from the initial hit in the water to hair 3 from hole 16, giving way to Francesco Molinari's match.
Italian golf player Molinari has had an incredible performance in all races, becoming one of the four players with a 5-0-0 result since the current format of the tournament has existed since 1979.
American Jordan Spieth lost to holes 5 and 4 in front of the last player in the ranking of the European team Thorbjorn Olesen in Denmark.
The first player in the world ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost in holes 2 and 1 in front of Ian Poulter in England, this is probably his last match in the Ryder Cup.
A veteran of the Ryder Cup, who participated in the eight editions, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the player in Europe with most wins, recording an average of 25.5 points throughout his career.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help myself.
It was a hard year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm extremely happy that I could win the cup again.
It's teamwork and I'm glad we could be helpful," Garcia said, excited, after the European victory.
He handed over the flag to his fellow John Ram, who beat Tiger Woods, an American golf legend, to holes 2 and 1, to the individual game on Sunday.
“I’m very proud that I beat Tiger Woods. I used to watch his games when I was a kid,” Rahm, aged 23.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now holds a 13-21-3 record at the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, who won 14 important titles, being surpassed only by Jack Nicklaus.
All weekend, the American team put a real effort on the golf course, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played great during the entire tournament.
American team captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance of his team: "I'm proud of them, they really worked.
This morning, there were a few moments when I put pressure on the European team.
I've had a crescent fight.
Put your hat down for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We'll regroup. I'll work with PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll go on.
I'm dear to these 12 boys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We need to give them proper respect.
They played better than we did."
