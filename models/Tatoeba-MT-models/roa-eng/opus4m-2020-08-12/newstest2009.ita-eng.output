The Prague Stock Exchange at the closing of the market has had a negative collapse.
After the fall of the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange restored its losses.
The transactions of the CEZ shares have reached almost half the daily trade.
From the beginning of Tuesday, the Prague Stock Exchange resumed from the collapse of the day before it was almost 6%.
Behind this downfall is the collapse of shares on Wall Street.
Thus, we also show a reaction from the market to the result of the vote of the House of Representatives in America, which refused to support the stabilisation plan of the local financial sector.
The collapse of actions in Asia
On Tuesday the shares of Asian Stock Exchanges experienced a dramatic collapse, although the indexes, however, during the day deleted a part of the losses later.
The Hang Seng index of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange during the day cancelled almost 4%, but then also part of the losses stabilized to 2.5%.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which follows the Chinese stock movement at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, dropped by 3.8% while in Shanghai the markets were closed.
The shares at the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than 5%, but in the end the losses amounted to 4.3%.
The Thay-Wan Stock Exchange, according to the local index, dropped by 3.6%.
"The planning of the rescue action is uncertain and this will affect financial markets all over the world," noted the head of Hong Kong's currency office Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, despite being part of China, manages its own financial policy, so it does not depend on the Central Bank.
Hong Kong has interest rates at the same level as the United States.
American legislators, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, should quickly return to the dialogue and approve the proposal for financial support.
Otherwise there is a risk that other countries will also have consequences.
US shares
The American Parliament rejected the support plan of the financial system, for which 700 billion dollars (almost twelve billion Czech kroner) had to be allocated.
The legislators have thus ignored President Bush's appeal to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilise the whole economy.
The US shares on Monday have experienced a disaster and the main indexes of the shares have recorded the biggest collapse for more than a 20-year period.
The Dow Jones index dropped by almost 7% and a collapse of such dimensions was observed last time in 1987.
The index was lowered already before the vote, but as soon as the bill was not approved, it fell free.
The Congress has given up: the US government can increase $700 billion to banks.
The highest representatives of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed on a wider form of economic support agreement for the American financial system.
The vote on this will be at the beginning of next week.
American legislators broke the ice in the dialogue on the approval of the rescue plan in the form of economic aid for the American financial system for a total of 700 million dollars (almost twelve billion crowns).
But it's not said yet.
The representatives of the Congress, therefore, have to define some details of the agreement before they publish the final form of the law and vote on it.
The financial system support plan will be discussed on Monday in the territory of the House of Representatives.
Sunday he told Reuters Agency, the chairman of the Barney Frank Chamber's Banking and Financial Services Committee.
In the Senate, according to some sources, you could vote on the plan probably not before Monday.
According to the savings, the announcement of the approval of the financial plan should be the first and fundamental psychological factor capable of awakening financial markets.
Then, however, there will be a return to reality due to the complexity of the mechanisms with which, in practice, to reach market aid.
Paulson: The Plan must be effective
"We've taken a big step forward."
"We have clarified our different views on the form of the presentation of the package for the stabilisation of the market," Democratic Nancy Pelossi told Bloomberg.
According to the same , the final vote could still take place on Sunday.
The legislators' delegates met on the night between Saturday and Sunday with the American Finance Minister Henry Paulson to give definitive form to the government's financial funds.
These funds should be used to acquire untransferable mortgage assets from financial companies, which lead to serious losses and jeopardise the stability of the entire system.
"We are fulfilling the final agreement of the plan that will work and that must also be effective on the market."
"It is necessary to carry on the recovery plan again, but I think we are there," Paulson said.
The Asian Trade Signal
The global financial crisis is heavily dependent on the markets for the actions that are falling sharply.
According to the Democratic Senator of Nevada Harry Reid, legislators are trying to reach a final agreement at Congress even before Sunday.
They want to calm investors before trade in Asian financial markets, which are, in the matter of time, the first to influence the Monday market following the Congress decision.
But for now it is not definitely clear when the two Chambers of the American Congress will vote on the law and even if negotiations can be arrested at the last moment on some problem.
The legislators hope that it will be approved in the next few days.
But the law will still undergo many changes.
The total amount expected for system support shall be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion dollars must be available as soon as possible as President George Bush has requested.
But the Congress can block the allocation of the remainder of the sum in case it will have the impression that the program does not perform its function, blocking the next $100 billion and after the end 350.
Bush appreciated the progress in negotiations.
Although the President may veto this decision, the Congress may overcome its right of veto.
Despite these changes, the basic thinking of the program has remained, i.e. to get the finances to buy the passive mortgage values, whose price has collapsed due to hundreds of thousands of Americans who are unable to pay their mortgages.
"We've worked it out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on Sunday law and the Monday Senate," as mentioned by the Republican senator.
Progress in negotiations is also welcomed by the American President Bush.
His spokesman Tony Fratto stated that Bush is satisfied with Saturday's positive trend and appreciates "the effort of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy".
Restriction of golden parachutes
The president of the Senate bank committee Christopher Dodd, the principal spokesman, said that the legislators agreed on the responsibility of the financial programme, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the closure of the budget for reductions, the division of the financial plan.
The new law must also limit the so-called golden parachutes for the managers of the companies participating in the programme and is setting up a committee that will control the funds.
These should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard and we have made a big step forward towards the agreement that will work and will be useful for the market and also for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan relies on the aid to owners of homes that have problems with payments.
The government should negotiate the new mortgage rates that it will buy with the aim of lowering the monthly expenses on the mortgages for debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: psychological support
The proposed plan is, according to the main economy of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea but its realization will be very difficult.
"And that's because we don't know how and for what price the problematic assets will be bought
This will determine how losses will be divided between them the financial sector and the government," said Marek this week for the iHNed.cz website.
If the plan will be approved now or at the beginning of next week it is not, according to Marek, so fundamental.
"Most importantly, this week the representatives of the Congress agree on the support of this plan and baptize it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of this agreement that will be approved is at this time more important," Marek stressed.
Last blood duel: MP3 players against mobile phones
We will recommend how to choose
While almost every mobile phone can read MP3 files, no MP3 player can call.
It is clear from this that it is best to buy only the phone.
Despite this, there are many reasons for obtaining an autonomous reader.
The choice depends entirely on the manner of use and on the needs of the future owner.
Perhaps you would hardly buy a expensive high quality turntable to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
First of all, these musical products do not come out as LP and qualitatively for this reason there is no objective reason.
But if on your shelves you stack vinyls of hard-rock, jazz or blues probably, a turntable like that at least you dream about it.
It also works with portable music, i.e. compressed music or simply in MP3 format.
Here too, there are price and quality categories.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend for an 8 thousand crown reader, as well as a Pink Floyd fan perhaps hardly digests the headsets by twenty crowns of the market.
Two extremes of which there is enough space for everyone.
The choice is broad.
To decide is the duration of the batteries.
Some high-quality music players are able to do much more than just read music, but they don't even make cell phones by mistake.
There is no other current device as universal as the cell phone.
Along with primary functions, call and send text, you can read music and video, record both and have a camera, sometimes better sometimes worse and maybe you can also navigate.
And if we consider smartphones and palm trees you will also have a miniature computer in your pocket.
It is a small miracle that no refrigerator can do the grill and no television can photograph anything.
The universality of the mobile phone also brings disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your mobile phone and before the indicator on your screen will require the charger.
And reading music consumes a lot of energy.
Few mobile phones are able to read music for more than twelve hours, usually, and much less.
In this sense the music readers (especially the simplest ones) are much more effective.
As far as economic phones are concerned, they may last for more than a few hours.
If you still add us, from time to time, some calls, get yourself another charger at work for safety, this also applies to the most expensive equipment.
But you won't have this problem with an MP3 player, even the worst last for at least 9 hours with continuous functionality with a charging.
Another problem exists when you download music in your mobile phone.
Unfortunately only a limited portion of devices have the universal USB port and in addition not all can connect to the computer without special software.
Certainly the music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only a few memory readers are able to do it without adapter for minicards that are not used in mobile phones.
Readers, except for some exceptions (Ipod) do not need any special software.
Just fill the device with the music via USB from the computer.
Most phones and readers create themselves a multimedia library ordered by the names of the performers, album names, genres or user classification.
Some devices only reproduce the folder tree structure, similar to the Explorer tool in Windows, and some know how to do both things (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent phones with operating system).
Readers are easier to handle, mobile phones can do more.
When you choose a particular device, you are especially interested in battery resistance, memory capacity, quality and type of audio outputs, and clearly about ease of use.
If the music serves you mainly as a background and if you listen to it every day only briefly on the tram you need a cell phone that reads MP3.
This is done now, clearly to any cell phone.
You don't have to worry too much about which formats your phone or reader recognizes.
MP3 players support them all, most of the music that comes to you will be in this format.
In addition to this format belonging to the most popular ones, the total majority of devices support music in WMA format.
There is less AAC (format used by Apple company and its iPods).
The best cell phones also allow, for example, to buy music online.
Simply visit, through the mobile internet network, the corresponding pages of the operator (or another provider) and buy the song or album.
This same service could already be a valid topic to buy a mobile-reader.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is poor and is usually limited only to hits of the time of the radio.
Prices are not very low.
But it is generally assumed that this very mode of sale of music (either via GSM , internet or wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always take the phone behind them.
Anyone who wants to listen to some fruga in their pocket while the MP3 player is forgotten at home.
However, it also depends on this, if you always carry the headphones or at least the wireless headphone.
If not, you can use the built-in player that almost every mobile phone, but only a small part of MP3 players has.
Perhaps the biggest advantage of mobile-readers will be, for many, the price.
The cheapest ones normally cost less than 3 thousand crowns.
For 3 and 4 thousand crowns you will already buy a very dignified walkman.
Usually, however, you will be limited by the absence of an entrance for the common headphones.
The best cell phones and from a technical point of view more equipped and also with a 3.5 mm socket for common headphones cost up to 15 thousand crowns.
Instead, the benefit of readers is, in addition to others, easy handling.
Those simpler not necessarily cheaper (see our choice) really make us anyone to handle them.
The minimum functions, the similarity of handling at one time with the common stereo or perhaps the turntable, are obvious.
There is no danger of accidentally hitting the start of the mobile internet network and as a result of a giant bill for data transmission.
Which apparatus to take
Even the cheapest cellphones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have an interchangeable memory card slot (type M2, microSD etc.).
Even as regards the purchase of the respective card, they fall within the 2 000 crowns.
But be careful.
Base models only support cards with the maximum capacity of 2GB.
Only the most expensive ones do it with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and you want to buy even an inexpensive MP3 player, take Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not have to spend more than 1 100 crowns.
If you are one of the most demanding listeners you prefer to take specialized mobile phones - walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have individual buttons for MP3 and the convenience of the service thus approach the same MP3 player.
In this area has made more roads Sony Ericsson, whose phones of the walkman line have the same scale of use as MP3 players sold separately.
The MP3 players of the above brands provide you with the same service and price category up to 4 000 crowns, but with greater memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery resistance (commonly 15 hours, in principle up to 35 hours).
The first virtual operator will reach the Czech Republic since this year.
Maybe
Perhaps the mobile telephony market in the Czech Republic is mature enough and our operators offer virtually all services like their partners in Western Europe.
There is still something missing – a virtual operator that obliges traditional ones to lower the price.
Maybe he won't be missing for long.
The fact that Czech operators belong to the most dear ones in Europe has already been written many times on Mobil.cz.
In the end ČTÚ also confirmed it, which pointed out that the price of SMS is higher than in the rest of the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the area of regularising roaming tariffs perhaps a paradoxical situation will be created - for some customers of Czech mobile operators SMS will cost less from abroad than at home.
How is it possible for prices in the Czech Republic to remain so high in relation to Europe?
The answer is simple, lacks the competition that would really like to start the fight .
Perhaps it sounds absurd, even here we have three mobile networks and cover highly above 100 %.
Instead, mobile telephony operators like to complain about the fact that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this sense, he also often emphasizes the head of the Czech Telecommunications Council (ČTÚ), Pavel Dvořák, who in the past has expressed that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It is perhaps true that the traditional operator with his network has probably no more possibilities. (Otherwise it might be difficult to find other frequencies now).
But there is still another possibility - the virtual operator.
The entry into the market of virtual operators has led to a substantial reduction in prices, to which traditional operators would have to react.
At the same time even before the entry of sharks such as Tesko Mobile and Virgin Mobile into the market, similar voices were heard in Britain as we did.
However, it has been shown that the place for operators of this kind exists and that they can really succeed.
At the end of the day, we must not go too far.
In February of this year we informed you of the arrival of the Virtual Operator Mobilking in Poland.
In only half a year this operator has managed to conquer more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest local operator.
At the same time behind Mobilking is the Penta financial group to which the Czech Republic belongs, among other things, U:fon.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility of focusing on a much more concrete brewing group.
In order to actually work, many fewer customers are enough than a traditional operator.
They do not carry behind, i.e. relatively high costs for the creation, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
So in the world virtual operators usually present at low cost, offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often in balance with the offer of the most restricted services
So for example Tesco Mobile in Britain offers SMS that cost at least half of its competitors.
But as shown by the example of Mobilking in Poland can be a pretty good move even the bet on a group-blow not very soon.
This operator focuses specifically on men.
"The real men choose Mobilking operator that they like and can trust," says David Seibertz CEO Mobile Entertainment Company that produces this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether we can also affirm a concept similar to that of Poland.
He doubts the press spokesman for Vodafone Miroslav Čepický: "The Czech market is relatively small for a fragmented approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition from the point of view of the services it is relatively saturated."
In the Czech Republic no possibility, say mobile network operators
But it seems almost certain that if there will ever be an operator in the Czech Republic it will not be Mobilking.
"We talk about the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic negotiations do not have many expectations.
Mobilking's ignition will take place rather in the other countries of our area," said in a telephone dialogue for Mobile.cz Jana Studničková, the press spokesman for the Penta financial group.
It has thus confirmed indirectly that the current operators in the Czech Republic are not very favourable to this thought.
Instead, try to do everything because you don't create any potential competitors.
For some time now, he has not been hiding his interest in starting a virtual operator, the GTS Novera group that would like to take another step towards becoming a real competitor of Telefonika O2 in the field of business customers.
"We have a great interest in offering our customers not only fixed services but also mobile telecommunications.
And it's better first.
We have repeatedly negotiated this possibility with all Czech mobile network operators.
We have already made progress in negotiations with some of them," says the spokesman for the Pavel Kaidl group.
So maybe better times will come.
From unofficial information it emerges that the first virtual operator may have to have it by the end of the year.
But for now around its creation there is an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At the moment we do not believe that there is room in the Czech market for creating a virtual operator in full title.
The Czech market, unlike other markets, is very specific.
So far no subject with a complex and serious project has turned to us," he mentioned in his statement for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sršeň of the press section of Telefonika O2.
The specific features of the Czech market also apply to other operators.
The press spokesman for T-Mobil Martina Kemrová adds in a rare agreement with the O2 declaration: "For now we have not noticed any vital and advantageous commercial project for both, on which it is possible to continue to build".
And he adds: "On the T-Mobile network a virtual operator will hardly appear by the end of the year.
At this point we will have already had to have a concrete agreement on the table, so that it could be considered on the horizon."
Vodafone concentrates his attention rather than reaching his demands for the 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický adds: "We are open to the negotiations of potential virtual operators, especially in the context of the sharing of expenditure and infrastructure.
Let us consider this, from the point of view of the customers, the most productive.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a common network for fast mobile internet."
The competent authorities - with the complicit operators
The attitude of mobile telephony operators can easily be understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would lead to lower prices and thereby reduce profits.
Why then facilitate the rise of such a competitor?
The discomforts around the creation U:fon testify that when operators hold to something they know how to row on the same side.
Perhaps the great pressure imposed on ČTÚ during the creation period of U:phone to the company of T-Mobile.
This testifies to public access information from ČTÚ websites.
But right now U:fon serves as a topic for which not to accept the virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová observed: "The environment of competition in the mobile telephony market has been little further enhanced with the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
With regard to the type of mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that the entry of another competitor would focus on him and above all on his high claims services."
However, the attitude of mobile operators is quite surprising the complete lack of interest by Czech regulators.
It is not only the attitude of ČTÚ that unfortunately in the Czech Republic - unlike Britain and other developed countries - has no competence to interfere in the economic competition.
It belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (UOHS).
However, this with regard to the whole problem has taken its typical position.
"The virtual operator's entry into the mobile telephony market would be possible after the conclusion of the contract of rental of the necessary infrastructure between mobile operator and virtual operator had been realized.
No such contract has been concluded so far because the offer of potential buyers has probably not been interesting enough for traditional operators," said Kristián Chalupa, of the section for UOHS external relations, in response to our questioning.
Such a statement by the representatives of the operators may not be surprising.
Instead, the office that needs to defend the interests of consumers and, above all, to deal with the fact that no one takes advantage of its position on the market, is more than a delicate business.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "Outside where virtual operators commonly operate, we can observe that their entry into the market has contributed to lowering prices for mobile phone services."
But of course the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the lowering of prices do not belong to the interests of UOHS.
Truly shocking throughout the situation is the almost exciting harmony of these three operators resulting from their reactions.
The question of whether this is really just a coincidence is on its own.
Equally as the same price of petrol for all petrol is certainly the result of coincidence and competitive struggle.
"The section found no signs of anti-competitive behaviour regarding this fact and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
No operator has a dominant position, so it has no corresponding greater responsibility for its behaviour on the market.
The necessary instruments for the opening up of the mobile network market for virtual operators may also be lacking by the telecommunications regulator," mentioned Chalupa in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many controversial points .
Of course there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by ČTÚ, according to which telecommunications are from the point of view of economic competition the only market.
On such a market, of course, no Czech operator has a dominant position.
But some legal experts offer another approach - for the creation of a virtual operator the agreement of the network operator is always necessary.
And the mobile operator has – at the end of the accounts logically – the monopoly of its network.
So for a certain portion it must be dominant by force.
But even if we do not accept this argument, for UOHS it should be a minimum warning that three mobile operators do in such a strange way.
At the same time the complaints by the interested parties (including the aforementioned company GTS Novera) show that during negotiations with all operators they encounter very similar obstacles.
Downloading responsibility to ČTÚ in telecommunications is a fairly frequent makeup with which UOHS is held out of the whole matter.
We have already found this in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, it has not been possible to promote the expansion of ČTÚ's rights in the field of economic competition in telecommunications until the recently approved telecommunications law was updated, despite the fact that many experts expected to improve the situation.
This fact the representatives of UOHS must know more than well, but perhaps their interests are elsewhere.
You can do it when no one's watching
While we do not realize that these pseudo-virtual operators remain functioning, some of which even exist in the Czech mobile networks.
These are companies that publish their own price lists of mobile telephone services which are only partially public.
These are usually companies that deal with multilevel marketing.
For example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and a number of others offer their mobile phone services.
The price lists of these companies usually only reach the people who are set.
The magic is in the fact that the company vis-à-vis the operator appears as a classic company customer, which orders a large amount of SIM card.
As an important customer then receives special price offers (and more).
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such a presale.
"If the cases you are discussing, of which we will be interested, could be a breach of the contractual conditions, and could lead to the conclusion of cooperation with this company," replied Martina Kemrová.
But it is unlikely that such an activity would not reach the ears of the persons responsible for mobile phone operators.
Especially in the case of the 3 companies mentioned it can be thousands of customers.
No operator at the same time defends himself from such an attitude.
From the activities of these companies, they are profiting in no way indifferent and at the same time - unlike the real virtual operators - are not harmed in any way by their official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns about possible problems: "The law allows similar speculations, however only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
They must also accept that the SIM card on their phone is not registered on their behalf, so they cannot fully dispose of it as the usual customers of mobile phone operators "
But this should be a little bit odd to the ČTÚ.
In addition, another question arises for UOHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes to such an attitude, why block the creation of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that UOHS has rights strong enough to reveal similar activities and if it does not wish to be satisfied with the explanation of operators who have no idea of all this and whose commercial conditions prohibit it.
When we're no longer expensive
As has already been said several times in the text, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile telephony market has led to a substantial reduction in prices for services.
At the same time in virtually all the countries where operators were born, traditional operators tried more or less to prevent their creation.
The arguments they used were practically identical - too small market, too saturated limit, problems with the quality of services etc.
But in the developed countries in these cases the regulatory bodies have intervened in defence, not of mobile operators but of their customers.
Both with the formal measures and with the non-formal pressure, then came to the creation of the first virtual operator and he joined others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators launch each other the whole case like a hot potato.
For our experience we cannot get rid of the feeling that the lack of clarity of competence in these cases makes him more than comfortable.
But we don't throw away the sponge.
If the information of the backstage is right and the virtual operator will really appear from us soon, the Czech mobile phone market will be back in motion.
If one of the operators had consented to the creation of a virtual mobile operator only hardly UOHS could remain impassable to the refusal (discrimination) of the other concerned.
And we may stop calling at higher prices than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four new versions of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the day of recognition of the Czech State presented in a solemn manner the new recordings of the national anthem "Kde domov mönj".
The new recording of the hymn was made by the national theatre orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available – solo with male or female voice, chorus step and instrumental edition.
The song is under the direction of Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the anthem reviews are Otakar Jeremiaš and Jaroslav Krček.
On iHNed.cz you can listen to all four versions.
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national song one of the most beautiful hymns.
He already told the radio "Český rozhlas" that he chose specifically to sing the variants alone, the singers with the most representative young voices, which are expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I tried to take care that both and even the choir, have the clear statement, that the text is well understandable, that it is in harmony," he said.
Then the national anthem will celebrate next year's 175th anniversary.
The song "Kde domov męj" was played for the first time in 1834 on the stage of the Stavovskéh divad it in the original work Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl accompanied by the music of František Škroupa.
He has acquired popularity and people have spontaneously made it his.
The first stanza of the song after the founding of the Czechoslovakia of 1918 became the natural part of the national anthem.
It remained one of the seven national symbols even after the birth of the autonomous Czech Republic.
How the "new" hymn sounds
On Wednesday MHD Prague will accompany you for the first time also with an electronic card
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be written in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date on which the first passengers who in place of the paper ticket will have in their pocket an electronic card will be taken up in the subway, tram and bus.
Right now if you can get it about a hundred thousand people who own their Opencard card.
Passengers can buy the 30 and 90 days and annual one (which will last from January 1, 2009) and at the same time have their paper recharged in the Infopoints and offices of the Transport Company and at the Muzeum metro station, Męstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
Tailors can already be purchased on the Internet from the Transport Company page www.dpp.cz from yesterday.
The service took advantage of more than four hundred customers before the afternoon.
Those who will start using the Internet service can completely forget the doors in the subway stops where so far they had to make long files for paper tickets.
The cutting is purchased via the internet and on the Opencard they charge it on one of the twelve branches of the Municipal Library.
"In these places passengers have a workshop with trained staff that will help those interested in buying on the internet and will also record on their credit card acquired." said project spokesman Martin Opatrný.
In addition to the libraries it will be possible to load electronic cutters on the Opencards in ATMs and selfservices that are installed at the entrances of the metro.
How are these ATMs?
They are red, look like ticket oblivors, and passengers have already noticed them at the stops of the metro Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Now there are five in the whole city but by the end of the year there should be eighty," concluded Opatrný.
The cutting will be controlled instead of by the driver by the ATM.
The ATM service that will work from tomorrow is very simple.
Just insert the Opencard card and after payment of the cutting, it will load up.
Electronic cards are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
That is, in the urban lines of trains and buses from number 300 to 499, which the inhabitants of the municipalities of Central Bohemia take to reach the capital.
"In the trains added in the integrated transports of Prague there are controllers equipped with card readers with which they check the temporal and zone validity," explained the way of checking Filip tickets by the Ropid organization, which develops the schedules of the collective transports of Prague.
Urban buses have the readers of the cards integrated into the driver’s case.
During the ascent it is therefore necessary not only to show the magnetic paper to the driver, but also to support the Opencard at the point determined next to the box.
So the driver checks the validity of the loaded cutters.
"If the passenger needs to check the validity of the loaded cutters, there is nothing easier than asking the driver this kind of information," Drápal added.
Passengers who take urban buses and will not remember, when the cutting is over, can again go to the self-service ATMs, where the cutters are loaded on paper.
Here you will see the information about the validity of their documents on the device screen.
The Germans in the South wanted a referendum from the USA.
The Swedes Germans in 1945 asked to include Šumava in the United States.
This is from the letter deposited in the scientific library of South Bohemia.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live under the patronage of the United States at least.
With this desire, according to what is said, some groups of Germans from the South approached the President of the United States in 1945.
This is also the result of the letter stored in a private archive and now deposited in the scientific library of South Bohemia.
The Germans of Český Krumlov ask in the letter to the American president not to allow the return of the "District of Šumava" – occupied by Hitler on the basis of the Monaco agreement – to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation and we want to be sure of the promises so that American units come to German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," is written in the letter signed with the words "People who hold to the fate of Šumava with all their heart."
Since, they say, the annexation to Czechoslovakia – knowing the Czech national character – gives the Germans of the South to hope only for brutality, lack of concerns, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American president to assume the protettorate on Šumava now and always.
"We cannot believe that without respect for the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants, You will recognize this territory as a foreign state to us, which oppresses and eradicates ethnic minorities and has contributed nothing, for nothing, to the victory of the Allies," writes the letter.
The reason why the authors cannot sign it is the alleged fear of the thirst for revenge by the "Czech oppressors".
If the president of the USA had to doubt the conviction of the Germans of Šumava , it would be enough to organize a referendum in the district on the will of its inhabitants to become part of the USA or live under the control of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may seem naive with our knowledge of the post-war history, according to some witnesses it appropriately describes the expectations of the then Swedish Germans.
Even though the Czech Germans had to at least understand that it would be their move from the republic, only a few of them fully admitted such a possibility.
Some expected the United States and Great Britain to negotiate some kind of autonomy for the peoples of the South.
Others believed that they would simply remain in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
He was mobilized during the war as German of Budějovice in the maritime power of the Baltic Sea.
When he was captured by the British at the end of the war and put in the prison camp in Holštýn, the dozens of other Czech Germans went to find him so that he could teach him the Czech.
"They thought once you came home the Czech would make him comfortable," said Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners who lived in Czechoslovakia was the prime of war, he said that on the basis of the Beneš decrees they would be moved from the Republic.
You won't pay!
The emotional campaign will attack the drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
This could also be defined as the emotional media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport intends to set off on Wednesday.
The office of Minister Aleš ★ebíček, expects this to discourage drivers from dangerous driving behaviour.
The 150 million campaign will appear on television, radio, cinema, internet as well as on the flyers.
It should discourage drivers from driving fast and under the effect of alcohol on the steering wheel.
And remind him to put his belt on before he leaves.
He wants to touch the conscience especially young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and not lastly professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Especially stories of people who will affect emotions.
And this also testifies to the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign:
You won't pay!
The word "don't think" is capitalized on the plate.
And in a pool of blood is the word "you'll pay."
This must symbolize that a person can in a moment of distraction pay with his own life.
The spots "will scare" the spectators by 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where images of the victims of accidents can be commonly seen.
It is thus promised to reduce the number of accidents and deaths on the Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Carrot and stick to drivers
"The carousel and stick system works with the drivers.
The carrot for them is for example when they pass with red and thus save time.
The stick is the danger of fine or accident.
The risk to drivers should be remembered," says the psychologist of the Ministry of Transport Martin Kořán of Na Homolce Hospital.
And so it takes information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertising, the psychologist believes.
According to him, the panels that alert the risk drivers are already less effective.
"If the fixed panel that alerts to danger has been installed, it will probably soon be confused with the environment and the drivers will no longer pay attention to it," Kořán warns.
Olmert would return almost all the occupied territories in exchange for peace
The Prime Minister of the Interim Israeli Government Ehud Olmert expressed himself for the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, that is, also the borders of Jordan, East Jerusalem and the heights of Golan, in exchange for peace between Palestinians and Syrians.
So he said in the dialogue that he published Monday, the newspaper Jediot Achronot.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all areas (occupied), if not all," Olmert said to the daily.
"We will have a certain percentage of these territories but the Palestinians will have to leave the same percentage (of the Israeli areas), because without this there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that the possible refund would also include East Jerusalem .
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and above all does not want the raspberries or esplanator to pass on to him, as happened to one of my best friends, must give up a part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in the light of the two attacks of July in the city, during which some people were killed and dozens of people injured.
According to the prime minister you will need to find "a particular solution for the Mountain of the Temple, the sacred and historical places," which are inside the Old City. .
"He who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he also stressed.
The withdrawal from the heights of Golan
Olmert also spoke for Israel's withdrawal from Golan's heights, that is, in his view, the essential condition for concluding this peaceful agreement with Syria.
But this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose the conclusion of peace with Syria solely on the basis of the withdrawal from Golan," he warned.
"The Syrians know well what they will have to give up to get Golan's heights.
They will have to give up the current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with the Hezbollah (Science Movement); they will have to give up their permanent support, offering Hamas terrorism, Al-Qaida (the terrorist network) and Jihad (the holy war) in Iraq," said the Prime Minister.
Questions after the accident: Are bus drivers illegal?
The law does not recognize them, you cannot walk on the long distance bus
In the context of the tragic accident near the Italian city of Padua of the bus of the Student Agency the question was raised whether the drivers and passengers could move on board the bus during the race.
"If we want to respect the laws strictly and formally, the activity of the steward is in conflict with the law of road traffic," says the spokesman for the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The accident last week with which a 22-year-old hostess lost her life was caused by a truck that cut off the road to the busman.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver in the less secure position of the bus, despite the fact that there were still two other seats assigned.
But the bus can make an accident or abruptly brake even at the time of distribution of coffee or newspapers.
It depends whether the bus is equipped with standing posts according to the traffic booklet.
If passengers are not approved, they shall be seated.
Student Agency buses did not stand, confirmed it to Aktuáln.cz website the director of Radim Jančura.
"We assessed this with the Ministry and at first it did not allow the passenger movement on the bus.
After it was revoked and we concluded that passengers can use the bathroom during the race if they have the assigned place," he expressed his point of view.
The law doesn't recognize the steward.
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of the steward – no law deals with the regularization of this role."
However, no regulation prohibits the carrier from carrying out the services.
The law of road traffic recognizes only the term accompanying the vehicle, its rights and duties are not defined," the spokesperson Hanzelka added less clearly.
The Director of the Department of Road Traffic of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorný, however, believes that the law takes care of this problem sufficiently.
Depends if the bus has the seats approved.
It's all there," he says.
Categorizes buses in urban areas where there are standing places and maximum speed limited, interurban with standing places with highest maximum speed and long handling without standing positions with maximum permitted speed and seats equipped with seat belts.
As on the plane, says the expert.
The expert BESIP on road safety Jaroslav Hořín does not find the fundamental problem in the steward movement on board the bus.
"During a quiet race there are not many dangers, the situation can be compared to the air service.
Nor is it safe when a turbulence arrives and the flight attendant can shake his head."
"If the bus makes a sudden braking of course it is worth the laws of physics.
Same as on the urban bus or on the tram.
The carrier company must solve the safety of the stewardess with an internal regulation," he said and also understood that, from the point of view of the law, the problem was not solved.
Jančura is willing to suspend the services.
Student Agency is the only transport company offering steward services..
This employs about two hundred.
Even after the accident, the Director considers their work dangerous.
"As soon as I have the feeling of having to consider the steward's profession as a dangerous job, I will abolish it.
Passengers can receive coffee and newspapers as they leave.
They would also reduce expenses," he says.
Asian director Alexej Litvin, who manages a fraction of the lines compared to Student Agency, has motivated the absence of the stewardess on his means as an interest in security.
"We have no hostess, we are already opposed from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end with a fatal accident," said less than a year ago Týden.cz.
There has been an enormous tragedy.
In the accident of the line for Naples, a young hostess of the region of Plzeň died, who had worked for the company for two years.
A Slovenian truck probably came out of the emergency lane without using the arrow and blocked the road to the bus.
The bus driver tried to avoid it with a sudden maneuver, but hit it with the front right.
Jančura rejects the fact that the two seats reserved for the rest of the Stewarts were occupied.
"It is not possible to reserve these places in long-distance buses, they are inaccessible."
The company is planning to report the driver of the truck.
The agency will not wait for the judgment of the Court to pay the damage to the girl’s family, but a financial compensation is expected from the offender.
The revision of the law?
Not in view
The revision of the law, on which a group of 30 experts from the Ministry of Transport has worked for more than a year, could lead to a clarification of the Stewart movement on board buses.
"But they did not achieve any concrete results.
They are not considered by the buses, they deal more with the punctuation system, maximum speed on the highway and use of the mobile phone during driving," says the expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not regard the work of Stewart as a major threat to passenger safety," concludes spokesperson Havelka, who is responsible for the control of bus safety by the police and the security offices.
The hopes of Düsseldorf point to Frankfurt
There are no missing words in the letter from the director of WestLB addressed to the employees of the house.
In the letter published on Monday that could form "the capital market centre of the financial group of savings banks" through the unit meeting of the banking institution of Düsseldorf with the Deka-Bank of Frankfurt.
The West LB would launch a "competent block" with lasting profits in such a company.
Moreover, such a union could be a decisive step towards further links in the Länder's banking sector.
So it is read, when a board of directors in difficult times wants to demonstrate the ability to act.
Because the WestLB struggle is still under great pressure.
Not only on the part of the EU Commission, but also through the National Financial Supervisory Authority, having noted some time ago to the regional government of North Rhine-Westphalia that time is constraining the search for a future solution.
Links between the Deka-Bank, that the same customers of the Savings Fund because of their investment funds already know, and the WestLB is certainly already talking about it for quite a while, even by Frankfurt.
He reported at the end of August the head of Deka-Bank Franz Waas at the time of the presentation of the first half of the year's turnover that a merger of the house at Via Magonza with a national bank such as Helaba or West LB makes no sense.
However, Deka's administrative adviser, who half of which is brought by regional banks and savings fund consortia, delegated the board of directors to conduct talks with the West LB on joint contracts.
It could be market negotiations or parts thereof.
But conversations have, as they say in business square, just started.
Della Deka-Bank, with its 3000 employees, is one of the most important in Frankfurt's business square, it is not mentioned for the first time when it comes to consolidating the savings sector.
In 2003, for a short period, Deka-Bank seemed to be able to merge with the regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate and Helaba.
Of this association to three, nothing was done.
As soon as the projects were published, the regional bank of Asia was opposed to Helaba's participation.
The remaining two institutions have also proved unable to reach an agreement.
The Rhine-Palatinate regional bank went instead to the Baden-Württemberg regional bank in Stuttgart.
Yet they have always thought of us for a merger of the Deka-Bank with regional banks.
But in the end Günther Merl, president of Helaba's governing board, spoke out against design games to meet with his home.
Apart from this, it seems that cognition is created, that it is necessary to bring the different houses of the public sector closer together.
Since the election of the Bavarian Parliament has passed, a meeting of the Bavarian Landesbank could first be held with that of the Baden-Württemberg.
For Helaba, it's not entirely good news.
If it increases pressure for other mergers, the partners will be missing.
In the South now there would be the junior partner, although so far he has overcome the financial crisis much better than houses in Monaco and Stuttgart.
The association of the savings banks of Asia-Turingia, which participates with 85 percent of Helaba, put the chain at the meeting with the WestLB.
Only the NorthLB would remain
These geo-strategic reasonings are just an account.
On the other hand, there is also the question of how the different business models of individual houses are compared.
In June Merl pointed out that the decisive question, with which business model the future of the regional banks would be assured, would not yet be answered by the association of German savings banks.
In the end the division of the West LB might also come out, which on the part of that naturally is not wanted.
So the letter from the board of directors expresses the desire to aspire in any case to a "general solution".
You will see how the reunification of the individual parts will work with the Deka-Bank.
The second weekend of the beer festival is dedicated to Italians
For Elena it's the first time while for Luca it's the third or the fourth.
This time Elena is present at the party as a companion, and so she says everything is different.
Behind them next to the 5l. barrel of the Kaiser brand stands a massive bearded and shows to about 200 travellers what are the deep tones that can produce from the throat.
Elena first gave Luca a pack and after a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here to the bus park next to Porta Nuova station, leave this evening at 23.45 four couriers with destination Monaco, Beer Party" , expected arrival at 6.30.
Three couriers are mainly reserved for Italians, in another travelling only Brazilians.
In a corner of the parking lot the South Americans are singing with the flag in their hands, having already celebrated during the night.
It is so loud, says Marco, that it is not for the Italians.
Marco who wears a long coat with false fur lining and a couple of glasses with the silvery wide stecks belong to him buses.
For five years they've been going to the Oktoberfest, this year there are 3 tours.
The night walk, the day at the party, I'll be back at 22,30.
Nighting would only create unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The cost of 45 Euro includes the trip, the welcome of the toast with the Kaiser beer, made according to Bavarian genuine rules, the sickness fund and the German guide – Marco attended a German course in Frankfurt.
And so at night the buses leave at the time of the Brenner.
There's no beer yet.
Suddenly silence falls on the bus, travellers sleep.
Better so, they'll still need their forces.
They stop at Bressanone and Holzkirchen, where other buses with Italian license plate on the A9 motorway before Monaco take a short break.
When, as expected, Marco's group arrives at 6.30 am at the parking lot near Theresienwiese, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others come together, Marco explains for the last time the attack program.
First, put on the yellow hat.
On it on the left is written "Oktoberfest" next to the internet address of Marco's travel agency: "Knowing.it".
Second: "When they open the doors of the beer tendon means to run!", quotes Marco of the first morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the seats at the bottom of the tent.
"Not before, if we block, and not all the yellow caps sitting on the same benches, divide into the space!"
The mouth costs 8.25 Euro, he screams Marco.
And don't forget to stick around.
"Demonstrate to the security service, that we behave well!
As soon as you leave the places, they disappear!"
Third: "At 22.30 p.m. we meet again here! Understand?"
He's already leaving for the party.
On the street one attacks as follows the yellow berets to the trees, to the road signs and even to a billboard of a large Bavarian popular party.
You want to be ready to beat the retreat.
It is the second weekend of the party, known as "end of the Italian week".
Exact data do not exist, we speak of 50 thousand, who leave to cross the Alps and invade the tendons, it is argued that 10% of visitors come specifically from Italy.
The police of Monaco is strengthened with 7 agents of South Tyrol, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian red cross, which makes a statistics on nationalities, where the Italians come first with 200 medical care in front of the English (about 60 medical care) and Austrians (about 80).
Especially loved by Italians is the trend of the Hofbräuhaus.
1. Sleepless nights for Hypo Real Estate creditors
The German banking system is relatively stable, confirmed the finance minister Peer Steinbrück last week.
It is good that the politician used the word "relative" and also mentioned that the German banking sector is not spared by critical developments.
Because the crisis started on the weekend.
The real estate financier Hippo Real Estate, noted in DAX, gets a billion-dollar credit from a consortium of German banks to protect itself from market turbulence.
An expert in the situation told Reuters Monday, support credits would reach up to EUR 35 billion.
The Hypo Real Estate must only pay interest for the requested party.
Money comes from both private and public banks.
The losses of the Deffa affiliate are at the bottom.
The state financer according to a newspaper article has been refinanced in the very short term – which is no longer possible because of the distrust on the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's reserves had declined by 95% of the EUR 2.37 million, even the share of its own capital declined from 1.6 to 1.45.
Current income and net income from financial affairs fell to 0 compared to last year, the profits from increases in both questions and certain shares as well as the liquidation of credit provisions fell more than 70% of the EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to higher income from the restitution of subordinated compensation costs that come from both the restructuring of the former Depfa Group and the repayment of interest according to the single text of tax laws and business management for business consortia, the negative profit has been fairly moderated with approximately 16%.
The former public financier after being privatised in 1990 had lost in speculation with commercial real estate credits, which were disbursed in the Areal Bank.
Since income in the classic state financing was too low, Depfa committed more to infrastructure projects and to financing joint projects of private and state investors (PPI) and has diversified internationally.
The Hypo Real Estate must now amortize the value of the affiliate, which will have a fundamental material effect on the group's profit and loss account.
The fact is the dividends have been erased.
Already in 2007 they had been reduced by 2/3.
The Hypo Real Estate after the absorption of the Depfa is an important financing of the State and infrastructure.
It is more dependent on market refinancing between banks compared to other institutions because it does not have customer trust deposits.
Due to the collapse of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago the granting of credits between banks largely dried up, because banks accumulate liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs for part of the Depfa’s credit portfolio – about 50 mld. – in the short term, the means of refinancing.
According to Hippo Real Estate's notice, the group's financial needs were covered by the credit for a certain period and the company protected from the influence of international monetary markets for the least non-functioning.
From other sources it is felt that, thanks to the money, the refinancing is secured until the end of 2009.
On the contrary, the Chairman of the HRE Georg Funke Steering Committee said that the HRE Group will not need monetary markets in a short time.
The Bundesbank and the National Financial Supervisory Service (BaFin) are based on the fact that the marketability of the HRE group is still assured.
This is hoped for the shareholders and creditors of the bank.
In view of the dynamics and the impermissibility of the crisis there will be no guarantee.
Funding may not be fully used.
But the opposite is not to be excluded.
After Sunday night the bank learned what it was about to fail, the momentary rescue failed to calm down the souls.
The share rate falls 75% on 3.30 Euros.
They manage the loan courses fairly well.
While front-level debts are almost unmovable, the courses of deferred credits are handed down.
Hits are mainly the loans of the affiliate Württemberg-Hypo understandably the events with maturity beyond 2009.
Before HRE loans seemed to be a speculative alternative investment, now their value must, after the strengthening of the crisis of banks and the institution itself, which with the relief of the Depfa crisis has occurred, be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
Unless the central banks, governments and the less damaged banks are still ready, we can count on an amortisation of the annualities by the deadline.
Or it comes into operation, which nobody ventures to hope for – that the financial crisis will be overcome within the next 15 months.
But it concerns the information disclosed because of partial stateizations the probability almost certainly has become a justified hope.
It will, above all, create long-term investors a few sleepy nights with the decision if they divide by their commitments.
Short-term investors may conclude the carry-over of losses for future payments of the countervailing duty on capital gains.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento-Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16 years old, the first day of the school should show up at Tachibana Highschool, the girls start laughing: German is completely "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas-in the new trading log tells of Japan.
First day of school in Japan
How excited I was.
I also had a hard time going to school.
I dress at the edges of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and I need 40 minutes by train to get to Tachibana Highschool.
I had to find her on my own and fortunately I didn't get lost.
The beginning of the first hour of lesson does not seem to have been fixed as we have in Lower Saxony.
Schoolchildren arrive slowly from 8 onwards, until 8.40 a.m. starts a brief interview with the teacher, the so-called "home room".
But before the class started, it was up to me to introduce myself.
I'm not the guy who talks freely in front of people, plus a class of 40 students.
Since I had not yet the school uniform, I put on an old skirt of the host mother, along with a shirt, blue socks and black leather shoes.
Dressed so I stood in front of the chair and tried to say well: "Sayonara Wohe Sylvana..."- my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and celebrate in a week my birthday.
At that time, I was very happy that I had already begun to learn the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class whispered, ridiculed and made a sign, and I heard the word "Kawaii".
I already knew this one from my Mangas.
It belongs to the essential lexicon of Japanese girls to survive and means "sweet, sweet."
Then I ran fast to my place.
The girl next to me got embarrassed, for her it was an honor to sit next to an exchange student.
The rest of the class time was continued quietly, but when she played the gong, I was roasted in the true sense of the word.
Everything was messy and ridiculous and dried up with questions – then it's really hard to understand the English of the Japanese.
In the break they all opened their Bento.
My host mother also made me the basket for the Lunch- is different from the boring German sandwiches.
I had risotto with spices, sausages, cucumber salad and algae, fruit and a kind of wrappers with meat and tofu..
To tell the truth, I don't even know exactly what I eat in Japan.
Things seem strange and have a completely new taste.
It is done, that everything is really good.
Maybe except the plums put under the salt, Brrr!
The Bentos are not just lunch at Japanese schools.
Sometimes it happens that a girl gives a Benedict made by herself, prepared quite artisticly, with the hope then to get to know the boy during recreation.
I read it in my Manga comics.
I'm really curious if you can find out.
"Why exactly Japan?" they asked my friends when I told them, what would I have wanted to go to school for a year in Japan.
I always said,
"Because it fascinates me"
Finally, I have been reading the Mangas for years with fervor.
And to better understand the comics and culture that they contain, sooner or later I started learning a little Japanese.
I was completely convinced to come here once.
I am also fascinated by tradition, customs and customs.
They're holding us here a lot.
On the one hand, Japan is a place of technology and latest trends - on the other hand: severe, disciplined and traditional.
Since everything is well organized, I have never felt lost, even though Tokyo is the largest city I have ever seen in my life."
1. Rats also have feelings
A rat or a cockroach escapes when they feel the danger.
The neurologist Joseph Le Doux is convinced of this: even many animals have feelings.
4. But how can one find out if, when they behave in the same way, they have our same feelings?
For some years, articles from well-known scientists have been published on the "Edge" Internet newspaper.
6. SPEGEL ONLINE in a series presents chosen answers to the question: "What do you think is true, without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings or other states of conscience, without me or anyone else being able to prove it so far, since we cannot even prove that other men have consciousness.
But in this case we must at least hope that all human brains have the same basic configuration.
9. As soon as we turn to the other species and ask questions about feeling or in general about consciousness, we enter an impracticable territory, because the base of reference does not fight.
When a rat is in a dangerous situation, he does the same things that other animals do. That means he pretends to be dead, he runs away or he attacks.
People behave in a similar way, from which some scientists understand that there is a comparable subjective feeling.
I don't believe that.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult for us to convey our feelings to animals.
On the one hand, the lateral prefrontal cortex is often connected with human awareness, associated circuits (this is due to its direct sharing with short memory and executive and control functions).
In man this vast area is much more developed than in other primates and it seems that among other creatures it is completely missing.
At least in those aspects of our awareness dependent on the prefrontal bark, including knowledge, who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, the basis is thus accepted on the assumption that man differs even from other primates.
Another dramatic detail should be presented in the way of man's speech: since a large part of life is related to language, it is often said to be related to consciousness.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
Although awareness does not depend on language, it would influence it so that the awareness of the animal, as it is done, will certainly differ greatly from the circumstances of our conscience.
That is why it is difficult to find out how consciousness can be seen in other animals.
If it is not possible to measure it as an internal and subjective thing, in analyzing it through its own experience due to special hardware, their research will cause us great problems.
Most interpretations refer to the content of the conscious experience, but apart from this there is another aspect of the consciousness to which for science it would be easier to have access.
We could analyze the processes of animal consciousness without regard to their contents, and this is the case in the short memory studies of primates, particularly in the example of visualization.
Therefore, for this principle, which Christof Koch und Francis Crick follows, first passes to the neural correlates of consciousness rather than to the causal mechanisms: both could be identical but not necessarily.
In an interesting way, this principle also highlights the value of the prefrontal bark for the implementation of the display.
What, then, is illustrated by the feelings?
I charge them with the fact that an emotional system like fear is activated in one of their conscious brain activities.
What we indicate as "fear" is therefore the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, like the reactions of the body) occupies the memory of work.
In this way, feelings are closely linked to the regions of the bark, which characterize the primates and in particular the human being.
With the speaking nature we create subtle nuances of hearing, because we with the help of words and grammar can distinguish and categorize situations, to describe them to others.
Compared to this Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that the feelings result from more primitive activities of the body regions of the sensations of the bark and the scalpel, similar to Jack Pankseep, who nevertheless focused more on paleocephalus.
Since this network in the course of human evolution has not changed much, this could be part of the feelings extended to the species.
On a purely theoretical level I cannot contradict it, but I think it is unspeakable.
Pankseep makes arguments about the fact that what appears to rats and human beings as fear, you probably feel this way in both cases: but how could it happen if rats and human beings feel the same way when they behave in a similar way?
Does a cockroache in case of danger run away as if he also felt fear?
In my eyes, the mere likeness of behavior cannot demonstrate any vital similarity yet.
And that is, neural comparison continues to be helpful: rats and human beings have similar paleoencephals, scars don't even have a brain.
But is paleoencephalus responsible for feelings?
And when we could prove it to the human beings: how would you like to prove it on rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even insects (who knows?), have feelings.
But I didn't know how to prove it.
And because their feelings are fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness is based on specific circuits and language), I prefer to study emotional behavior rather than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, there is progress here at neural level, provided that the same procedure on rats and men is waived.
Since I don't research language and conscience in rats, so I don't do it on their emotions, I don't even know if they exist.
This can be considered as myopic, but I prefer to take steps forward, rather than to slam constantly against a wall.
I'm actually a practical emotional.
President of UEFA Platinum: referral to Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik said that the preparations will soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees the Uefa decision in Bordeaux as a demonstration of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize Europe with Poland," Wasjunik said.
"But this is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still much to be done in both countries"
Both the homeowner countries are floundering in the roadmap for the construction or reconstruction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports.
Eventually, the number of stages to be used for the Europeans will even be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
Now we have to work at the highest speed," said the president of the Ukrainian association Grigorij Surkis.
"the UEFA will keep an eye on us"
An even more radical step has been taken in Poland.
After numerous scandals the management of the Polish association PZPN was suspended by the national Olympic Committee and replaced with independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of the Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There would be "the serious danger that the PZPN is unable to operate according to the rules," Drzewiecki said to the Polish information agency PAP.
"In a letter we assured UEFA President Michel Platini that the preparation for EM 2012 will not suffer from it."
Many members of the first division were sentenced for manipulation only last season, and in the end it was even necessary to postpone the beginning of the League at the last moment.
Dennis Quaid revolt outraged
He wanted to promote a new film, in an interview he talked about the private and now he has grain with the former: Hollywood star Meg Ryan has declared his former Dennis Quaid adultery.
He foams with anger and repeats.
The Roses War is delayed for the former couple of married Meg Ryan und Dennis Quaid: seven years after their separation, the two actors in Hollywood are now fighting each other a bad fight - in public.
Meg Ryan in an interview with the American magazine InStyle last week for the first time expressed himself about the reasons for the failed marriage: "Dennis has long been unfaithful to me, and this has been very painful."
The extent of the traditions she would have come to know only after the separation.
The occasion for the "squeezing of the soul" was the work with Ryan's press for his new film "The Women" – the story of an adultery is told.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his being publicly declared as an adulteress has been clearly stated: it would be "unheard", said the fifty-four-year-old at the "New York Daily News", that "Meg for the next time repeats and reworks the history of our relationship".
It would also be "deplorable" that to Jack, the sixteen-year-old son who had together, again "are publicly reminded of the pain and subvertment, which a separation means for every child."
While Ryan lives alone from separation, Quaid is married again and will soon become the father of twins.
And therefore his judgments are closed with the arrow: "My life in any case goes on.
I think I'm lucky to have a wonderful family that everything goes for the best."
Reduce prices for flight tickets and hotels
In the first half of 2008 flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would be up to 50% cheaper.
Flights and overnight stays in the hotel have become more convenient again - this is the result of a study by the financial supplier and American Express travel.
The company analysed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and after an increase in prices in the first quarter observed a clear decrease in the second quarter.
After prices on the hotel market have increased for years, overnight stays in many places have already fallen in prices.
From January to March prices rise in 41 of the 48 European cities examined still on average around 6.9 compared to 2007
However, from April to June prices were already 3,6 % lower than in the previous year.
The most obvious trend would have been in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay 30 to 37% less than a year earlier.
American Express sees as a reason for this the dollar's weak quote, which would lead to a "warning desire to travel by American tourists"
Financial centres such as Frankfurt and London would also be affected by the recession of hotel prices in a stronger way than industrial centres such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger
In the Norwegian city the prices of hotels with an increase of 26.3% even hold the record in Europe
Also as regards flight prices the trend in the first quarter still stands up:
Due to the increase in kerosene passengers in the Economy Class had to pay on average 7.1% compared to 2007, long-range fuel flights would be up to 29.2% more expensive
From April to June the prices of economic class air tickets fell by an average of 12.5% compared to the previous quarter, in the first class and in Business the price changes were, however, much weaker.
In Germany prices have fallen even more strongly than in other European countries:
From January to March prices had risen by 11,9 %, in the second quarter they fell by 23,6 %.
As for the German domestic flights according to the study, prices have even halved.
The reason for the collapse of prices would be low economic growth on the one hand, explains the company.
The demand in many segments of the air travel market has crumbled.
On the other hand, there would be an agreement on the open skies, which liberalizes air traffic between the US and Europe, an increased pressure on competition.
The critical situation would be the abolition of non-profit sections at the Airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 would have declared failure – only in Europe were 24 airlines.
HSV beats Gladbach for 1 to 0
With a goal and simple methods, Hamburg'sSV becomes a capitolist.
In Borussia Luhukay he still can't find a group of 11 that works.
Here Kristoffer Klein worsens the landing of luck for the national player Marko Marin.
The Gladbach player first entered the game late and failed with a shot on the cross
His message was formulated precisely, passing on his lips convincingly.
He knew he was absolutely right.
"We need the second goal," exclaimed Hermann Rieger in the corridor of the Hamburg arena cabins.
It had not happened much in the catacombs, the game pause was over and most of it sat back in its place.
Rieger has been for almost 3 decades physiotherapist of HSV, enjoys an even greater esteem than certain old players.
And so his warning also found listening in the high spheres.
The assistant coach Cornelius Jol annuited and raised the thumb as a sign of approval.
Cornelius is the brother of the coach-in-chief of Hamburg Martin Jol.
His order must have sounded similar: here is the second goal!
The change of position has not occurred.
"Today not everything was nice to see," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt would also have "wanted more relaxed".
For the 1st to zero Hamburgers must thank the head shot led by Mladen Petric (11) and the fact that many players in Gladbach have not been able to harm the weak players in Hamburg.
"It was a dirty victory," wrote Martin Jol.
The SV of Hamburg this Monday will be 121 years old.
The spectators celebrated already before, in the afternoon of Saturday, themselves, the blue sky on the arena and the shining ranking on the screen, which legitimized their sports society as before the class.
It'll be a birthday without a real party.
"We're able to put it all right," said Marcell Jansen.
It has the feeling, that the provisional certificate from the table is more indicative of the unpredictability of the championship than of the dominance of its HSV.
The team with its new arrivals hired late – the Brazilians Neves und Silva, the defender of the petric door as well as Jansen breathed at the FC Bayern – finds itself slowly, but has not yet been able to shine.
"We need more atmosphere and more Dribbling," Jol relaunches with force.
After the vote was defeated
On Wall Street, fear circulates.
The first news of the failure of the rescue package temporarily collapsed the 700-point Dow Jones.
This was the biggest loss of points in the space of a day in his history.
Later the Down recovered a little more.

In the context of the rescue plan, the financial funds for the holding of so-called mortgage documents had to be allocated
However, the sum must be paid not in one stroke, but by degrees.
By way of reference, the State had to maintain the Aktienoptionsschein of the financial companies, which could be redeemed with an appropriate trend of quotations, in order to reduce the debit for the State's funds.

Dark matter influences the flight of space probes
For years a mysterious phenomenon has created perplexity among scientists: dark matter influences the speed of space probes during the so-called Swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that the general theory of the relativity of Albert Einsteins might not be entirely accurate.
The Ulysses space probe flew through space for almost 18 years.
Because of the fast-frozen fuel pipes, it is now up to you to die from freezing.
Among the scientists for years, a mysterious phenomenon creates confusion – the anomaly of Swing-by
Swing-by is a flight maneuver of space probes, with which they get additional thrust/spin/scrolling in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example Earth.
So probes can save a lot of fuel.
The Euro-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical expedition as well as the Ulysses solar probe.
What has surprised scholars for years now: rockets do not behave completely as they would expect under the law on gravitation.
In fact, you get irregularities in speed.
The probes suddenly become faster or slower.
So far the physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
The year renamed Swing-by's anomaly.
Some experts fear that perhaps even the general theory of the relativity of Albert Einstein, which describes the attraction force of matter with a curvature of space, might not be entirely accurate.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study firmly believes that before Einstein was wrong, and tries to explain Swing-by's anomaly through the so-called dark matter that astronomers have seen in the cosmos.
"Responsible for the anomaly could be the dark matter that might also be very close to the Earth," he writes.
Of the existence of dark matter, space scholars have known only for about 10 years.
From you obviously comes an attraction force, whose effect on the other celestial bodies is visible.
She herself is completely invisible, that is, she does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation of sort, especially no visible light.
According to scientists' calculations, dark matter is at least one fifth of the entire mass of the cosmos.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After 10 days in the hands of their kidnappers the tourists kidnapped in Egypt would be free again, as confirmed by the Italian Foreign Minister.
Sudanese kidnappers had requested several million euros of ransom.
In a shooting before release 6 kidnappers were killed.
In southern Egypt 5 Germans were abducted.
Rescue negotiations are already under way.
Germans are always in the sight of kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are undoubtedly free.
This was consistent with Egyptian state television, Arab broadcaster Al-Arabija and Italian media.
Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the Italian television broadcaster Sky TG 24: "Our citizens and other hostages have been released
We are examining their health status," said Frattini.
The 5 Germans, 5 Italians and a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian escorts would be in good health and safe, reported Egyptian state television.
The 19 components of an expedition in the desert are already on their way to Cairo.
It is still unclear what the background of a shooting took place prior to the release of the hostages: therefore the kidnappers after the indications of an Egyptian public security officer would have been ready for the conclusion of the kidnapping, before the Sudanese army killed 6 of them in surprise.
"The problem had been solved.
They agreed to a ransom," said the official.
It would still be "just trying to take the hostages into delivery", when suddenly "this surprise" arrived."
Sudanese soldiers on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt killed 6 of the kidnappers and captured 2 of them.
The kidnappers had claimed from Germany a ransom of EUR 6 million; the money should have been delivered by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily newspaper "El Masri El Jom" referred to a German intermediary, the liberation of the hostages would have delayed, because the kidnappers feared for their own safety.
According to the report the kidnappers wanted to release women into hostages after the ransom was paid.
The men would have to be held as long as the kidnappers had no safe escape.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to take a position on the report .
The abuse of the stepfather "brought suicide"
Years of abuse by the stepfather led a woman to kill herself, declared a court.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stitians, Cornwall, has been in prison for 6 years after admitting eight cases of sexual assault.
Truro Crown Court learned that he regularly harassed his daughter Stephanie Randle, when she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a note of the confession: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court learned that Miss Randle had killed herself in her house in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she was a child and lived in Coventry, Trerise harassed her and bandaged her before having sexual intercourse, while her mother was out working in a pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to life in Cornwall.
Her daughter went to Plymouth.
But the court learned that Mrs. Randle, who had spent a lot of time volunteering at the National Trust, was tormented by the abuses that had caused her.
In 2006, Public Prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court that Ms. Randle's friends, who had been a very good surfer and cyclist, were "emotionally dead," and had "thundered with life".
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
You think you killed yourself suffocating with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle comforted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a letter of confession that ended: "I tied her up and bandaged her."
"I didn't harass her sexually.
I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "He is an extremely strange fetishist, and for his victim it must have been terrifying, especially when he was only seven years old.
"This unpleasant saga ends with the victim who takes his life away.
Even harder is the fact that if he had not, it would have been difficult for the facts to be finished before the court."
I know the effects Stephanie's father and mother have had on their daughter these years.
"Otherwise she was clearly likely to be a promising and happy young man of success."
The officer who lost the data will be punished.
The Cabinet Officer who left top secret documents on a train in June must be charged by the Official Secrets Act, has learned the BBC.
The man was transferred from the Ministry of Defense when he left two highly classified documents on the train to Waterloo.
The documents were passed to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It is the least delicate of the accusations made under this law and there is nothing to suggest a criminal intent.
BBC Frank Gardner's defense correspondent said the movement would come as a surprise to many of the administration.
"They thought that this was treated internally at the Mod and the Cabinet Office," he said.
The employee, who cannot be appointed, is about to be charged under Section 8.1 of the Act, the clause concerning the safeguarding of information.
The Crown Prosecution Service recommended that the officer should be charged by the metropolitan police because of the highly sensitive nature of his work.
The missing documents contained assessments of al-Qaeda and the capabilities of Iraq's security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken away from his home and taken to a hidden place.
Construction companies face the B&B account
English construction companies could face an account of over £80,000 after the rescue of Bradford & Bingley bank.
The government gave £14 billion to protect deposits of 2.6 million Bradford & Bingley savers.
Interest on that loan will be paid by all the companies that take the money of the savers, including the 59 construction companies.
The Director General of the Building Societies Association (BSA) Adrian Coles said it is "irritating" that companies and their members have to pay.
The 14 billion-pound loan will eventually be repaid when the Bradford & Bingley loans will be redeemed.
But the interest that will grow in the meantime will be paid every year to the 700 financial companies that take deposits, but the interest that will grow in the meantime will be charged every year to the 700 financial companies that accept deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies would be included in that number.
It's annoying that those institutions that have acted prudently are now called to pay part of the account of those institutions that have been far less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company had to pay in proportion to the deposits it had, and that the companies among them had to pay 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will amount to £450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find £81 million to pay for the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, director general of the association of construction companies, told the BBC that he believed it was unfair.
"It is irritating that those institutions that have acted prudently in the home recovery market are now called to pay part of the account of those institutions that have been much less cautious."
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the documentation began in 1945.
"We must examine all aspects in the coming weeks to see what options there are to protect construction societies and their members from what might be a significant account," added Mr Cole.
The interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010 the interest of an entire year will be due and this could be almost twice as high.
Since construction companies are mutual organisations without shareholders, their members end up paying the account through higher rates or lower interest rates on savings accounts.
The milk goes up to 5 pence per litre
People in Jersey are facing the fact that they have to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy announced that there will be an increase in wholesale prices of her milk for an extra of five penny per litre from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after an increase of two penny in February, and comes after a research carried out by a consulting company.
Retailers must decide for themselves whether they want to download the price increase on their customers.
(DANILO) Before the increase in February, the wholesale price changed for the last time in 2002.
Negotiating security for former Prime Minister of Bangladesh
A Bangladeshi court refused a bail request from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which means that you could be arrested when you return to the country.
His lawyers said that the court refused to grant her bail for stealing 50 million taka ($729,700) from a businessman when he was a member of parliament.
The case is one of many allegations of corruption against her.
The long-standing political rival of Sheikh Hasina, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail at the beginning of the month.
The return to Bangladesh of Sheikh Hasina is expected for the coming weeks but his party, Awami League, has asked that the temporary government of the country supported by the military give it first total freedom.
Correspondents say that while you were going abroad for medical treatment on the word, it is not clear according to the terms of your release, if you can remain free when you return to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say he will call the Supreme Court against the order of the High Court.
"The High Court has refused the bail request for Sheikh Hasina claiming that you cannot have the security since you are already abroad on the word for medical care," says his lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We shall file an appeal against the order of the High Court."
His lawyers explain that he needs bail to return to the country to prepare for the December elections.
He expected to return to Sheikh Hasina's home after 17 October, said Sunday a senior leader of the Awami League party.
She was detained last year after the government sided with the military took power, but was released in June, to go abroad to receive medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against themselves.
Fear for the Afghan anti-poly campaign
Almost 200,000 children in Afghanistan are missing the recent immunization campaign due to Taliban-related violence, says the United Nations.
The UN carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces last week.
But it is said that you cannot reach children in the parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
One UN spokesman said that this happened despite the Taliban's promises that they would not attack or hinder thousands of staff carrying the vaccinations.
BSkyB loses the legal battle with ITV
BSkyB lost its legal battle with the decision of the Competition Commission to force the company to reduce its participation in the rival TV station ITV.
BSkyB was told by the competition appeal court to cut its shares in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
Previously, the commission had said that BSkyB's participation hindered competition and allowed unjust influence on ITV.
BSkyB purchased participation in 2006 in an agreement that actually blocked NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trading reported that the acquisition of BSkyB participation in ITV sows doubts about the independence of ITV, making it possible for the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
Virgin's chief, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and Ofcom's regulator opposed the purchase.
BSkyB argumented that forcing it to reduce its ITV stake was unreasonable and a disproportionate remedy - specifically as BSkyB had said it would surrender its voting rights.
New investigation into the case of the U.S. prosecutor
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a special Public Prosecutor to examine the dismissal of nine American lawyers in 2006.
The operation takes place when a case report by the Inspector General of the Department of Justice criticizes the actions of the administrative officers.
The report was critical of the White House, the legislators and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was prompted by the fear that prosecutors would be removed for political reasons.
The public special ministry Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officers questioned during the investigation lied to the investigators in an attempt to hinder justice.
"Series of charges concerning potentially criminal behaviour have not been fully investigated or cleared," Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report.
The assignment of a special public ministry with the power to force witnesses to testify was one of the main recommendations.
The dispute began when nine U.S. prosecutors were removed from their positions by the Justice Department in December 2006.
At that time, the department said lawyers had been fired for failing performance.
But later it emerged that the fired lawyers had not been assessed more dwindling than many other colleagues, leading many observers to conclude that the dismissal had been motivated by the policy.
Some of the prosecutors had been involved in judicial action against high-profile Republican members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate the charge of fraud against democratic voters.
American prosecutors investigate and prosecute cases on behalf of the government.
They can be fired at any time, but they cannot be fired for political reasons.
At that time the head of the Justice Department, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, was in the storm for the dismissals, and at the end he reviewed his position.
A number of other officers in the Justice Department fired themselves.
(The Inspector General's report was very critical in relation to Mr Gonzales' role in the case, saying that he had primary responsibility for dismissals, which had abdicated to his leadership role and had been extraordinarily detached during the trial.
Other officers, including Bush Karl Rove's previous senior assistant, were criticized for not collaborating with the investigations.
The epic of Meat Loaf will be celebrated
The rock star Meat Loaf is about to be honoured at the Q Awards for its epic Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will withdraw his special gold prize at the ceremony next week in London, said he was "honored" to gain recognition.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of Meat Loaf's 1977 album hit track.
The Coldplays will conduct the nominations for this year's prizes, being on the list of nominees in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of the magazine Q, said: "There are some songs that transcend things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is undoubtedly one of those."
The song, composed by Jim Steinman, required a strong vocality that was provided by Meat Loaf.
It was opened with an instrument section that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was realized as a single in the UK in 1979 and reached 15th place.
But the album of Meat Loaf Bat Out Of Hell remained almost nine years in class and came to sell more than 40 million copies in the world.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered from health problems in recent years, including an intervention for an irregular heartbeat in 2003 after collapse on stage.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel the concerts.
Later it emerged that it had a cyst on a vocal cord.
Dark city streets, often forgotten and perhaps soon for sale
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards, roads and other crossings, some famous ones, others merely of use.
But also many veteran taxi drivers and residents for a long time find it difficult to give the position of Extra Place, mostly because they have never heard of it.
The tiny road is in the East Village and goes north from the First Street – without making the Second Street – between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, it looks more like a dusty alley than an active via traffic.
There are no road signs.
It is virtually impossible to see it on a normal athlete.
The road must, however, have admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the real estate company of luxury buildings recently built on the First Street.
You want to reopen Extra Place and create a cleaner passage for shops and boutiques that should open in new buildings.
Other admirers include long-standing neighbors who say they were hit by the truncated road simply because it was one of the last remains of the gentleman's neighborhood of the past.
But the department of preservation and development of the city, which has control of the roads, has no interest in keeping it.
During a meeting of the Committee for the Use of Land of the County Commission of the District some representatives of the city agency and Avalon Bay have drawn up a proposal for the real estate company to buy the streets.
But the committee prefers the road to remain in the hands of the city, and has requested a new plan to be presented next month, says Susan Stetzer, the director of Community Board 3 district.
"There is very little space left to the property of the city, and we would like the city to continue to own Extra Place," he said.
"There could be proposals to fix it and manage it, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want to guarantee public access."
Avalon Bay many months ago announced that he wanted to reopen the small road and install seating places, including some to use for a café to which the real estate company hopes to rent space.
The idea that Avalon Bay would buy the road was made public for the first time at this month's meeting.
Michele de Milly, a spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the road, it doesn't necessarily mean that it wants to own it.
"Avalon Bay's main concern is to renew this loose alley and turn it into a public amenity," he said, adding that the city suggested the sale.
Seth Donlin, a spokesperson for Preservation Accommodation, said that in fact it was the desire of the city to sell the road and pointed out that the purpose of the agency was to develop the property rather than administer it.
In comparison to its most colorful neighbour, Bowery, Extra Place left a slight historical footprint.
Some believe it was named in 1802, when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was divided among his many children and the narrow strip of land was not claimed.
The back door of CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opened on Extra Place, and the road is perhaps better known as the cover photo set of the Ramones album "Rocket to Russia."
"The land was splendid," said Danny Fields, the Ramones manager, who took the picture in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, garments and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves, ropes."
Some residents, including some bloggers writing "gentrification" of the East Village, opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, implying that the public property piece, modest as it is, should remain public.
Others praised Extra Place as a rarity – a city fragment almost for almost nothing changed that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who has a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled, "The Book of Lamentations: A Little Nostalgic Look at the City undergoing extinction"), published part of a City History Speech that appeared on The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow road without exit, dark even by day and delimited doors of rusty iron warehouses and windows with the Sarachinsks, with old newspapers of weeks flying along the bottoms."
With few exceptions, the road looked almost the same as a recent evening.
A rat ran fast through the back of the road near a door leading inside the CBGB, which is now the site of an aristocratic clothing store.
On the walls there were graffiti and a bottle of 22 ounce empty beer lying near a group of fresh abandoned newspapers.
A few passengers said that they rarely thought of Extra Place but suggest that they would need to be a little beautified.
Mr Fields, for his part, said that he also thinks some people underestimate the attractiveness of the road in its present state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "they were in black, dirty and disgusting places."
Bilingual debate: immersion in English
In this educational point of view, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the position of candidates on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, senior member in California studies and senior director of educational studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "Not as good as you think: Because the middle class needs to choose a school."
Attracting Spanish voters really is a complicated business.
Barack Obama's educational projects are a significant example.
Mr. Obama's campaign notes that, "African-American and Latin American students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students," which is true.
To combat these deficiencies in achieving the goals, Obama's educational plan specifically supports, among other things, "transitionary bilingual education" for English students.
Yet the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes teaching in language classes other than English, does not take into account his interest in filling learning gaps.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, a elementary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
School students are mostly Hispanic and low-income.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have recently arrived, are studying English.
But, among the fourth students, a surprising 100 percent of students did the upper-level test in the 2008 math status exam.
An equally surprising 93% of fourth-year pupils did the expert level test on English-language art.
This incredible result has been achieved using a different ingredient than Mr. Obama's favorite one.
Sixth Street emphasizes the review and exercise, constant assessment of skills and an "no excuse" attitude.
Moreover, it is here that Mr. Obama should note, according to Linda Mikels, Director of Sixth Street, the constructive approach of the school for English students is "full immersion."
The use of English emphasizes the almost exclusive use of English in the context of education.
Mrs. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, told me, "we had a fantastic success with a student who just came from Mexico and if you had joined the class 12 months later you wouldn't have been able to identify what it was."
"It works," he observed, "for us it works."
Would Obama take a model school like Sixth Street Prep to replicate it in other Spanish-majority schools and with English students?
The results achieved by the school make the answer to that very easy question, but education policy in its own party (the National Education Associations is a long-standing supporter of bilingual education) and its own continuing support for bilingual education prevents Mr. Obama's response from predicting.
While he agrees that immigrants should study English, Obama recently made the subject trivial when he said that people should stop worrying about the "English-only" legislation.
Instead, he said, "You must be sure that your children are able to speak Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close these gaps, he should carefully consider the educational models that work rather than despise them or trivialize them.
Oil drops sharply and renews economic fear
Oil prices have dropped sharply on Monday because of the concerns that even the American rescue plan for financial markets may not be able to raise the economy.
The future of the crude oil fell from 7% to $99.80 per barrel at the New York Merchant Stock Exchange in the morning operations.
Prices have lost more than $20 per barrel since last Monday.
In the last two weeks, raw materials markets have been shaken by the financial turmoil of Wall Street, and by a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a peak of $145.26 per barrel in June, prices fell to almost $90 at the barrel at the beginning of this month, before going back again, on the background of tremendous uncertainty in financial markets.
Anxiety influenced investors again Monday even after the Congressional leaders had said they had reached an agreement on the weekend about the rescue plan, the largest in history.
The news was obscured by the fresh concerns that the financial crisis was far from over.
In the last episode of the progressive merger, Citigroup will buy the banking operations of Wachovia Corporation, said the government on Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partly nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Barclays Capital analysts said that the frantic weekend negotiations had led to a rescue agreement " seem to have failed to revive the feeling of the market.
As the economic situation worsens, the demand for raw materials, including oil, is expected to calm down.
"The prospect for global equity, interest rates and exchange rate markets has become uncertain," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
"We believe that raw materials will not be able to escape the contagion.
From a raw material perspective our most pressing concern is to what extent the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China."
Bank analysts have lowered their expectations for next year while home oil consumption due to the slowdown in economic growth, reducing the forecast price of oil and gas by about 20% by 2009.
The operation in the second quarter marks a team record.
After spending more time than anyone with the Jets uniform in the last eight and more seasons, defender Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything.
Then he watched it take place on the second Sunday, when the Jets turned a game without points into a rebound.
"Never seen anything like it," said Ellis.
The second fourth began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had equaled the grayness of the threatening clouds that overcame them with a falsified game.
Then the Brett Favre quarterback found Laveranues Coles for a 12 yard touchdown, providing the perfect signal for an afternoon when their growing tune made a huge step forward.
Favre found Coles for another two touchdowns in the fourth, including one when a cornerback fell and another with 10 seconds left at the end of the first time.
"I didn't get out of my path," said Favre of all the steps that came to Coles.
He's a great player.
Our communication has been great, despite what people can think."
While Favre and Coles were playing catch games, the defense severely hit Cardinals Kurt Warner's quarterback.
The cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a vague launch and relaunched it for 32 yards in a touchdown.
Security Eric Smith planned another move and intercepted him.
Linebacker David Bowens forces a Warner fumble.
The last shift, the fumble forced by Bowens, could have been the most remarkable.
The Cardinals took advantage of that ball possession, with 10 seconds left, and after the Jets had resumed the ball with 10 minutes left, Jay Feely kicked a 20 yard goal, for a 34 to 0 advantage.
It was more than the Jets ever scored in a quarter.
When asked to describe his madness, Jets coach Eric Mangini said, "The second or third fourth?"
When he was told both - the Jets gave 21 unanswerable points in the third quarter - Eats said: "I can tell you that I liked the second fourth much more than the third."
There's been a lot of stitches in a small amount of time."
Rested Gebrselassie exceeds its world record
Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia showed again because many consider it the best marathon ever, breaking its own world record at the Berlin marathon Sunday and becoming the first person to run a race of 26.2 miles under 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a victory on the favorably flat race at 2:03:59, Gebrselassie sends in pieces for 27 seconds his previous score of 2:03:26, run last year in Berlin.
At 35 years of age, Gebrselassie has developed the 26th world record of such a dazzling career that has produced a world championship or world record every distance from the metric mile to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie skipped Beijing's Olympic marathon, fearing - perhaps too alarmingly, retrospectively - that air pollution would have worsened its asthma problems.
Instead, he decided to run to Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees on departure, 55 degrees on arrival - Gebrselassie won Sunday with a hot average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
As soon as half of the founders such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya went to long distances, the marathon record fell more than two minutes in the past decade, since Ronaldo from Costa del Brazil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After the Sunday victory, Gebrselassie told the reporters that two weeks ago he had cramps at the pulpits and he missed a week of training.
Clearly, the rest left him fresh, not rusty.
"I'm so happy," Gebrselasie told the reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started over a week ago, and I had doubts today, but in the end everything went well."
He was somewhat criticized - especially in Kenya, the East African rival of Ethiopia - for having excessively orchestrated his races, generally avoiding many of the best marathon stars in the world, counting on aplipistas as if it were a half-fund race, and putting world record over the sense of competition.
But these criticisms rarely diminish the size of Gebrselassie's skills as a marathon.
With the pace of four Kenyans Sunday, Gebrselassie reached the halfway point at 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, held in competition Gebrselassie after the openings disappeared.
Just over three miles from the arrival, Gebrselassie made a final impension to separate from Kwambai, which ended second in 2:05:36, improving his best personal time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi arrived third at 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, native to Kazakhstan who is now a German town, has completed a remarkable year winning at 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time ever.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, Mikitenko, 36 years old, was a surprise winner of the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
The Beijing Games have been lost with what is described as a bad accident, but it is healed to win in Berlin, making its best personal time of almost five minutes in the third marathon that took place.
She ran a race by doing well the calculations, letting a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners leave with a great detachment, taking them back about 18 and a half miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia arrived second in 2:21.31, while Helena Kipprop of Kenya ended third in 2:25:01.
In a separate city, pride and processes of a black life
Hidden in the extensive theme park on the suburbs of Orlando, a few miles from the splendour, noise, enormous, lies the quiet city where the pride and complications of the African-American experience enter into life.
Eatonville, the first black city incorporated into the country and home of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as it described in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, plenty of guava, two schools and no prison."
Now it's a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to Zora's annual! Festival in Eatonville to show their respect for Hurston, Harlem Renaissance's most famous writer.
Yet in many ways, the city that described - and that makes tourists stop including it in the tourist guide of Florida produced by the Depression-era Federal Writers' Project - remains a separate place.
It is so independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted to share their thoughts with white man, who "knowing so little of us, he doesn't know what he's missing."
Even now, in a year where a black presidential nominee, Senator Barack Obama, was called for an opening speech on the race, many here remain suspicious of the outsider's gaze.
"We are very careful about how our story is told," said Hortense Jones, 59 years old, a lifelong resident and member of the city's oldest church.
"It must be fair."
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and difficulty.
It is both a historical model of taking power black and a community of nearly 2,400 where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a literary centre but also an example in the shadow of the oaks of the rural culture of the blacks of the south - sometimes desecrated, sometimes rewarded - born of American slavery.
Not surprisingly, residents here are both proud and protective.
And the concern about Eatonville's image really began with Zora, whom everyone here calls Hurston.
She presented the world to her hometown through sincere books, rich in dialect, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs of Florida's leadership transformed the city, just outside Route 17, a road that runs through the often forgotten center of Florida within a scenario of black history and human drama
Low as a crab in both life and literature, Hurston brought the readers into the shop owned by Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then diverted to more private areas.
"Out of the road to the left," he wrote, "is the modern public school, brown with white finishings, with its well-kept gardens and courtyards, to which Howard Miller always used to care, thinking he could just read and write."
She also mentioned the new husband of the widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and whatever suits the passage rooms."
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston connected Eatonville with self-government but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
Clearly this wasn't from Fodor.
In fact, it was not a portrait that everyone appreciated.
"Zora said it like it was," said Ella Dinkins, 90 years old, one of Johnson's girls that Hurston immortalizes by quoting men who sing coarse songs about their beauty.
He adds: "Some people don't like it."
Hurston is still remembered here as a lively eccentric that frequently returned from his family transferred to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77 years old, remembers that when Hurston rained in the city, he usually arrived unannounced in a triumphant Chevrolt, smoking and wearing pants in a city that even today boasts dignified clothing.
Many people were fascinated, says Mr. Franklin, while others were squealing.
"People were always very happy to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But, he added, swaying on his chair on the patio on the back of Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "he never remained for long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books had gone out of the press.
Together with the rest of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in a tomb without plaque in Fort Pierce, Fla., where she had lived.
In Eatonville, there were no great commemorative ceremonies, and no great conference.
"I don't think they understand his contribution to the world or his legacy to all," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a biography of Hurston published in 2003.
A change occurred in the 1980s.
Orange County officials wanted to place a five-way highway across the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the main two-way road.
Orlando's expansion has already pushed La Interstate 4 through the western border of the city.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult time in his history.
Forced integration, in addition to other things, had put an end to its idyllic isolation of the community
In the 1950s, the battle on racial mixing brought hatred on the door of the community's house.
"During that time, a group of white boys came and threw oranges and things at people sitting on one side," says Mr. Franklin.
"We actually had a girl who was killed once.
They threw a cake out of a car."
In a letter dated 1955 to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston made a request for forced integration to the Supreme Court, defining his decision in Brown against the school office "an insult rather than an honor for my race".
Residents now say that the breakdown of schools, despite having been positive in some respects, dilutes Eatonville's cohesion and endangers the confidence of its young people.
"Black children were used to being hugged - I remember this - you embraced your teacher in the morning, you embraced your teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, Ella Dinkins' daughter and the Executive Director of Preserve the Eatonville Community, a non-profit group.
This lasted, he added, until teachers and students came from the same place.
"You didn't hug your white teacher because your white teacher...- I mean, there's a cultural division there," Mrs. Nathiri said.
Civil rights, however, helped and created space for many other Zora Neale Hurstons - black writer, actress and artist who overcome prejudices, as he did, with cheerful self-confidence and lines such as: "How can some deny themselves the pleasure of my company!
I just can't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker began a long journey towards the tomb without the Hurston plaque and began to fight for the resurrection of her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography about Robert E. Hemenway hit the shelves of the bookstores, reintroducing it into the American canon.
The highway project came just as her most famous daughter had turned the lights back on.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The community began to design a festival dedicated to Hurston in 1988 to show what could ruin the state with its highway.
Thousands of fans came to the inaugural event two years later, and every January many return for the commemoration.
Many years later, the state withdrew from its road project.
"The five lanes of the Risen Highway have brought what would be called high speed, a real pride for the city," said Ms. Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd puts it more simply: "Now saved Eatonville."
The victory over the highway project helped to change the image the city has of itself.
Those out of town like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began to come to church here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and residents began to reconsider the past.
Eatonville was added to the public historical register in 1998.
A new one-storey library (called Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on a renovated and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly of Florida: only six miles from the centre of Orlando, can give the feeling of a secondary road under the summer rain, small as when it was founded with just 27 black families in the 1980s.
(It's 90% black today.)
The outsiders who come to search for Eatonville's story, for its meaning, are often still cautiously treated.
A permission requested in advance is required for most of the interview, to some things - like the murals on the oldest church in Eatonville, painted by a white man, who show black men in the fields - do not have permission to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Ms. Jones, a fat teacher, with a weakness for the bright red, still fear that their island community will be misunderstood.
Yet, as soon as the Hudson festival expanded, a high level of citizen pride emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville with Hurston saw its entire race: beautiful, problems and everything, no better, nor worse and fair, creative, great worker, dumb and confused like other races and ethnic groups in America.
It is sincere civic affection what can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's grandson Edwin Harvey, 18, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or the Police Department, who said he might need help.
And even those who are younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Many people, if they just got in here, they'll think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others," said Alondra Kenon after the Mass on a recent Sunday.
"But if you really stop and take a moment to look at history, it's really a pretty town."
Here in New York we all talk fluently about finance
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the newsstands and the huge TV screens of Times Square, they would not notice being in the eye of the cyclone.
They would never guess that the glass offices, nested with bees above their heads, the bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York live every day the worst "bad day in the office" since the collapse of 1929.
Farmers shake metal reels for the the through the sidewalks, carrying muffin trays for breakfast meetings.
Latin-Americans drag their feet between condominiums carrying, like human mules, 50 and stretched shirts hung on a stick on their shoulders.
The employees are still waiting in line for their morning bagel to the food carts on the sidewalks, and it is still impossible to take a yellow taxi between 16 and 19 of a working day.
It did not seem that there was a real crisis, until, with all the speech of ruin and sadness, I decided to open a new savings book on Thursday afternoon.
Although I had planned the matter so that it coincided with the late afternoon break at my branch of JP Morgan Chase, a tail of about twenty was already waiting in line.
Not in front of the cashier's office, to withdraw money or make deposits, but in front of the customer service's office, where old customers order cheque books, tourists ask directions for the big Macy warehouse and new customers open accounts.
Many of those who are in front of me, I would have learned from Starr, my "banker of trust", were in line for my same reason.
Unlike me, however, they have already taken savings from the smaller banks from the places from which they make commuters, such as those from New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They took the money from the so-called thrifts (a bit like a construction company), credit cooperatives and types of city savings banks whose subsidiaries operate only within a state, and say they treat customers as family members.
In the past few years, 15 of these banks have failed.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, was submitted to the controlled administration, and while the New Yorkers headed home for the weekend one Friday afternoon, another bank, Wachovia, with savings deposits of $440 billion, was looking for a buyer who saved it.
The employees and commissioners who stood in front of me, scared for another collapse, were moving their money to a bank perceived as a safe port, the bank that is asking for more security on Wall Street.
Common New Yorkers in recent weeks have become competent in finance.
A woman in my trusted Chinese supermarket, speaking on the phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the bank went bankrupt, and to his ecstatic CEO Dick Field in full familiarity, as if complaining of a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the door in uniform, almost fifty years from my condo, has changed the theme regarding our normal topic of conversation about Brad and Angelina or the delivery of my expenses.
She told me, after my visit to the bank, "Now I have all my savings in market funds!.
I've changed, I'm not taking any chances."
Desecrated Muslim Tombs while Austria turns right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, on the left of the Austrian right wing of the Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right party Vlaams Belang, participate in a demonstration to present the organization "Città anti l'Islamisation" in Antwerp, Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry signs like road signs representing mosques with a red line passing through the middle.
The police blamed the extremists on the right for desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same week that the political parties on the far right gained much from the national general elections.
More than 90 graves have been seriously damaged at the Traun cemetery, near Linz, in a few hours between Friday night and this morning, in which the police believe it was an organized action.
The culprits traced with the spray Jewish symbols like the Star of David over some graves, but detectives believe it could have been an attempt to mask extremist motivations led by hatred for Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the accident is somehow linked to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the desecration, which took place toward the end of Ramadan, a month of religious importance for Muslims.
In the meantime, Austria embarked on a spiritual search trip following its right turn in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two extreme right-wing parties that took almost 30% of the votes, the Austrian Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, campaigned with a vehemently anti-immigration ticket and some of their slogans were defined by xenophobic critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the votes, campaigned against sails and burkas and also expressed his opposition to foods that are perceived as related to Islam.
At the final meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties seem to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, implying that they are political symbols of a continuous Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses made immediately after the elections, which have established the extreme right as the nation's strongest political bloc, indicating that the change was brought predominantly by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
I'm traveling abroad banned from Gary Glitter.
Gary Glitter, the glamorous rock star guilty of sexual abuse of minors, was forbidden to travel to France and Spain by the court.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after they informed the authorities that they wanted to go to Spain by way of France.
The ban on travel abroad was granted to Kent police last Thursday after he had provided magistrates with evidence of prior arrest of Glitter for sexual abuse of minors.
Glitter, true name Paul Gadi, was not present at Ashford's court hearing in Kent but was represented by Corker Binning's lawyers.
A spokesperson for the Court Service said: "Thursday, 25 September at Ashford's Pretoria, Kent police filed a request to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd's journey abroad to France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd was not present in person."
Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad as requested by the register of convicted persons for sexual offences.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
He is also asked to give the police a seven-day notice on his scheduled date of departure.
Failure to notify the authority may lead to a sentence of five years in prison.
Kent's police said they don't want to discuss individual cases or possible Glitter's move to the country.
A Kent police spokesman said: "Kent police will do everything they can to protect children in this country or abroad.
"From our point of view, it is easier to control someone who remains in the UK because we have suitable comprehensive systems to manage any potential risk more effectively.
"Protecting Kent residents is the main concern of Kent's police and we work closely to monitor the behaviour of convicted persons for sex offences registered in the country to minimize any possible risk to the public.
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two girls aged 10 and 11.
When Glitter came, he flew to Bangkok where he had to board a flight to London.
But he said he felt sick and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities would not have moved him to passport control and eventually took a flight to Hong Kong.
Even the Chinese authorities did not let him in and returned to Bangkok where the Thai police and immigration officers insisted that he return to England.
Eventually he arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on 22 August and remained there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge Pretoria, west of London, since Scotland Yard had successfully applied for an order to place him in the register of convicted persons for sexual crimes.
Glitter had previously been imprisoned in the United Kingdom in 1999 for possessing images of child abuse.
A source of the Ministry of the Interior said that Jacqui Smith, the Secretary of the Interior, was reassured and happy that Glitter had been stopped from travelling to France and Spain.
"I photograph the master away from the scene to extract the character" Günther Bauer, photographer
Neither heels nor steering wheel nor clothes from before.
Only the essence of the great masters of flamenco, stripped of the concentration that characterizes the interpretation, to look at the relaxed appearance of man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Two inseparable faces, except in the private, in those moments away from the public, when the intimacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of hands, are natural because they must not go on stage.
German Günther Bauer in "Flamenco-People" alternates the theatricality of some shots to singers, dancers and guitarists on stage with the less known side of these masters.
With this objective, the photographer offers an original flamenco iconography, taking it from different visual angles.
The exhibition, included in the programming of the Month of Flamenco Photography, reflects the international importance of this dance, every day ever greater," explains the artist and clarifies that in "Flamenco-People" it could also be ordinary people, but seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists, performers or performers on the scene.
These people depicted "on the road" are "artists able to transmit passion, sadness, joy when they are on stage ... and capture the audience.
To capture the personality of these great ones it is not necessary to portray them on stage,
because their personality and character are internal.
What I was interested in was creating an intimate atmosphere that allowed me to capture with the camera the personality of the great flamenco."
With the passion for the festival "Cante de las Minas", Bauer began in 1997 a long journey aimed at depicting singers, guitarists or dancers using a plate camera.
They are portraits that, because of the type of machine and the material, remember classical photography.
The application of various stylistic techniques breaks with the traditional principles of the image, conferring on the modernity photo, according to an idea that reflects Bauer's own flamenco conception: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and is able to surprise every day."
Not dancing, singing or playing in itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, able to conquer the audience with his art.
The search for a meeting with the essential elements, with the magic that becomes visible in a certain way of feeling and being, are and have been the constant of this work, in exposure these days at the gallery El Fotomata.
Famous flamenco artists such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are in this selection of about seventy artists portraits.
The project has become a kind of flamenco anthology, and will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits exhibited during the exhibition.
The passion for portraits led Bauer to repeat the idea two years ago with "PortARTproject Portraits of Veteran athletes".
Although in "Flamenco-People" the concept is different, the photographer admits "I love to portray people, to know them and to be able to penetrate for a moment into their lives, whether this is a long or short moment.
I think the portrait is the most difficult genre in photography.
You meet or confront people, characters you don't even know or give you only a few minutes to take the picture.
Beyond these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to put my ideas into practice."
The collection of portraits of the contemporary flamenco, entitled "Flamenco-people" is set up at the gallery El Fotomata, at the number 20 of Via de la Mata, parallel to Via Alameda de Hercules, and will be open to the public until the next 16th October.
Vargas Llosa reveals that the novel he's writing is a "lucky"
It is set in places that still do not know and deals with unknown topics: despite this, Mario Vargas Llosa is being taken up with a new project he is working on, a novel whose protagonist, Roger Casemant, is an Irish nationalist who has lived in Congo for twenty years and has crossed Amazonia.
Since he has always been a favourite for the Nobel Prize for Literature, the writer confessed yesterday at the Hay Festival in Segovia, that the project he is working on today "is a daring" and that "everything indicates that I should not write it."
"If I had good sense, I wouldn't write it, but I will also do it and hope to finish it as soon as possible," he concluded his speech at the festival for the exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that for four days he saw passed through the city of the Aqueduct a hundred writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "La cità y los perros" was, as predicted, the prominent figure at the third edition of the word festival.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival prize to be the most voted writer by the participants – an ancient edition of Dickens' "Our Mutual Friend" book, filled the places of the Juan Bravo theatre.
Presented by Felix Romeo, the writer found himself in front of an audience who flew the time when the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with great doses of humor, recalled how he was born the literary vocation, derived from the "extraordinary adventure" of the "pleasant to read" and "to live beyond what I lived"; as he writes in "disciplined mode" to beg for the "lack of inspiration", with an intense work of documentation, writing and continuous remaking; as Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas influenced his vocation and as "the images of memory" are the basis on which they put his stories.
The Spanish-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if books can change people's lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is a pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience," said Vargas Llosa, claiming that, on the contrary, it has "effects" and that "makes people more anti-conformist." That is why he invited writers to "do not give in to frivolity" and "take responsibility" of their own vocation.
The time hinders the Festival of Pozoblanco, depriving it of the races
The celebration of the races that should have sealed the days of the Pozoblanco Festival was suspended yesterday morning, after the towers selected for the races had verified that the conditions of the square floor were not adequate.
Therefore, the company, in agreement with Fermin Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernandez, decided to suspend the celebration of the race.
The weather has rushed against this Festival, preventing you from celebrating two days in three.
Saturday, the rain prevented the run-off of the second race of bulls.
Jose Luis Moreno, Curro Diaz and Juan Bautista, who were supposed to face a bull of Castilblanco, were on the signboard.
Therefore, the Festival had regular performance only on Friday.
On this occasion it was Daniel Luque who triumphed, cutting three ears and coming out in triumph, after having toasted with taste and aesthetics.
The same afternoon Alejandro Talavante completed his two races with greetings and an ear, given more by the public than by virtue of the race itself.
The worst of all was El Juli, passing the Los Llanos arena without glory and without pain.
With the second bull, after a tremendous crutch, the whistles of most of the public were earned.
A van with two thousand pounds of hashish exceeds the block space in Alava
Five minus ten in the morning.
Agents close the elevator to the two occupants of a van that instead of stopping on the run.
The agents have intruded the elevator to the two occupants of a van that instead of stopping at the escape.
Their load, more than two tons of hashish, is a good reason not to stop.
The agents after pursuing them manage to arrest one of the two occupants, a man about 28 years old, identified as A. A. J., as reported in the communiqué of the Department of Interior of the Basque Government.
The arrested individual is accused of drug trafficking and forgery of public documents.
The accident occurred when some road officials in Alava were carrying out a transport check on the N-1, at the point where it crosses the municipal district of Armiñón.
They were about to stop a van for inspection when the driver, transgressing orders, accelerated sharply and passed the blocking place.
The agents were followed up until the vehicle, after a couple of kilometers, stopped on the edge of the road and its two occupants fled into a forested area.
The agents of Ertzaintza were thus able to arrest one of the fugitives and kidnap the 2,178 kilograms of hashish that carried and took note of once inspected the van, a Iveco Daily.
The hashish panels, which were in the rear of the vehicle, were subsequently placed under police custody for a thorough investigation and weight detection.
Moreover, since officials found that the registration had been "doubled" since it did not coincide with the one reported in the documentation of the van, the arrest was also charged with the offence of falsification of public documents.
Ertzaintza is continuing the investigations to arrest the second suspected person, who managed to escape as already said, and to determine the origin of the drug seized.
The 28-year-old A. A. J. was taken to the police station to carry out appropriate procedures and be available to the judge in the next hours.
Arrested actress Heather Locklear for driving under the effect of drugs
The actress Heather Locklear, Amanda of the popular Melrose Place series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the effect of drugs.
One witness saw him perform risky maneuvers while trying to get out by car from the parking lot in Montecito, according to what was revealed to People magazine by a spokesman for the California road.
The witness specified that around 4.30 p.m. the Locklear "lighted down the accelerator, making a lot of noise, and trying to get the car out of the parking lot with sudden maneuvers forward and back. Doing the reverse, he passed several times in front of his sunglasses."
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who at first glance apparently had not recognized the actress, saw that the Locklear had stopped on a nearby road and had left the vehicle.
She was this person alerting emergency services, because "she was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which partially blocked the road.
"It seemed confused," and for this reason the agents led him to a specialized center for drug use and alcohol to test her.
According to a police spokesperson, the actress has shown herself to be collaborative and the hypothesis of excess alcohol has been discarded since the beginning, even though "according to what the officers observed at first, we believe that Locklear was under the effect of some drug."
The Locklear was arrested with suspicion of driving under the effect of some not better specified substance and was locked up in the local prison around 7 p.m., to be released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear was restored by a specialized clinic in Arizona after being hospitalized following an episode of anxiety and depression.
Callazares urges the Andalusian Federation of the UI to assume its responsibilities in the case of Silva
The general coordinator of the IU and member of the party Izquierda Unida, Gaspar Llamazares, confirmed today that it will be up to the regional federation of training to make a decision on the case of the former adviser to Youth and Sport of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week following the accusation of clientelism.
"In these cases I am particularly federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization to assume its responsibilities," said Lalamares as regards the resolution that the party will have to adopt in relation to what has so far been the advisor in the Council of Seville.
However, the IU leader stressed the need for "transparency" in all possible investigations regarding the irregularities that Silva would have committed. "The UI has always wanted this type of investigation to have maximum transparency."
Similarly, he stressed that training is regulated by "very strict ethical codes for all public positions."
"Sangre de maggio", the epic bet of Garci
Inspired by Episodes Nacionales by Benito Pérez Galdós, Jose Luis Garci reproposes in Sangride de maggio the famous Spanish revolt against the French, in what is the most ambitious film of his filmography, with almost 15 million euros of budget.
With this film, the director tried to "illustrate the stream of characters and at the same time the social analysis" that he always admired in the work of the famous novelist, explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutierrez and Paula Echevarría, head of a large cast of performers.
Blood de maggio, longer than two and a half hours, debuts this Friday in the cinema halls, to become a television miniseries of more than four hours on TeleMadrid in the future.
Great admirer of Galdós literature, Jose Luis Garci claims to have realized with this film "a dream of his childhood", and considers it necessary to thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the community of Madrid had commissioned him three years before turning a memorial film for the second centenary of May 2nd. The director had agreed that the story of basing on the novel Episodes Nacionales.
The 15 million budgets allocated entirely by the Madrid Community have represented for Garci a "unique opportunity" to recreate the appropriate scenery and costumes to portray a "a foolish Spain that mistaken the choice of the leader to fight for and the fact that the struggle for independence led to a huge delay in development under the kingdom of Ferdinand VII" observed Garci.
However, the director regrets that he did not receive funding equal to those of Alatriste or Los phantoms de Goya - more than twice as much as Blood de May, so it was not possible to turn some scenes provided by the screenplay he himself had signed together with Horacio Valcarcel, a collaborator of almost all his career.
This, for the director of Return to begin, influenced what is his usual practice of work, the setting up with the actors, with whom he often uses to try before turning together with those who will not be part of the cast, because he considers it "humble," considering that "part of the director's work resides in going to theatre and to cinema to know what is happening in the field in which he works."
Many of the performers, some of whom fall into the cast of Blood of May, try in front of his car, as in the case of Michael Rell, Carlos Larranaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
Candidate for the Oscar for four times - winning one - Garci believes that none of the three films candidates to represent this year Spain at the Academy of Hollywood - its Blood of May, Seven tables de billiard French and, the last selected Los sunflowers blinds - do not represent the youngest generation of Spanish cinema "which should instead be known."
Garci doesn't expect prizes from this movie.
"At first you believe you work for posters, then you realize that you only work for prosperity, and at some point you conform to just filming an extra movie," Garci explains after more than 30 years of career.
Isabel Bayon rediscovers the Seville essence of the Ballerina Tortola Valencia
A Sivilla dancer pays tribute to another Siviglia dancer likewise.
Carmen Valencia Tortola, Catalan father (Florence Tortola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the district of Triana, and at the age of three moved with the family to London.
She was a free dance dancer and an Oriental dance specialist.
He led a fascinating life and was a pioneer of female emancipation, of the caliber of Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was Buddhist and vegetarian, and defended the cause for the abolition of the corset that prevented women from moving freely.
The life of this woman, who marked a revolution in dance and aesthetics in Europe between the two wars, has always fascinated Isabel Bayon.
"I would have enjoyed working with Pepa Gamboa and she offered me this character.
The ballerina supports: "We do not intend to tell her whole life, but collect her spirit.
The titles of his dances suggested some basic elements of flamenco.
So, "the butterfly dance" suggested a guajira, or "the snake dance" some tanghi.
His dance was sensual and I was told that my way of dancing is also part of this aesthetic," he explains.
The show includes two outstanding contributions: that of Miguel Poveda, who will sing again Isabel in one of his shows, as he does in "The Open Door"; and that of Maïlde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work with the one who had been his pupil.
"Matilde interprets adult Tortola, the character of maturity.
I am happy because you have agreed to work in my work and I feel very honored about this."
The setting also includes the musical composition and guitarists such as Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, the song of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga y Moi of Morón; the percussions of El Pájaro, as well as the rape of Rafa La Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfran Juárez "who interprets the role of eternal companion of these artists who have been given to everything round, and who have always had many scary."
In the work there is also in some form the life of this woman who takes place in distant places, especially for that time, such as India, the United States or Russia, and then all of Europe, since it usually lived in London.
"I wanted to remind you, because I think it's one of the women who have had a huge influence in a given historical period and now nobody remembers it and much less considers its work as something of value" says Bayon.
The show will start today, at 8.30 p.m. at the theater of Lope de Vega.
With the publication of the "Diary of a newly married poet" the Triennium also closes
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado" at the church of Saint Stephen (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities scheduled by the Councillor for Culture of the Council of Andalusia to celebrate the "Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramon" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize for both literature and death.
Thus, the "Trienium of Zenobia and Juan Ramon" concludes with the re-editation of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum House and with the travelling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: Aquel Chopo de Lumino", which was inaugurated last May and which, after having touched the various provinces of Andalusia, will be expected to arrive in New York in conjunction with the International Congress.
In addition, the Councillorate to Culture of the Council of Andalusia has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado", by Pietro Tabernero and illustrated by James Perez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and work of one of the most valued Andalusian poets.
America likes a little less without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of these."
The sentence is that of actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Ausencia de malicia" and gives the idea of the impotence of American cinema, and of all America, in the face of the shocking idea that Newman has left.
Yet it cost him a lot to deliver an Oscar to him.
And since 2007 he's been retired.
And it was also known that he was very sick.
Despite this, it was a very hard blow for everyone.
"Sometimes what one proves goes beyond any expression, and now I have lost a great friend," cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country have been better due to its existence."
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
A father of cinema and homeland died in a particularly dark moment, for the fear of terrorists and markets, with the self-esteem of the American people on the ground, in desperate search for new motivations to feel worthy.
When times are so difficult, men so without virtue and there are good people to admire, it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For everyone, he embodied the ideal platonic of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and defender of lost and won causes, from the foundation for the fight against drugs created in honour of the first child died of overdose to the creation of the brand of domestic and biological food.
All gifts to a country at which it was very costly to go beyond a suicidal food culture.
The wave of admiration went beyond Hollywood, without taking care of neither nationality nor passports.
The last James Bond, English Daniel Craig, observed that a man didn't die, it's over a time.
Another Englishman, Sam Mendes, awarded Oscar director, said that working with Newman was nothing less than the peak of his career.
The bad boy who arrived from Australia, Russell Crowe, ventured to call Paul Newman his greatest inspiration.
"He has left an example of a very high level for all of us," says George Clooney, perhaps one of the few today who tries to live as Paul Newman did: keeping in high consideration the need for justice and having a serious private life away from cameras.
This is not always easy or possible in today's media jungle.
However, some try us and Paul Newman is a good example for them.
He divorced once but remained married for fifty years with Joanne Woodward, to whom he remained faithful even though he surely lacked the opportunities to be not.
"Why am I going to eat out burgers today, if I have a steak at home?" he used to joke.
In heaven he is accompanied by the pride that on earth his daughters are also his admirers, which is not so common in America.
"Of all the great roles he played, of no one was as proud as that of devoted husband, loving father, solicited grandfather and passionate philanthropist," they say.
The imperfect race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that sooner or later the Olympics will be held in Madrid and, after the failed attempt for 2012, this could happen in 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday's race, I'd say no!
They called it the "perfect race", but in my opinion it was by far the worst thing I've ever seen.
A lot of nonsense, which if they were subsequently taken into account at the time of the evaluation and I had to examine them, the answer would be absolutely negative.
But let's go by order and start from the beginning.
The nonsense started with the removal of the dorsal, which assumed that it would go before.
It didn't seem to be a bad idea, but if you're forced to go, that's to withdraw everything (including the chip to avoid codes during the race).
Not at all.
You had to go only to take the back (first nonsense, go only for this) and (after the relative tail), surprise! they had only size 'S' shirts (second nonsense, because I need an XL size).
What world do we live in?
Is it the fault of the crisis if they have decided to buy only small shirts, made with less fabric and therefore less expensive?
Well, things like this are inescapable compared to the same day of the race.
In addition to having to go very soon to take the chip, the queue waiting was 15 minutes and, moreover, you had to deposit the backpack.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a race to which more than 11,000 people are expected.
So, as expected, the race began that we had not even deposited the backpack yet, although, once successful in the business, recovery was even worse.
In addition, the rain threatened the waiting for more than 40 minutes, to which attempts of popular rebellion and assault were added to the stand.
In at least 500 people tomorrow we will definitely have pneumonia, and some, like me, will not even be in correct order because of the chip that, I suppose, did not correctly record arrival.
In the future, if they ask me about the perfect race, this will certainly not enter my thoughts.
So I think we'll continue to dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft search receiver (virtual)
At the MlT conference on emerging technologies, Microsoft presented in advance a new system of recognition of image and human interaction, a sort of artificial intelligence, but without much intelligence, able to perform some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or, in the case illustrated by Microsoft, a shuttle service to move within the company campus) assisting the phone user.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this "receiptist" is able to know how many people are in a room, who are - including remembering their position in the company - and to listen and understand the keywords in a conversation with them.
You can also group those present in conversation groups.
In the video for example, the receptionist detects a third person, but understands that he does not belong to the group he is talking to and is not an employee of society.
She asks if she is there to visit someone and tells her that she will be at her disposal shortly.
All without blue screen.
Impressive.
But this, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better to focus on, for example on the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week we talked a lot about a change of strategy in Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer discovered that if computers were equipped with essential functions and less loaded with commercial garbage, they would go five times faster – hey! Steve, it will be for "the least".
All a discovery, if you consider that Microsoft, version after version has continuously added to Windows functionality and "extra".
The change of direction is appreciable.
Microsoft is right: the operating system is losing more and more importance, and with it the software.
When Google launched Chrome into the network, I was one of those who supported the theory that was Google's first step to compete with Windows.
Many rightly point out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is an essential element for hardware and software to communicate.
You perform the same function as your wife or husband when you have something to say to your daughter-in-law.
It's true.
It will never disappear, but perhaps it is necessary to think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute but relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People pay less and less attention to the operating system, and more and more to the Web browser.
You only take the computer to launch Explorer or Firefox - or Chrome - and daily we spend more time browsing online than in a remote window environment.
What are half of the operating system applications used for?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less overload, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services to provide a valid alternative to Google.
They have a desperate need, in fact, and I bring back a small example here.
I took the photo inserted in this post in one of the recreation venues for Microsoft employees in Redmond at the beginning of this month.
On the drink machine a sign prompts them to use their own search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees use Google to do network research.
Last week, however, the delay in developing the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was confirmed.
It will not be put on the market in the first months of 2009, but probably at the end of the year, if not even in 2010.
Microsoft will definitely try to jointly launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The cell phone, after all, is becoming more and more a computer.
But the delay, with Android and iPhone already on the market, is criminalizing.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso took her to the Blue Coast, Leonardo di Caprio shined in Edward Zwick's 'Diamante de sang', as well as Al Pacino and Francis Ford Coppola's 'Ford Coppola' as well as being part of the typical uniform of the gay muscular parish.
And if we try to list the appearances of stars, we can re-enact the image of the force with the pointed mustaches that lift the weights in the moving circus.
This is basically the typical men's shirt, with the cotton inside, strapped and without sleeves.
It is the 'tank', as Anglophones call it, although Belgian Fabulous Marcel stands out above all.
The "Marcel" excels compared to the others for the high quality of cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive coat and for the small Belgian flag (just recognizable), which the most emblematic models of the shirt carry as detail on the neck.
The "Marcel" excels compared to the others for the high quality of cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive coat and for the small Belgian flag (just recognizable), which the most emblematic shirt models carry as detail on the neck.
And be careful, because the production of the Belgian company is not just about the famous "tank".
It also includes college sweatshirts, retro boxer, cashmere cardigan, cotton pants, sailor's shirts, baby-dolls, mini shorts...
Intimate clothing designed to be comfortable.
And it's a shame to use them as underwear.
They're too beautiful.
"I want to be a young mom, the candidate doesn't worry me"
The big resemblance with the sister did not prevent her from developing her personality.
Monica Cruz is small, but full of vitality.
At present, the Cruz sisters have taken their new fashion activities very seriously.
For Monica, they are much more than beautiful girls and celebrities who give their name.
It was in Paris for the promotion that the signature Mango made of its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important prizes that the Spanish fashion house sponsors.
Warm and shy, you win fast.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that we created my sister Penelope and I for the autumn-winter season of Mango, as well as to participate in the presentation of the second edition of the Mango Fashion Awards and at the dinner at the opera in honour of Valentino.
Let's say, a very intense day, but at the same time, exciting.
From what elements does your new collection for Mango start in this fourth working season for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and I like the movies of the '50s is 60, from here we get various inspirations.
Then, I love to lose myself in the city and observe how women dress, how they combine and mix their clothes. I often do so.
Ballerina, actress and designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, even though at the end of the day everything converges and there are many elements in common.
As a child, I liked the clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to frugate into my aunt's closets and see her clothes.
It was a bomb, even better than going to the playground.
Then, when I was a dancer, I always paid much attention to the dress.
It is known that dancers really like to have their own style to go to class and essays, to look at themselves in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress, when they deliver you the wardrobe is the moment you actually meet the character.
So everything goes together, yes, with great respect for designers and professionals.
Not long ago, you turned 30, you went into a crisis?
But no.
Never felt better, I like the idea of 30 years.
I find that at that age women are mature and have a good experience to taste life by making less mistakes.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I've done the things I wanted since I was a kid and this has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So you think you're gonna be a mother or not?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother because my own body asks me and I also want to be a young mother, this I don't want to miss.
As for the candidate, I don't care too much.
What I'm going to do is give my son a lot of happiness and educate him with a lot of love.
As far as cinema is concerned, you are waiting for several films to appear in different rooms last year.
That's right, and I really want them to go out.
Being a woman who comes from the theater, I am very impatient and restless, I would like everything right away and clearly, but it cannot always be so.
I want you to escape "The Last Hour" and "In search of the tomb of Christ."
Let's see if you'll like it.
A few days ago you made a debut on the walkway with Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like you were in the bridge as a model.
Just Naomi Campbell, who I have known for a long time, called me to invite me to London to participate in a charity show for her organization "Women for a better world" and the clothes we exhibited – I brought two pieces of our collection for Mango - were auctioned to collect funds for this NGO of Naomi.
People don't know this tender side of Naomi.
So many things are said about her that I know her for a long time can confirm that I'm not that true.
Besides, I find this good part in which you are involved.
He asked me to parade for a noble cause, but if he asked me to make the pine, I would have done the same.
If it's to help the women of the third world, you can't pull back.
Alcoholic recidivism drivers will have to install the "alcoholock"
The Ministry of Internal Affairs requires drivers with three administrative penalties for excessive alcohol in their blood, to install in their car the system that prevents driving the vehicle in a state of drunkenness or if it does not blow into the device.
The measure was announced last June and is already included in the annual report of the State Attorney General's Office, according to which it will be a one-year pilot project.
The purpose of this project is to reintegrate the driver, since it will have to attend a rehabilitation course on the road.
In addition to the Procura Generale for Road Safety, this initiative will be attended by the Directorate General for Traffic (DGT) and the Foundation Institute for Automobile Safety (FITSA).
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of the drivers reported more than once for drunk driving then return to driving the car.
Alcohol would avoid it, because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the alcohol rate in the breathed air and prevents the car from being driven if the driver does not blow, or when a concentration of alcohol higher than the permitted one is detected.
The cost is more than EUR 1000 and would be borne by the sanctioned person.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 has shown that vehicles equipped with such devices can reduce up to 65% of the infringements committed during the first year of introduction.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people a year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to curb these behaviours before they become criminal offences.
And in order to facilitate its development, since the legal reform can be carried out on an ordinary basis, and, without a doubt, the reform necessary for the criminal procedure would require an organic law.
However, the device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial solution, although it has already been introduced experimentally in some industrial and public vehicles.
Just tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote for a PSOE initiative in which it intends to install this system on school buses, as has already been done in France.
In Mexico, and without "peep-toes"
With British punctuality, at 5.40 p.m., second programme, the Spanish plane in which they traveled the principles of Asturias landed in the presidential hangar at Benito Juárez Airport in Mexico City.
The sun was setting but the rays still forced to use the hand as a visor to see the royal couple get off the plane.
At the foot of the ladder, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities.
A few hours earlier I had asked a taxi driver on the road if he knew that the Spanish principles were about to visit the city to formalize an official trip.
- Ah, very well, so you can't go to the airport to charge people at the time... you're from here or...
No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a couple of years.
- Ah, very well...
The Mexican press, on the other hand, knows very well who are the principles of Asturias and the importance of the journey.
There are many waiting in the hangar of the airport crushed by the red carpet and the military cord composed of 27 marine soldiers who offer the greeting of honour.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in marine blue, and she, the princess, she calls the wind, very sober, does not use her usual "peep-toes," perhaps they told her that in Mexico City she threatened bad weather.
They give the photographers a smile and a brief stop before going into the room where the official committee awaits them.
At the door of the hotel where they live, one of the four largest in the city, a spirited Mexican television reporter awaits them.
The best award offered by fashion
There is probably no place in the world most appropriate to present a fashion prize, which is not Paris and probably there is no more exquisite designer and bont vivre of Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of El Button-Mango Fashion Awards, to promote international promotion of new talent in the field of fashion.
It offers a prize of €300,000.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at his drawings in the window of Mango at number 54 of Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost cried from emotion.
Moreover, it is the second largest company store in Europe and has just been opened with 1,335 square meters of extension.
The first is in London.
The many events, combined with the desire to please the designer Valentino who presided over the competition jury, began with a luxury dinner at the Paris Opera Garnier.
With the proximity of Chagal's most exquisite TVs, the presidential gala table prepared by Mango was even more spectacular.
Born, with broken heart and making necessity virtue, due to the recent death of his brother, he wore a garment of the House and some complements of ELAH to take off the breath and arm of his son Luis - a boy almost two meters high - accompanied Valentino to the presidency of the dinner of homage.
Andik, owner and lord of Mango, has done the honors of the house and as knight who is finished, together with Baron Rotchil, without jacket, because both had given them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who managed the store in pants and shirts – designed by her hand – transformed for dinner, wearing a very sensual black long dress and excited during the night walk accompanied by Goya Toledo in the opera, when they showed us the room for ballet essays and she, recalling other times, grabbed a bar and outlined a "great fold".
Inés Sastre did not stop for the walk in the palace premises, but she had first shown us her son's photos on her mobile phone.
The next day we were pleased with Olivier Martinez's presence – another boy who moved on a motorcycle – and John Travolta, who had arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and had previously made sure that there were no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, here's life.
1001, antistress number
There are not 1,000 but 1,000 and a way to forget the chaotic and frantic daily life.
And as if that wasn't enough, they're all collected in a book that will bring relaxation to the bookstores on September 30.
Awakening is almost a punishment when it blinks every morning at 7 a.m., but it is even worse to imagine being involved in the frenetic rhythm dictated by modern life.
The office is called tension and the backless computer.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
However, there is no one and no two methods to combat the daily exhaustion and the strain to get out of the world of work.
No, this number amounts to nothing more and nothing less than 1001.
Beyond yoga positions, classic massage or "spa" treatments, Susannah Marriott gathers in the pages of her book, a "menu" of custom options for taste and time of each.
The anti-stress work is called "1001 ways to relax" and its calm will reach the libraries thanks to the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that it is not possible to gain calm in areas such as labour or personal relations, this "manual" denies such conviction.
In addition, it suggests alternative solutions, such as being in contact with nature, or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline does not already flow into your veins to regain the balance of your body and stress has become a problem, it is time to sit on the couch, turn off your mind and focus on reading.
Talking in sleep
Some children talk at night.
I refer not to those who wake up very agitated to tell us something that happened to them on the previous day, but to those children who speak by staying asleep.
The first time that happens, at best you get scared, but it doesn't really matter very much.
It is a benign alteration of sleep called sleep.
It occurs with a certain frequency, especially in children and adolescents.
Surely most of you have told me that you talked in your sleep.
This phenomenon may occur in a very sporadic way (once in life, for example associated with a high fever episode) or with greater regularity (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the day after the child no longer remembers anything.
There is no single reason why this phenomenon can be explained.
Sometimes there are episodes related to other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night fears, night enuresis (make it pee in bed), or sleepwalking, but it is not necessarily so.
As already mentioned above can be associated with very high stages of fever, stress or distress.
In any case, it is a phenomenon that has not yet been studied.
Also the intensity with which it appears is extremely variable.
It may happen that the person speaks with a very quiet tone of voice, with loose words, almost in a whisper or that happens the opposite (scream, scream, long speeches ...).
In cases where the event is particularly intense, you should observe the child and possibly consult a specialist to see if there are any issues that are generating an abnormal state of anxiety as an outlet for the situation.
We said that it is a benign alteration therefore there is no treatment unless it is associated with other sleep disorders that can be treated (e.g. if coupled with insomnia or stress).
What can be done, however, is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child excessively before he goes to sleep.
Propose peaceful games and avoid television programs or series that arouse fear or suggest violence.
With very nervous children for whom it is tiring to relax, you can use relaxation techniques to help them gain a certain inner calm.
This will allow the child to sleep more quietly.
Once sleepwalkers show up trying to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will not remember anything of what happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake him up.
It's useless, because he's not aware of what's happening, and you'll interrupt his sleep.
Although he's talking, he's sleeping and so he's resting.
Remember that if you are very distressed and the episodes have a certain frequency it is better to consult a doctor or check where there is such a great anxiety in your child.
If you understand what it says (which is not the most common situation), do not fall into the temptation to interrogate him for information.
You won't get anything, because he's asleep and therefore unconscious to organize his thinking.
In addition, you are able to hear what it says but not to see what it is dreaming of saying it, so you need to pay close attention to the interpretation of the information and the conclusions to which it might lead.
Never tell the child that you could ask him questions during the night to learn about his secrets.
Not even for a joke.
Something like that causes enormous anguish.
In short, don't worry, it's nothing serious, it's an episode that only lasts a few minutes.
Illaeusern... finally
The Illhaeuseern finally found the road to victory in the house after a long unsuccessful period.
Without playing a great game, the Yellow-Blacks have created the largest number of network opportunities transforming one into the victory of the game.
The rhythm was not very sustained during this meeting where the attackers were struggling.
After a first attempt by the captain of the Kauffmann host team who ran over the seven with a shot from far away, the Illhaeusern began to have the best and one after the other provoked the defence of Dannemarie, Fonderflick from far away, then Hirn tall, Romain tip and still Diebold.
The Dannemarie responded with a block at the center of the camp, leaving only the triggered Riai at the attack tip.
The beginning of the second time was decisive with two initial occasions signed Riahi and Temporal for the Dannemarie, and immediately after the first network of Marais for the well-placed Illhaeusern, he took a ball rejected on a first attempt of Diebold (53').
But the gunner of the Illhaeuseern will not be able to taste his happiness for a long time and will be expelled a dozen minutes later leaving his teammates in numerical inferiority.
But the Dannemarie will not be able to take advantage of it and will not bring great problems to the Eleven of the Illhaeuserern, which was just "strengthened" the defense, except in the last few minutes of the game when, after a rockmbole action, the ball crossed the cross.
Sarkozy meets fishermen in anger
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will stop in Brittany.
The President of the Republic decided to go to the port of Guilvinec, in the department of Finistère, on Tuesday morning to enchant its representatives.
The latter promised to welcome him "with a constructive spirit" and hoped that "he would present himself with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit that takes place at the same time with the general assembly of the "crisis committee", created by the Breton fishermen in order to take measures to cope with the impension of the price of diesel oil, which has reached its record with an average of more than 1.14 euros per litre.
According to Eliseo David Martinon's spokesman, the president "will discuss with them the possible solutions to help businesses regain competitiveness and to ensure the working conditions and pay of the sailors".
Fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy to stand still.
Tuesday morning, they conducted "smooth operations" in Morbihan and Calvados, causing almost 10 km of congestion.
The port of Quiberon has also been blocked, but the connections with Belle-Île have not been interrupted.
On the peninsula of Quiberon a road block has been implemented.
On Monday the sailors have already proved their determination by burning, starting at dawn, tyres and pallets in front of the fuel deposits at the ports of Brest and Lorient, while taking foot demonstrations in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement extended towards the ports of the Atlantic coast and the Manica, such as Sables d'Olonne, in the Vendée, where the vessels remained at the dock, or to Havre, where about twenty boats prevented the movement of commercial ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe et del Croisic, near the Loire Atlantica, interrupted in the evening the blockade of the total refinery of Donges.
In Boulogne-sur-Mer they decided to wait for the meeting to be held on Wednesday in the ministry to decide any actions.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" will decide on Tuesday the future actions of the movement and the possible participation in the meeting scheduled for the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by those responsible for the National Fisheries Committee, who did not support the movement.
"The strike will continue" because "fishers will not give up" and "they do not intend to move to Paris", announced, for example, Liliane Cariou, Chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on gas oil, currently pay about 50 cents per litre, but estimate that the yield limit of a vessel is reached only with a gas oil less than 0.30 euros per litre.
Paul Newman the magnificent
The unforgettable performer of "Butch Cassidy" died of cancer, at the age of 83, in his house in Connecticut.
Hillary et Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and still Sam Mendes welcomed the legend of cinema and actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains delivery forecasts in 2008
The aircraft manufacturer has 215 deliveries this year, despite threats of recession on the world economy.
Embraer, the fourth global company in the sector, maintains the forecast of delivery for 2008 with the delivery of 215 aircraft, confirmed his president Fredrico Fleury Curado.
During the first half, he delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian company trusts widely in the Chinese market, especially for aircraft in the range between 30 and 120 seats.
To date, Embraer delivered in eight years 41 aircraft to Chinese customers.
AIG would yield more than 15% of its activities
The American International Group insurance company, set up by the American monetary authorities, would yield more than 15% of its activities in order to repay the 85 billion dollar loan, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
The IGA is ready to consider the sale of most of its activities, in addition to the sale of life insurance branches to the international market and the United States, specifies the newspaper on the basis of more than authoritative sources.
The AIG Board of Directors met on Sunday evening to consider any transfers, according to the FT.
No confirmation was obtained at the IGA.
The activities that the AIG intends to give up include the International Lease Financial Corp. Air Leasing subsidiary, its share of 59% of Transatlantic Holdings as well as its real estate portfolio and its investments in private equity, adds the FT.
No final decision has been taken in respect of these transfers, the FT continues.
The IGA must quickly recover liquidity in order to repay the loan of 85 billion concessionaires from the Federal Reserve, at the cost of seeing the American authorities impose 80% of its capital.
Paris: History Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange accused a historical collapse on Monday, after the House of Representatives spoke against Paulson's plan for the rescue of financial institutions: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a decrease never seen, approaching 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Media (DJIA) ended at 10,365,45, below 777.68 points.
In terms of points, the worst loss in its history (684.81 points) higher than that of 17 September 2001, the day of the reopening of the Stock Exchanges following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq, the index of the main technological titles, lost 199.61 points closing at 1.983.73 and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 8.81% (or 106.85 points) closing at 1.106.55, according to the final closing figures.
Demoralized at the beginning of the sitting, Wall Street is sunk after the unexpected refusal of the bank rescue plan, designed to bring stability to the markets.
By 228 votes against the plan and 205 in favour, the representatives rejected the funding requested by Treasury Minister Henry Paulson.
About two republicans out of three refused the plan.
"It is a negative signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"All this indicates how much the market counts on the project," he added, fearing that in a few days it could already be "too late" to adopt one.
"If the project were indeed dying (...) then the witness would quickly pass to the Fed – Federal Reserve- (the US central bank, ndr) and other central banks to solve the crisis, which would further limit the credit conditions," said Brian Bethune, financial and economic sector manager at Global Insight.
And highlighting the state of emergency, "every day that passes leads to the collapse of a financial institution" in the United States, stressed Piegza.
After the failure of the Washington Mutual on Friday, the authorities organized the purchase of Wachovia's banking activities by the rival Citygroup.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated sharply, urging urgent intervention in favour of the banks of the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, indicating that the markets "are not only in the face of an American crisis, but in the face of a global crisis," said FTN Financial analyst.
The bond market has risen strongly.
The return of the Treasury bills with a 10-year maturity has declined to 3,632%, compared to 3,827% on Friday evening, while the 30-year-old yield is 4,161%, compared to 4,357% on the previous day.
Obama in favour of the first television duel
After the first debate on Friday between the two candidates at the White House, here's a second to know who, between John McCain and Barack Obama, was the winner.
Without any surprise, the headquarters of the republican and democratic campaign proclaimed their respective victory of the television duel, followed by a third of the American families.
Politologist David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, while deserving, has not been brilliant enough to allow him to slow down in the five-week presidential polls.
The Gallup Institute, of which an opinion poll published on Saturday gives Obama a five-point advantage (49% versus 44% for McCain), shows that the democrat had the best.
An instant poll conducted by CbsNews on a sample of undecided voters, found that 39% of them consider Obama the winner, while 25% points to McCain.
A great performance by his Joe Biden listmate, expected during the first and only debate with rival Sarah Palin, should confirm on Thursday Obama's advantage.
"To underestimate it would be a mistake.
He has a good idea," however warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
The 70-year-old McCain has never ceased to promote his undisputed experience in foreign policy, highlighting the opponent's "ingenuity" with regard to the issues addressed during the first face-to-face.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that." he has often said many times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and skills needed to become president," he said.
What since yesterday constitutes a continuous target for the republican television campaign.
Obama, for his part, stressed that his election would represent a new future.
Without extending, it has been concise and precise.
It has promoted its readiness to make the right decisions and its intention to restore the image of the United States on the world stage.
"McCain never understood, unlike Obama," said this weekend, a democratic spot, blaming the Republican for not taking the necessary measures to deal with the impact of the financial crisis on the American people.
During the ninety minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you yesterday, Obama denounced, in front of 20,000 people gathered in North Carolina, under heavy rain, for an election meeting.
He has not even spoken the words "media class" or "workers".The financial crisis goes in favour of Obama, considered by the Americans as the most suitable person to save the economy on the edge of the precipice.
"Next week could be a decisive turn," considered yesterday the influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's economic outlook with that demonstrated by Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the democratic candidate, the current collapse "is the final verdict after eight years of bad economic policy adopted by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain".
Reiterating the intention to reduce taxes for 95% of Americans despite the Wall Street strikes, the senator of Illinois also mentioned among his priorities the achievement of possible energy independence of the country through the promotion of renewable energy and the implementation of a health insurance system.
McCain, for his part, would build a park of 45 nuclear centres by 2030.
The two candidates cautiously avoided the financial rescue questions of $700 billion (EUR 470 billion) adopted last night at Congress and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "did you notice that there were elections?"
Young people and opponents manifested on Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to challenge in advance the results of the legislation.
A few hundred Belarusians met on Sunday evening immediately after the closure of the electoral seats in the central square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislation.
While the results were still expected, many young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexandre Loukachenko: "the dictator, resignation".
Some confess that they haven't even voted: "Why? They'll do as much as they want, from my vote," says one boy.
They do not believe that this regime which has made it a good example before foreign observers in order to resume dialogue with the European Union is ready to take a democratic turn.
Sanctions, including the visa ban for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of goods, could be removed if these elections were considered legitimate by observers.
They didn't, according to the opposition.
"We have been led away by the electoral commissions and our observers have not been able to participate in the vote," complained Jouri Potemkine, spokesperson for the Union of Democratic Forces, an heterogeneous alliance of twelve parties.
"It is a change of facade," says Alexandre Milinkievitch, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential elections and head of the pro-European movement, because the important thing is who counts the cards and in this case is the executive.
If members of the opposition come into Parliament, it is because they have been appointed, and not elected.
But their entry into parliament may involve a television space, regional meetings and bills."
The opposition therefore has a duty to enter into political play because " dialogue with the European Union needs to be initiated.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, is in crisis, and we do not reform any, we risk becoming a Russian protectorate.
Now we want to be independent."
The opposition fears that the 'organisation for security and cooperation in Europe that has followed the electoral process recognises the validity of the poll.
He stressed that participation shares seemed too high, and that the generalisation of the vote in advance (26% of the voters in Minsk) gave way to all kinds of manipulation.
"Did you notice that there were elections? Ask social-democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released this year, in August.
There was no one at the polls.
And there will have been a maximum of five Members of the opposition to parliament, the most convenient to power."
Night silence falls on the square of October.
On television, President Loukachenko and the members of the Central Electoral Committee are pleased with their success.
The meeting - The blood is safe again
Héma-Québec celebrated yesterday the tenth anniversary of its foundation, and its president, Dr. FrancineDecary, had every reason to rejoice, since Hema-Québec became one of the safest and most effective blood suppliers in the world.
And above all, it has regained public confidence, seriously shaken by the scandal of infected blood in the years between 1980 and 1990.
As we know, the national blood reserves managed by the Transfusion Service of the Canadian Red Cross were infected with acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C in the 1980s.
Faced with such a drama and population protests, the Government of Canada conducted in February 1994 a public inquiry, led by Judge Horace Krever, which aimed to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to disseminate recommendations to prevent the recurrence of a similar disaster.
While Judge Krever was delaying writing a report, some provinces set up a committee with the aim of designing a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, this mandate was carried out by the Gélineau Committee.
Following the Gélineau et Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Héma-Québec to provide Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society (Canadian Blood Society) for all other provinces and two territories.
In 1998, when Héma-Québec started its activities, only 38% of people said they still believed in the donation system in Quebec, Dr. Décary recalled.
The situation was mortifying.
Thanks to continued efforts to improve the safety of blood samples and field research over the next few years, we gained public confidence," explains before saying proud that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of Quebec's population had already trusted in Hema-Québec.
Dr. Décary, however, is convinced that "trust is something extremely fragile."
Since its inception on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At the time, there were numerous cases in Europe of the human variant of the mad cow, a new manifestation of Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease, telling her that she has been in the presidency since 1998, the year of the foundation.
"And we didn't know whether that disease could be transmitted through infected blood.
There is therefore one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélinau reports, that when you have doubts and could achieve a serious disease, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease that manifests itself with a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, measures of exclusion are taken.
In April 1999, the blood of those who had spent more than a month in the United Kingdom since 1980 was refused.
Now, for a few years, it has been demonstrated that this disease is clearly transmitted by infected blood.
This episode has shown us that it made sense to apply the precautionary principle."
In 1999 a much more efficient technique appeared on the market for the identification of HIV: the tests of nucleic acid (TAN) that allow the presence of the virus in donor blood to be recognized directly in the blood of donors and not that of antibodies against it, on which the tests used until then were based.
The TANs have allowed to reduce the window period, or since the person contracted the disease to what the first viruses can be identified in the blood thanks to our techniques, explains the specialist.
That period could be reduced to less than one week.
The risk of ignoring the presence of infected donors and not being able to identify them is thus greatly reduced.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS with a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of receiving blood infected with the HIV virus.
"In other words, this means that it will be necessary to distribute 12 million blood samples before someone is infected with the HIV virus.
As Héma-Québec distributes between 400 000 and 500,000 blood samples annually, it will take more than 24 years before an HIV case is found with a transfusion.
I believe that today you can feel calm in receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to recover health, says the head of the Hema-Québec leadership.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
It is never known which pathogen will emerge in the system.
Not later than a year ago the Chikungunya virus, like the West Nile virus, appeared on the Island of Réunion, was transmitted in the blood by an insect.
We must be constantly vigilant," Dr. Décary continued before stressing that besides having safe resources, Hema-Québec must also provide sufficient supplies.
"Necessities increase as the population ages.
Being the most aggressive cancer cures, patients often need a intake of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing population also has consequences on the number of donors who on average constitute only 3% of Quebec's population acceptable as donors."
All healthy people who have reached 18 years of age and who meet the eligibility criteria may, however, donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14% of those offering themselves as donors are not accepted, because they are affected by AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have traveled to a country where the latter is disseminated, they will be refused for a period of one year.
"With this 3% we can maintain an inventory capable of responding to the needs of hospitals.
The cases of shortages are very rare.
But it is necessary to renew the members of this group of donors as they age and can no longer make donations.
Now it is difficult to convince people to donate blood, but above all to keep them and encourage them to become regular donors.
Nowadays life is so frenetic that it is hardly an hour to donate blood," says Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec not only distributes blood samples, but also human tissues, of which bone transplants, heart valves eye globes and skin that is used almost exclusively for severe burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before they are deposited at the Héma-Québec which manages the only public bank of umbilical cord blood in Quebec.
In the umbilical cord, which was once considered a biomedical waste, abundant blood rich in stem cells that can serve to cure serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"We celebrated, a few weeks ago, the insertion into the bank of our thousandth sample of cord blood and we plan to take more than a thousand each year.
You should start proposing them for transplants at the beginning of next year," says Dr. Décary, who describes this practice of taking cord blood as very popular.
"Many mothers are disappointed that they can't access you," because Héma-Québec does not have the necessary means to propose this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Calcium - The Impact in semifinal
The Impact Montreal qualified for the semifinals of the A series, winning 3-1 against the Seattle Sounders yesterday, during a second decisive match of the quarter of the final, at the Saputo Stadium.
Centrocampista Antonio Ribeiro, marked the decisive goal at 90'.
After a first goalless time on both sides, David Texto and Rocco Placentino marked the subsequent networks for Montreal.
For the Sounders, Roger Levesque was ready to mark Matt Jordan.
We remember that at the first round of the round back on Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, on the outskirts of Seattle.
The Impact will face the Vancouver Whitecaps in semifinal.
On Saturday evening in Minnesota, Thundler completed a first 3-1 in the return game winning 4-3, but the Whitecaps will still participate in the semifinal.
The Impact will have to deal with the Whitecaps both Friday and Sunday, but further details will be confirmed during the day.
In brief - Kovalev's decisive network
The Canadian and its aces are ready to start the season again.
The trio formed by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn animated the offensive phase of the game winning 3-2 against the Panthers, Florida, last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the star of the first meeting, scored a goal, took two steps, and collected a passage for the victory, in the fourth of the games preparing the Habs.
Decisive for victory the only network signed Kovalev.
"I'm not ready yet, he warned Russian.
I need another game to feel at ease."
"He tried to beat up in the first period, noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the outcome of the game.
There was a good ovation."
North Point Charest
The Prime Minister does not exclude the start of the elections before the end of the year.
Concluding the General Council of the Liberal Party, Jean Charest went to Jean-Talon yesterday, in Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc, (left), tries to be elected during today's partial elections.
"Strengthening the borders of our last great northern border": this is Jean Charest's long-term ambition presented yesterday to Levis, through instruments with a strong visual impact, on the occasion of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec.
Behind him, during his speech, the projection of a sort of "image mill".
On three maxi screens, they were confused by the spectacular negatives of hydroelectric dams, mining crops, images of Quebec seen with "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Great means as in the middle of the election campaign.
During the press conference, the Prime Minister refused to exclude the start of the autumn elections, although he noted that he was very busy.
The "North Floor" is the fourth point of a "project" that the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes a first agreement with France on labour, a second agreement between Canada and Europe and other agreements with Ontario.
Often appointed in the most recent speeches by the Prime Minister, the opening of the North-Northern territory to the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister merely explained why the North would be "a jewel of immense potential", but did not express itself about timing or investment shares, as well as did not explain what the precise priorities will be in the implementation of future projects.
Most of all, it has limited itself to pointing out what it believes is a priority position: hydroelectricity, forests, but above all the mining sector, which has experienced several improvements following the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
According to Charest's list, the North contains " nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds".
That "great territory the double of France", is here, is Quebec.
Not only is it here, but it is inherent in us," he insisted, as if he wanted to urge a national founding myth.
The foundations of Quebec are rooted in its relationship with the North, he stressed: the gold fever in Abitibi, the national engineering, the Bay of James.
"It is up to us, it is our future," he added, after a theatrical pause to contemplate the immense map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes part of the Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, said the Prime Minister during the press conference.
"It is a traditional position maintained by all governments.
There is a border line on which no agreement has been reached for a long time and, when the opportunity arises, I will reaffirm that position in the name of the government," he said.
Moreover, "having regard to climate change, we must re-evaluate the North," he said speaking of the passage of the north-west, which will be open all year round due to the melting of the ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister estimates that occupying the territory is a duty.’
And the inhabitants of the place, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec would be very careful about this and that the project would meet their interests, especially those of young people.
Two former ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former MP of the Hungarian PQ), have already initiated the consultation of some thirty communities.
An inter-ministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) holds an important position has begun work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a great meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a time when "common visions will be provided"
The development of the North would be linked to the principles of sustainable development.
The North Floor will be" concerted, ordered and respected the environment", he promised.
Jean Charest described this "project" as a continuum with that of the liberal prime ministers who preceded it.
"As the liberals who have preceded us, we know how to distinguish ourselves to turn the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was also one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a great cocktail in honour of the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival at the head of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to re-establish the Beauharnois Centrale in Diga Adélard-Godbout.
"From Godbout, creator of Hydro-Québec, to Lesage who nationalized hydroelectricity, to Bourassa, creator of Baia James, our party has always been able to forge the future," said Jean Charest.
During the press conference, another reference was made, this time conservative, to John Diefenbaker's "Street to the North", Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
Addressing the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, Charest stated that its implementation would be scheduled for 2012.
"All this remains between us, but I feel we will do it," he confessed to his militants, raising his applause.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April there would be no elections in 2008 and probably not even in 2009, did not waste the opportunity to start a poll in the autumn, which could happen in accordance with the law.
He stressed that he was certainly very busy, particularly at a federal council mission in China and in the Quebec-New York Summit.
The weekend's General Council has provided the Liberal Head with a platform for nationalist resolutions, in particular the "constitutional aspirations" that have passed reads like oil: the PLQ calls above all for the recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
It also hopes that Quebec will appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and that they will have a right to veto decisions taken in Quebec.
As far as the opposition is concerned, the northern plane was sceptically welcomed.
The PQ leader, Pauline Marois, has been renovating Quebec's Northern Development Policy launched by the Landry government in 2001.
According to you, the liberal government, which came to power in 2003, would not have respected its application.
If he had, "we would have made progress today," commented Marois next to Jean-Talon's candidate (voting today), Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ stated that it supported the Government's adoption of the Northern Plan.
"What we wish for, is that all this is not simply perceived as a show," commented Sébastien Proulx, a substitute for Mario Dumont, in return today for the holidays.
Letter - A dishonored country
He was Vic Toews, former minister of the "Justice" (array of fate) of Harper's cabinet, to allow himself to declare, last summer, that Louise Arbor was a " shame" for Canada.
To dishonor in this way a woman who has fought relentlessly for justice and who deserves all our admiration says much about the entourage of the Prime Minister, and about Stephen Harper himself.
Here we are before a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, to not have returned a citizen detained in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was simply a teenager at the time of the facts that had taken place.
The only government that, despite signing the Geneva Convention, denies its word and lets a child soldier rot in inhumane conditions.
The only one who trusts in a parody of justice to establish the guilt of the accused.
We recall, for information, that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Order of Canadian Lawyers, in particular, invoke Omar Khadraffin's return to Canada to be subject to a regular trial.
It is proper that same government that closes its eyes before torture: it doesn't matter to him that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, perhaps forever, after so many years of abuse.
We do not realize this yet, but we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, freedom and "democracy", a word that Harper does not stop showing off and that sounds so foolish about his lips.
Here we have come at a time when there is no morals anymore: you can mistreat, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen according to the discretion of a head of government until today minority (see what will happen after October 14...).
Many voters believe that a party that preaches the Virtue, the Respect for the Law and the Order represent salvation: they do not see that this government has renounced what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
This is the shame here, Mr Toews, in giving up all this, and nowhere else.
Free opinion - The Orwellian speech by Barrick Gold
In the September 17, Le Devoir published a letter by Mr. Patrick J. Garver, vice president of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Pursuing an orwellian logic, the latter claims that the world's largest auriferous company has carried a six million-protest dispute against three authors and a small square publishing house with the intention of starting a "transparent public debate".
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of a defamation dispute, but the law.
Without any surprise, this substantial difference is completely hidden by Garver.
Because for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to bring ruin to anyone who dares to support a position contrary to his.
Little does the outcome of the process, writers and editors of the book Canada Nero have to spend a substantial amount of money in order to organize their own defence and fight, with well-learned weapons, against an army of lawyers funded by practically bottomless pockets of the mining company.
Furthermore, in these arms struggles learned, the tactic is often that of ruining the defendant in order to impose a consensual regulation which employed the opposition in addition to scaring any injured person on the matter again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it's in front of the public that he should have presented his own view of the facts.
Contrary to what happens in many countries where Barrick Gold works, discussions usually take place in Canada with the exchange of views rather than with manganese strikes.
It would therefore be sufficient for the company to open its books, documents, and establish a real debate, through newspapers, media, publications and funding of independent research teams that could have shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to have too much confidence in public opinion and misappropriates petitions and letters in support of the authors of Canada Nero.
Maybe Garver could explain how he can ask for a "public" debate when his contempt for that same audience is obvious?
In the vice-president's world, it seems that this word only indicates the lawyers who are personally paid and not all Canadians; here is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In a democratic system, even denigrators have the right to speak.
What Barrack Gold does not understand – or does not want to understand – is that the public who supports the authors and publishers of Canada Nero does so primarily because he refuses the brutal means adopted by the mining company.
This audience is ready to listen to Barrick and to judge, but on the basis of civil exchanges of opinion, and not in view of what many perceive as a kind of watering (researching the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just given the authors of Canada Black an ultimatum inciting them to suspend the use of that word...)
Beyond Garver's surreal speech, the dispute held by Barack Gold is a direct attack on university freedom of research and the pursuit of truth, indispensable in every democratic society.
It denies the right to quote authentic sources and to debate facts and interpretations, which represent the very basis of intellectual work.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to study and discuss uncomfortable topics for the richest companies in the world, without multiple demands, who will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, he could do so by following the scientific standards as the authors of Canada Nero do.
You have the right to reply.
For a long time, the university environment, of which we belong, has been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
The excessive measures by Barrick Gold clearly show that, contrary to his claims, he is not looking for a transparent debate at all.
This is at the expense of the university world, as is the case with the same public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to take measures to limit abusive complaints.
Operation - Rescue for Wall Street – Dialogue between Republicans and Democrats
The Bush administration and Congress chiefs, representatives of the republican and democratic settlement, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the largest saving-financial plan after the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the US$700 billion plan, which aims to put a stop to the financial crisis that has been on Wall Street for months, has yet to be ratified by the two chambers of Congress.
In particular, it provides: verifications of its actual implementation by the elected leaders, new mechanisms guaranteeing the reimbursement of public money, new provisions to contain the number of homes that have not been paid, as well as an inspection right on the remuneration paid to the managers of the protected companies.
American Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelossi and Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday, at the end of a two-day negotiating marathon.
"We have made great progress towards an effective market agreement," said the representative of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson.
"Every decision has been taken in such a way as to safeguard the economy and the American people from the current crisis on Wall Street," the Democratic explained.
"It's the crucial point: if we hadn't acted in this way, invaluable discomforts and turmoil would have reversed over the daily lives of the Americans," said Republican Judd Gregg.
The conclusion of the negotiations was marked by concerns about the impact of a further failure on investors.
The time limit granted corresponded to the opening up of the markets this morning.
The two candidates for American presidential elections later joined the negotiations and were rather favourable to the agreement, but they did not express their discontent before the adoption of extreme solutions.
The Democratic Senator Barack Obama has the merit of adding some provisions to the agreement, in particular that will allow the owners to maintain their domicile and that relating to wages for state-owned business managers.
"When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of others, there is nothing to rejoice over.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on the American TV screen.
Interviewed on another channel to see if he will vote in favour of the plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied: "I would like to analyze the details, but I hope so."
"As far as I've read, it's something that we all have to digest and that will allow us to move on"
The option of a non-intervention is simply unacceptable," he said.
The 700 billion plan aims to re-acquire with taxpayers' money the doubts, risk and unsaleable assets of American financial institutions.
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis due to the outbreak of a real estate bubble that first led to the collapse of mortgage credit at risk (mutui) , then extend to other more widespread forms of credit securities (PCAA) and lead to the freezing of liquidity and the disbandment of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republicans in charge to blow up the first draft of an agreement last week.
It seems to have been out of that blind alley since the Democrats accepted that the "toxic" assets of some companies in difficulty are only protected by the government, rather than purchased.
In order to meet everyone at the Congress, a provision was added whereby, if the government were to face losses during the five years to come because of this programme, it could impose new taxes in order to maintain its balance.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion to which an additional 100 billion may be added if the President deems it necessary.
The payment of 350 billion should be ratified by a further vote of the Congress.
In exchange for its aid, Washington will obtain shares of participation in protected companies that will use dividends in case of profit and will be able to resell when the waters are calmed.
According to the plan, the federal government will have the opportunity to delay the procedures for the purification of real estate loans and to set limits on remuneration and departure allowances paid to the managers of the undertakings concerned.
From now on, the architects of the plan would like to submit it to the vote of the House of Representatives, and to the vote of the Senate Wednesday.
Despite all efforts, it is not yet certain that the free way is given to their plan.
In fact, yesterday there were several votes against the project, both at the republican and democratic settlements.
"Of course, Washington does not hear you," said Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House's Finance Committee.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But certainly not taking advantage of taxpayers..
Leader of a small group at Congress known as "the caucus of skeptics", democratic representative Brad Sherman presents the situation differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred eminent economic teachers, including three Nobel Prizes, wrote to us to say: we ask Congress not to draw prompt conclusions and carefully examine the way to be taken," he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, there was once again a test of the global nature of the crisis.
After an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion dollars).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary when the French bank BNS Paribas reported that it would give up buying its competitor, in full failure after the loss of EUR 2 billion (US$ 2.9 billion) for the crisis of risk real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis has 85 000 employees and is part of Europe's twenty largest banks and ten largest insurers.
"It's not lost money, said the Dutch Minister of Finance yesterday, Wouter Boss.
In return, the influence and the right to vote in banking matters are accepted.
It is certainly something that savers and families now appreciate that the times are announcing uncertainties"
During this period, at the other end of the Manica, the British government seems to be in the process of nationalizing another bank in the bank for the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all the loans currently under way at Bradford and Bringley Bank, of which more than 41 billion (755 billion dollars) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it will be you to purchase the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
Since the beginning of the economic crisis, Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank, after the Northern Rock, to undergo a process of nationalization by the English government.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a committed icon
The beauty with blue eyes was for a long time his ace in his sleeve, for others his weak point.
Did he get rid of the narcissistic mirror, the American actor from the smile ailing?
Yes and no.
His discretion, sensitivity and evident talent would have driven him out of that circle of powerful consecrated to true sacred monsters.
What a constancy!
Paul Newman, who disappeared on Friday, at the age of 83, in his Connecticut ranch, after lung cancer, remains one of the last icons of American cinema in the early years.
Less monumental by Brando, whom he resembled and long was a sort of rival on the screen, more prudent in his game, certainly more fragile, but also he spoke of freedom and the development of dramatic beliefs.
Mixed couples often give birth to magical children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 by a German Jewish father and mother of Hungarian origin.
From these European roots one of the glorious visions of the American dream will be born.
A humble ego, last quality brand.
Because in him there was a whole country under investigation of the safe made man, the fighter of the war of the Pacific, proud in the fight, who in the early 1950s studied dramatic art in Yale, subsequently attended the Actor Studio in New York, before triumphing to theatre, television and early cinema.
The same man who was a civil rights activist was also the driver who classified himself according to the 24 hours of Mans in 1979, as well as sex symbol, although part of a model couple since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
They go with him the shade zones of a reserved star, discreet, committed, allergic to the scandals of the show-business, of which you will never be able to fully reveal its mystery.
An honest man, in the noblest sense of the term.
This weekend Paul Newman's disappearance was a dive to the heart for the cinemafiers, while his great characters pop the black screen of memories.
Over half a century of American cinema in full transformation is proposed through its interpretations.
The charming cow-boy of Butch Cassidy (1969) and that boy are unable to desire the hot wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The cat on the roof that opens adapted by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
More recently, we remember it in the cloths of the sensitive Mr. Bridge (1990), disturbed by a marriage that did not keep what was promised.
A lot of other Paul Newman's gone to history.
The boxer Rocky Graziano, criminal, tormented, violent, unforgettable up there someone loves me, by Robert Wise, a role destined for James Dean and resumed after his death, which officially launched Newman in 1956.
That nice villain in the excellent Stangata, Oscar as the best movie in 1973.
A bitter and vengeful billiard player in the Spaccone, magnificent film by Robert Rossen (1961), The color of Martin Scorsese's money, which earned him in 1987 the only Oscar on 9 appointments.
That face over the years, it was his.
Still him.
Epochs happen through his path.
Young people know him especially for the cult movie Slap Shot- Dry shot by George Roy Hill (1977), in the role of Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in Mr. Hula Hoop, Coen's brothers.
The circle had closed with a last role as godfather of the Irish Mafia in my father's Era, in 2003.
Unlike the most famous film legends that soon abandoned the trade, Newman will remain in the halls, denouncing Hollywood throughout its costume, parties and concessions.
Bertrand Tavernier, a French filmmaker, defined him, with a tip of irony, as "a living challenge to underplay", judging his performance exaggerated.
The profession was not always a game for the beautiful Paul Newman, whose roles seemed to fall like manna from heaven.
However, he often preferred the role of the marginalized to that of the young actor: neurotic characters, drunk or desperate, of which he expressed banishment and rebellion with his perfect traits.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown nuances of his true, possible sensitivity.
Jennifer's first time in 1968 (based on the Canadian novel Margaret Laurence), with Joanne Woodward's wife in the role of the protagonist, drew a subtle female portrait of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott for an overdose, dedicated to him in 1984 the film Harry and Son, a discreet and sad film.
Among the countless raining tributes yesterday on Newman, his great friend and old comrade of arms Robert Redford (they had played together in La Stangata and Butch Cassidy) affirmed with infinite sadness "His presence has made my life and this country better."
Generosity and love for life, two great features of the missing actor.
Beyond a legendary career, a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a Hollywood-derived contestant is thus turned off.
We will have extravised his face to stand out on bottles of vinegar, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging him as a choice of bad taste, although born as a gag.
However, the revenues of those sales were destined for its Children's Foundation in difficulty.
Newman, instead of resting on his myth, chose to commit to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter saying "Always and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful to his good star.
Being there, it was a privilege."
And as much privilege was for us to follow the path of such a clean and generous American artist.
Citizens model, therefore, and much more.
What was produced in the Zushlag & members invoice factory?
Soon, on 8 October, the hearing of the criminal proceedings against János Zuchlag and members will be discussed.
The political man and his associates are accused of repeated commercial fraud committed in an association to criminalize which has caused considerable damage, and of other crimes, including forgery of documents.
According to the Procura the money obtained from competition notices was used by them for private purposes, and they have often certified the conduct of the activities by means of false invoices.
The state and municipal money, in total 65 million florins, was partly finished in the cases of the Fiatal Baloldal organization, in part in the pockets of some people.
According to the method, made known by the investigating authorities, they took the money obtained from invitations to tender on the basis of invoices for non-existing transactions and the associations never fulfilled their obligations.
According to the indictment most of the invoices were false.
To make them, the bill blocks were purchased at the Józsefváros market, the circular stamps instead were manufactured in Kiskunhalas.
And to decide on behalf of which companies to issue invoices, it was established, among other things, during the trip between the hills above the Balaton where János Zuchlag had sent István Lados.
According to the confession of the latter he had to choose pensions and restaurants.
He asked for an invoice for consumption, on the model of these, the invoices to be sent to the competition notices, among others, to those of the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and the City of Budapest.
Most of these are the work of István Lados and András, who, according to our information, have drawn up above all the reports necessary to obtain funding.
One of the choices of Lados' "travel studies" was a brewery.
According to two invoices issued by Zushlag and members in 2003, the restaurant provided meals for a group of 90 people from the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
So many people, however, according to the restorator, would not all enter the club together.
Similarly, the invoice issued in summer 2002 to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, later called Együtt in Harmadik Évezredért, is full of formal errors and content errors.
A Badacsonytomaj pension has only three rooms, more than 10 people could not stay overnight, however in the invoice were 130 guests.
But the compilers of invoices full of fantasy have exaggerated when they reported the Pigal Kft., also this one deals with catering, in whose accounts - according to the information issued to the judicial authorities - did not even include the documents on behalf of the companies Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá.
Győző Farkas, managing director of the company, told hvg.hu that when he was summoned to the prosecution and showed him the invoices, he soon realized that it was fake documents.
"On the stamp the name and game Iva of our company were in the wrong place."
He added: in addition to the formal reasons he did not return even the fact that according to the invoice there were a hundred people, when in total they have eleven rooms and there are not so many beds.
By the time the invoice was catering and their restaurant has been out of operation for some time.
The frequent invoice compilers did not care to inform themselves that the Budapest travel agency of their choice, organizes only travel abroad, so they have foolishly indicated on the invoice with payment in cash travel in Hungary, which did not agree with the company's practice of issuing invoices.
In addition, as demonstrated during the investigation, VAT was also included, while travel to countries outside the European Union was exempt from VAT.
Among other things, the amount of VAT was wrong on the four documents issued by Hotel Revfülöp Kft. in favour of the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, in fact, on the services offered by the company it must apply VAT to 15% and not to 25% as indicated on invoices, also the hotel employees only issue printed invoices, while the invoice manufactured was handwritten.
In addition to this, "issuers" ruined other invoices, in the case of a company they indicated as activities carried out by road freight, as is known from the Procura procedure, activities which were not carried out by the company originally founded by investment consultancy.
In addition for formal defects - non-compliant invoice format cause, false stamp - it has been discovered that invoices issued in favor of Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, of XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont are false.
The same happened in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehértó Sports Camp, whose representatives refused to issue the invoices in question.
The counterfeiters did not even pay attention to the fact that the HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was in liquidation when (2001) had lunch with a group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület, precisely for this reason the curator of the company's liquidation, according to our information, denied that he had issued that invoice.
Invoices have been issued knowingly
Another group of bill issuers consists of those who were aware of having to issue fictional invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation has issued an invoice at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták for the Együtt Foundation in Harmadik Évezredért of almost 4 million florins.
Ludovic Györfi, one of the defendants, according to the indictment, persuaded the director of Collab Kft. to issue fictional invoices.
He collaborated with Zuschlag and partners also the Biogate Kft currently in liquidation, which in 2003 provided invoices issued for about 5 million florins to the Jobb Jövőért Alapitvány Foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület Association and the association Vörösfenyő Egysület, behind which there was no real economic activity.
Not even money movement because the invoices prepared were then extorted, but associations forgot to include this aspect in their documents.
In the following group of invoice companies belong to those who are related to the defendants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov, authorized by the Director General of the Delta Trió Kft, based in Budapest but not available there, which deals with the commercialization of fuel and motor vehicles.
The company issued several invoices in October, November and December 2005 on the sale of computer media, worth approximately 18 million florins.
According to the facts of the investigation, the Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas under liquidation since 14 September 2005 purchased these invoices.
The director-general of this company was a Romanian to whom Ivan Kubatov would have forwarded documents concerning the company between 2002 and 2005.
As we know from Kubatov, during the investigation, he acknowledged that he had issued invoices on behalf of the company to Atlasz, Hoppá and Együtt companies in Harmadik Évezredért Alapitvány and the countervalue was taken from him.
At the express request of Ivan Kubatov Romanian Murators founded the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
However, none of the companies were operational, because according to the defendant they had not received a job.
However, the companies returned useful to them because, at the request of the co-legitimate lawyer Zsolt Szente, editor of the foundation documents of the companies, invoices were issued to associations related to Zushlag: Atlasz and Y-Generació.
On behalf of the Cash Investment companies, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade Kubatov has released 15 invoices to the various entities for a total value of 14.2 million florins.
The prosecutor considers that Kubatov has overburdened 10% of the amounts shown on the invoices and VAT.
The man also used the Szi-Beri Bt. to issue fictional invoices, manufactured for the competition notice of Biztos Pont.
Y-Genéració and Szövetség in Modern Magyarországért in January 2006 presented a ban for the public utility agency of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA).
They also won 500,000 guilders per head but the sums were not used for the purposes indicated in the ban.
So that this would not come to the branch, they presented to TMA five fictional invoices received from the Works Team Kft.
These invoices were found during the search of the office of Árpád Kemecsei at the Ministry of Public Education.
At the hearing some of the defendants, as they have already done in the prosecution, will probably report on the progress of the production of invoices.
However, the most interesting thing could be if the defendant number one, János Zuchlag, decided to lift the veil on everything.
His confession so far has not been very detailed and although he has promised many times to speak of everything in an extensive way, he has not yet done so.
We must see if it is in his interest, it might also be that the socialists have made agreements with Zusi, which - in exchange for a compensation of 50 million florins, much of the damage - would be willing to make the scapegoat.
Zuschlag could have also been offended at the fact that his requests for relief from his prison conditions, i.e. the granting of home arrests, have not yet been met.
While the perpetrators of non-responsible commercial crimes and causing much greater damage can freely walk or at least wait at home for the end of the proceedings against them, which to him is not granted.
The psychology of excessive bidding: why spend more money?
At auctions buyers are prone to spend more, to overestimate the goods.
Neurologists and economists researchers at the University of New York have been able to discover the neuro-economic bases of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to their study on Science magazine, men do not want to stay back in a race such as eBay auction, so they are available to pay even a higher price.
The research sought to trace the nervous pattern of this "lot" at the nervous system level through experimental auctions.
A group of volunteers played the lot, the other group of players participated in an auction while the functional magnetic resonance imaging method (FMRI) examined the active areas of the brain of the people participating in the experiment.
In both games participants could win money, but in the auction game, in which the substantial element is to bid more than the other, the body crawled under the cerebral cortex becomes intensively functional when you lose the game.
This brain area, in addition to other functions, plays a role in the "self-gratification" mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, according to researchers, the rise of the price is explained by scanning the vehement reaction of the striated body.
To support their theory, the economists of the research group carried out a financial investigation.
In this survey three groups tendered against a partner under different conditions.
The control group reported how much the actual value of the product in question was and they made their bet.
In addition to this, another group has promised that in the case of winning they will receive another $15 prize.
The third group would have received $15 before the auction, but the members of the group would have lost their money in case of a loss at the auction.
The difference between the two groups consisted of the fact that for one of them the winning was emphasized, while for the other the loss.
By checking the hypothesis of neurologists the members of the group playing "against loss" were willing to make higher bets of the control group or "winner".
"These results are not deductible from any of the previously existing economic theories.
These so far explained the phenomena found at auctions with the joy of winning and avoiding risk.
Only the methods of creating the neurological image have helped to resolve the contradiction between the two theories, so that we have come to a third explanation" - said Andrew Schotter, professor of the Faculty of Economics of the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When to contact your doctor?
Almost half a billion people in the world suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, but in Hungary, chronic liver diseases are mentioned among the first causes of death.
In Hungary the number of hepatitis patients amounts to one hundred thousand, of which only 7,000 are treated: the reason is that many patients do not know how to be infected.
The definition of hepatitis is the collective name of infectious liver diseases caused by several viruses.
There are many similarities between the symptoms, typical of hepatitis and jaundice, but their pathogens and the diseases caused differ from one another.
Hepatitis viruses spread in two main forms depending on the pathogenic agent: hepatitis A and E through the food channel (e.g., infected water and food), hepatitis B, C, D and other blood viruses and organic fluids (sperm, vaginal loss, saliva).
For those travelling it is useful to vaccinate against the A and B virus, against the C there is no vaccine.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after the consumption of infected foods, accompanied by general malaise, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After yellow spots are formed on the skin and on the white of the eyes, the faeces become clear and the urine dark, the healing takes place within two to three weeks.
One million people die every year worldwide for hepatitis B, the most serious variant of the disease, which causes liver cancer and cirrhosis.
The main reason is, according to estimates, that only one in ten people receive pharmacological treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if not treated it can cause liver cirrhosis and liver cancer.
Most infected people do not know that they have contracted the disease because pathogens subdominate liver cells, in many cases the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
Therefore, it is very important to prevent and carry out regular medical analyses.
This disease is much more frequent than the average in three groups: those who had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts and tattoos.
In the world today, the number of people infected with chronic hepatitis C virus amounts to 200 million.
Since a routine laboratory examination also reveals that the disease is worth contacting your family doctor when you notice any symptoms of unknown origin.
Recognized in time the disease is curable, the virus can be eliminated from the body, thus the infectious power ceases and the formation of tumours can be prevented.
September 30 is the world day of hepatitis, first organized in 2004 by sick people's associations worldwide.
The aim is to draw attention to chronic viral hepatitis, the causes of its development and the early recognition of the disease.
Who believes in God feels less pain?
According to the result of a recent survey, religious faith works as a sort of analgesic that has made the death of Catholic martyrdom more bearable.
Scientists at Oxford University have conducted an interesting experiment, examining how faith in God influences the feeling of pain, British Telegraph reported.
An electroshock was carried out in the context of the somewhat bizarre survey of 12 Catholic believers and the same atheists, while all of them observed a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
Based on the results, Catholic believers were able to reject much of the pain.
Thanks to the exploratory technique of the human brain it was discovered that Catholics were able to activate the part of the brain responsible for pain control.
The test is the first of a series of researches in which, in addition to academics, scientists, philosophers and theologians participate in the University.
The test was carried out exactly like this: an instrument that emits discharges and passes the electroshock was connected to the left hand of the subject of the experiment.
The researchers asked the participants to focus on two paintings, the Virgin Mary painted in the 17th century by Sassoferrato and the Lady with the Hermelino by Leonardo da Vinci painted in the 15th century.
The authors of the examination hoped that the image of the Virgin Mary originated a kind of religious state among believers, while Leonardo's picture was chosen because it did not differ too much and they thought it had a reassuring effect.
The subjects of the experiment spent half an hour in front of the MRI scanner and in this time zone they received 20 electroshocks in four consecutive series, while they observed either the painting on religious theme or the other.
The Catholics reported that the vision of the Virgin Mary made them feel "safe", as if "someone took care of them" and "they calmed down and were pervaded by peace".
Looking at the image on a religious theme, they realized 12% less pain than when they had Leonardo's work in front of them.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who took part in the test himself, believes that such a result can be achieved with any image from the strong effect also for atheists, however, you must find the right image.
"We have to look for an image to which they have very positive feelings, like a mother or father," said the psychologist.
The Anglican bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"The practice of faith should change, and in many cases can change our personality." - added Wright.
After the excellent results, only the question remains whether the painting of a Madonna of Leonardo or another painter of such a caliber is presented to the believers, what effect could it have on the control of pain?
Would the vision of a quality virgin Mary produce better results?
You're what you say about yourself.
On the day of the tenth birthday Google can claim to be in people's pockets as well as in the sky above their heads; it knows where they spent their holidays, which outpatient clinic they attend and what interests them.
However, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's directors, that's not enough.
What concerns skeptics who compare with the Orwellian nightmare, they do not really see the substance of the web 2.0.
Recently Eric Schmidt told the Financial Times that Google's main purpose is to collect as much personal data as its users and this is necessary to meet the original goal of Google's founders as it was: "we enter into a system all the information of the world!".
According to the Google director interviewed the company, after 10 years of revolutionary work, it is still beginning to be able to manage all the information.
To the question what will happen in five years Schmidt answered: he would like if Google could answer questions like "what do I do tomorrow?" or "what would be the right job for me?", but software doesn't know how to answer apparently simple questions because they don't know enough about users.
Not all Internet users are aware that exactly the words searched, from which IP address are searched, and on which page interested people are stopped after the search.
Through the Personalized Search launched two years ago users e.g. can store their browsing history, they can relate to what they have looked for and clicked, they will eventually generate much better results; on this same logic are based Recommendations with which the system offers us products and services based on our previously declared and registered preferences.
What happens if my data is used against me, if they look at what I'm dealing with? - concerned users of Google's data monopoly are asked.
In most cases the counter-reactions of the detainees are caused by the fear experienced by the size of the potential power represented by the company, and not by the sense of guilt, fear of punishment, desire for freedom or even rebellion to power.
However, one fact is confirmed and that all the expressions sought are not only recorded but in reasoned cases can also be provided to third parties, in such legal cases nothing defends the personal rights of detainees.
The most striking example of this in recent times was perhaps coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, in which Google forwarded to the Brazilian government information that made it possible to identify pedophiles from the Orkut community page maintained by Google.
The inmates concerned about personal rights instead sighed in May when the company - in agreement with the EFF legal protection association - successfully demonstrated the truth in court against the FBI: neither can Google be forced with any point of the constitution to provide any information required secretly by the FBI.
(At the same time the federal government successfully extracted nearly 50,000 web addresses and a thousand search expressions obtained with reference to the confirmation of the children's protection law passed years earlier, but nevertheless failed to obtain individual user search lists and the entire list of web pages and keywords dating back to two months.)
Google's judgment is therefore quite contradictory: those who fear to provide their personal data diverge from Google because they believe that this is the way their intimate sphere and private life are being affected by starting to use their services and stand up with the rebellion of the multinationals that stand out for the conservative image.
Meanwhile the American geek culture and the proliferation of fans, activists and computer users appearing in many countries see in them the future generation of big companies, the "cool corporation", unlike their rival, Microsoft liquidated as a conqueror of the world because of Windows, although they both fight for the same goal.
This can happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for an identification code, does not ask for money for its services, the source code kept always up-to-date and the program package is much more accessible, youth and cool of the official software colossus practice.
But it can also happen because geeks see exactly the problematic relationship between personal rights and the internet, which implies just one of the key words most often repeated in recent years, the web 2.0.
Web 2.0 speaks only of collaboration, to intentionally leave traces behind us and to exploit the communicative channels at our disposal and while the size of these changes for each individual, the substance is the same: to show ourselves.
A young average can create profiles in several community pages, from Facebook to Xanga, can connect them with other services such as Twitter or last.fm that lists its musical tastes, all of which can be included in systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, can also write blogs on which its most recent photo galleries automatically appear stored on Flickr or Picasa.
Meanwhile we read of numerous examples from which it is clear that the girl, seeing the series of photos taken in the morning by the common round of friends, easily comes to know with whom she spent the night her perfido boy or a firm can fire her employee because she has written a sincere opinion on the corporate summit: one thing is sure, the concept of private life now has been completely reconsidered.
Those who live an online life do so to show themselves and thus we can formulate the fundamental thesis that hides behind the behavior of young people.
Those who want to hide something or just want to avoid Google's monopoly can do so (starting with Scroogle for example using Google's search system but who at the same time does not voluntarily leave traces).
There are not a few people who do not register on community pages for not being found, Google's online applications, from text processing to image management and news collection, can be replaced with alternative versions not related to huge server parks and which do not make up our best existing profile so far.
Public opinion doesn't even wait in secret for the moment when Google will pull out the claws.
Currently the company with its 156 billion dollars worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising space threatens revenue from advertising agencies, services introduced in record time cause serious harm not only to Microsoft but also to many software development companies.
However, the critical observers next to all of this find some alarming points: the corporate summit, for example, has completely rejected the employee protest after doubling the business asylum line, considered the repeated daily catering to employees' pleasure to be too costly, but all this diminishes in view of the fact that in 2006 Google has failed the Chinese government and according to their agreement the company will filter all the results that offend the good taste and interests of the Chinese regime.
An internal rule of the company seems to be not to advertise a new service in advance but only when it will be usable, one thing is certain, that the foreseeable problems of the coming months and years will move the world at one point: while some believe that the Google Book and Magazine scanning and storage project will take on proportions such that the company will soon be in front of the U.S. Supreme Court, others are afraid of the health system, in fact we can create our health profile with our referenda, doctors and problems.
The fact that Google is building a given genetic base can offer good material to the next generation of science fiction writers, the Scroogled account of the famous Cory Doctorow describes the future with orwellian accents, in which a man with Google data can be approached in an alarming manner.
Two minors helped Ózd's double murder to make the tracks disappear
The police questioned two minors about the double murder of Ózd, suspected with substance of having helped to make the traces of the crime disappear - declared Tuesday the spokesperson of the Police Question of the Borsod region.
Young people have admitted the offence to their accusers, they are currently accused of favouring them.
The two minors, two girls according to MTI information, defend themselves on their own.
The benefit is punishable up to 5 years of imprisonment.
The suspect of the double murder of Ózd, a 23-year-old man from the site, was placed in pre-trial detention on Sunday.
He is suspected of premeditated murder committed for profit.
From the survey it turned out that the twenty-nine-year-old had a big debt with a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to pay the debt, so last Wednesday he lured his creditor into a Ózd yard where he and his nine-year-old daughter were killed.
According to MTI information the young man had prepared to commit the crime, a signal is that he committed the murder with a concealed weapon on the spot.
The police are examining the weapon and the circumstances of use with the involvement of an expert.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange made an offer for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has offered 200 million euros, about 5 billion Czech kroner, for the purchase of 100% of the stock listing of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolowski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Poles despite the Czechs had previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange as a possible buyer of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for the exclusion is the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is owned by the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state which intends to sell over a few months more than 60% of its securities.
The Czech financial daily E15 states that the offer of Poles represents the highest figure so far advanced for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press so far they have presented an offer the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the New York Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the German Stock Exchange.
Petr Koblic, director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among all concerned the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst owner and did not exclude that this could lead in the future to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange in 5-10 billion krona.
According to the shareholders' agreement, almost 90% of the securities would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Finance Country with a share of almost 25%, followed by Bank Česká Spořitelna with 14.7% and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5%
The economic crisis from the point of view of the European newspapers
The main European newspapers in their Tuesday comments devoted to the international economic crisis are already talking about "a second September".
The global financial disaster has taken place thanks to the American president, who accuses La Repubblica, who has not been able to compact his party behind a law that has been bogged down in a hurry, whose aim is to remedy a desperate situation.
Instead of a second Pearl Harbour, as the billionaire super financier Warren Buffett said, it would be more accurate to speak of a second September 11th.
Even a part of Madrid's press sees in Washington the scapegoat.
According to El Mundo, the lack of American political leadership has cast the world economy on the edge of the waste.
The danger of the collapse of the American financial system is growing, and this will be suffered by the whole world.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but as a result of the Congress vote, there is the danger that Washington will not offer a political means for managing the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air, just when the greatest transformation of the history of capitalism is taking place.
It is no longer possible to miss the threat - mention the Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva.
Some states today can still offer a bailout to bartering financial institutions and taxpayers' money can save them from bankruptcy.
But if more and more banks collapse as in a domino effect then they will no longer be sufficient financial means or new sudden solutions.
In the long term, it is necessary for Member States of the European Union to overcome their national selfishness and concentrate control on the dismembered financial markets.
Only Monday the weak financial institutions have obtained more than 100 billion euros - recalls the Viennese Der Standard, according to which anxiety seems increasingly real that even European taxpayers, like those in the United States, will have to put their wallet into their hands to remedy the crisis.
The EU has so far not been very concerned about the crisis that has crossed the old continent as a tsunami.
"Salvators" should not immediately disburse the EUR 100 billion, however it would be better if they determined in which case it is appropriate to touch taxpayers' money to prevent further damage.
The intelligent machine mimics the flight of the skull
What could be the best way to develop anticollition technologies if you do not imitate the sensors of the obstacles that are in nature?
For example, bees.
In the surprising project presented to CEATEC in Japan, the Calabrians gave the initial strategic direction to Nissan engineers on how to build the next generation of anti-collition systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo the Nissan has built the biomimetic robot BR23C, a robotized mini-auto with the properties of the bees, with the ultimate aim of creating a system able to scan all the collisions.
Flying the bees form their own oval personal space that really resembles our protective shield - explained to the exhibition Kazuhiro Doi, director of PR technology and research and development.
Important is the role of the view of the ape, capable of a view of 300 degrees in each direction.
Engineers drew on the telemetric laser idea to copy the function of the ape view.
The BR23C detects obstacles up to two meters away within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates its distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor that immediately transforms it into a command to avoid collision.
In a fraction of second the robot perceives the obstacle and then, imitating the movements of the bee, changes direction immediately turning the wheels of the measure necessary to avoid the accident.
This avoidance maneuver, unlike the current system, is carried out in a completely instinctive way.
"If it weren't so the robot car wouldn't react fast to avoid collisions," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robot auto project.
It must react instinctively and immediately because this technology corresponds to the harmful and more internal layer of the protective shield, within which collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what makes a bee to avoid other bees.
This process must take place in an eyebrow.
But unlike bees, the deviation cannot go up or down or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional and in the direction of steering the wheels.
Instead of the endless possibilities available to bees to scan other bees, the robot, as a possibility available, can rotate on itself, speed up and slow down.
The BR23C is powered by batteries to lithium polymers, lighter and high energy density, which means that their duration is greater than that of lithium ions.
According to Andoh it is important the instantity of the intelligent reaction, not the processing of data or even less the ability to store them.
This robot must process some inputs in a few seconds and react.
There is no need to store them and react with intuitive logic based on previous maneuver data, so it uses only a memory of a few tens of Kb.
There's no need for a memory of gigabyte or megabyte.
This is the first step towards the development of a technology for the immediate avoidance of collisions which, they predict to Nissan, can be installed on standard vehicles within 10 years.
Further possibilities of application can be represented by unification with the GPS satellite navigation system that avoiding obstacles on the road leads to destination.

The written version of the US$700 billion economic rescue law for the purchase of disproportionate credits has been drafted, to be applied in several parts.
In the first step, half of the sum is spent.
In the new agreements protracted until midnight on Saturday according to the time of the east coast the conference leaders decided the bailout plan of 700 billion dollars after a debate that lasted for days - Reuters reported.
We have made some serious steps forward - said Nancy Pelossi, democratic president of the House of American Representatives according to which he only remained to put the agreement on paper.
Both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain, supported the plan's compromise.
The Treasury Minister Henry Paulson speaking of the outcome of the compromise said: the programme will work and will be effective, but there is still much to be done. According to Pelosis, this is not about saving Wall Street but about investing the economic car.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of Asian markets at 8 p.m. in Washington (2 p.m. on Monday night according to Central Europe time), but did not bring a great growth in the scholarships.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will first vote on the draft defined Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 for the program, after which it will play for the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke on Saturday night with the Pelosis, then joyfully welcomed the White House with the news of the agreement.
We are pleased with the progress achieved last night and appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilize our financial markets and defend the economy - said Tony Fratto spokesperson of the White House.
However, the programme differs from the original proposal of the Bush administration, which predicted that the $700 billion would all be spent on the purchase of securities with disproportionate credits behind it.
Now as a first step you can spend up to half of the sum of 700 billion dollars, 250 billion immediately after the vote on Monday of the Congress, with these the Treasury Ministry will buy securities with disproportionate credits behind it, of the fate of the remaining 100 billion dollars will decide the president.
A special college will monitor the programme to which the President of the Federal Reserve also participates.
The expenditure of the other half of the 700 billion depends on a new Congress decree.
Under the law, the Ministry of the Treasury may apply a combined tactic: it may buy at the same time credits, mortgages and securities with mortgages and other types of "poisonous" credits.
The purchase can take place through auctions and directly - they have announced competent of the ministry.
The legal rule makes it possible for interested companies to take part in an insurance programme where the Treasury Ministry guarantees the means which cause concern, for which companies will pay an adequate price for the likely damage.
Henrz Paulson said: the law provides the means necessary for 700 billion dollars to arrive for the urgent needs of the American monetary system, whether it is the purchase of wrong financial means, their insurance or to avoid the risk of the collapse of a large financial institution.
We will take all necessary steps to get us ready to introduce the law just signed - he added.
The directors of the banks in crisis and awaiting state aid think instead that the government will limit their welfare, defined by the overseas slang simply as golden parachutes.
Limitations on payments will only take place in some cases, and the limitations depend on how the Treasury Ministry will provide aid.
In essence, the limitation means that if the ministry acquires under an auction, it will impose a surplus on the golden parachute, if it does not retire the director of the deceased bank.
At the time of the direct purchase of disproportionate credits the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the money of the directors is not exaggerated.
In addition, the existing Gold Parachute contracts will not change, the limitation is only valid for new ones to encourage participation in the programme.
This is the first case in the American history of the entry into force of a legal limitation concerning the remuneration of general administrators - commented on the measure the Democratic Barney Frank President of the Committee responsible for financial services of the House of Representatives.
In addition, the state has the right to appropriate a share of the banks participating in the programme, reducing the risk of taxpayers, since in the end they can also gain us if the economy, and together with the bank saved, will re-establish itself.
The proposed law includes that over the next five years the President must submit to Congress a proposal which provides how to return the expected losses from the financial sector to taxpayers.
Of course from both sides there were those who expressed their doubts about the project.
This is not what American citizens asked us not to defend taxpayers' dollars - said the Republican MP of California Darrell Issa.
His Democratic colleague, Ohio Mary Kaptur, felt that the measures had been taken by themselves who were responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

Next year in the United States without a visa?
Kinga Göncz sees the possibility that the US-Hungarian visa exemption agreement will enter into force on 12 January - the Foreign Minister has spoken about this in Chicago with the Hungarian representatives of the place.
According to his opinion "now everything depends on the fact that the electronic input and control system is built in time".
However, he drew attention to the fact that in the new system there will be no entry permit, but before departure tourists will have to be registered.
The Hungarian diplomat will continue negotiations in Washington today.
He will meet with the Foreign Minister Condoleeza Rice, to whom he will present the medal of the Order of the Hungarian Republic with the Star and hold talks with the Foreign Policy Consultants of Democratic candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and John McCain also supported the bank rescue plan
Barack Obama and John McCain, the candidates for the presidency of the two major American parties, guaranteed on Sunday their support for the $700 billion government plan for the rescue of banks, but there are politicians who claim the resignation of the Treasury Minister.
The representatives of Congress and Administration after the marathon negotiations lasted for days, Sunday night announced that they had concluded an agreement in principle on the bank rescue plan.
The Wall Street crisis and the financial package for the release of the frozen credit market have become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain want to be more suitable than their rivals to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls with the focus on economic issues Obama has again regained some advantage, while McCain's advantage, obtained after the Republican Convention with the appointment of Sarah Palin's vice president, has dispersed.
Obama in a speech in Detroit expressed the hope that the Congress would quickly pass the law on the $700 billion plan.
He stressed that the proposal contained those steps of consumer protection which were also supported by him.
"Now we must act responsibly (...), the danger threatens your work, your savings, all industrial sectors, complete economic stability" - he said in front of a crowd of 35,000 people.
He didn't let himself out of defining McCain's economic ideas.
McCain in an interview at the ABC explained that "all of us will send this situation down with difficulty (...) but not doing anything is not a road to go."
The Republican Senator reported that the proposal included the creation of a control committee of the Minister of Finance and the limitation of the good exits of the top managers, which he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no merit role in the agreements, but he was in daily contact with the minister.
President Nancy Pelossi on Sunday reported that the House of Representatives will probably vote on the bill on Monday.
German-speaking world press review
The pole of the right is intact, only within the pole the voters have become more self-aware - thus analyzes Der Spiegel the weak result of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider's party is ready to govern Austria to prevent the red-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
Franz Walter, in the Internet edition of the German left magazine, in the article The Revolution of Bavaria devours its parents analyzes the causes of the tragic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known polytologist, the erosion of the CSU started long before the sad Beckstein-Huber couple came into charge.
The Christians-social have modernised Bavaria for decades and right now these modern citizens are turning away from them.
The change of time is at the same time a problem of all Christian democracy, so also of Angela Merker.
The defeat was not a great surprise for the CSU, but Sunday ended a process that exactly ten years ago was feasible: the undisputed hegemony of a state-party is over.
10 years ago, in 1998, the CSU had dropped to 47.7%, for the first time below the 50% threshold since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago at the elections of the Bundestag in 2005 still in the period of the so-called Stoiber.
The reason for this is the subsequent modernization in the region, which devours parents.
Sociologists have predicted it 40 years ago, but they have made a mistake of a long time. But secularization, the results of education, the settlement of the Germans of the East and the North in the developed Bavarian region could not remain without consequences on the loyalty of the voters to the CSU.
Modernisation must be accompanied by increased possibilities and the political consequences are evident.
The pole of the right is intact, only within the pole the voters have become more self-conscious, critical, stubborn.
It is also surprising that in recent weeks the classic bourgeois groups, free professionals, artisans, diplomats and graduates, have moved away from the CSU.
Here support for the CSU has dropped below 40%.
Die Presse (depresse.com)
The conservative daily Vienna "Who with whom?" In the article "The party presidents are stuck in coalition issues" deals with the confused Austrian internal political situation created following the elections.
SPÖ intends to deal with ÖVP.
ÖVP prohibits SPÖ's intervention in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to negotiations in all directions, the greens still do not want to discuss coalition.
The elections have been made, now rotates everything around the coalition; in the debate broadcast by the TV public the leaders of the parties have just shown the cards.
Werner Faymann President of SPÖ confirmed that he wanted to deal with ÖVP.
SPÖ wants to demonstrate that cooperation between the two parties is possible, in some regions and in social partnership already exists.
Faymann has left the question open if he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, current president of ÖVP, as vice Chancellor.
As stated, the Schüssel-Molterer course was rejected in any case.
The repetition of this direction is not considered.
Molterer reacted prudently to red offerings.
As he said, cooperation will certainly not succeed if Faymann tries to get into ÖVP's internal affairs.
If your party chooses the opposition or enters the coalition is still open in the party, the issues must be discussed in any case within the ÖVP.
Jörg Haider leader of BZÖ repeated being open in all directions.
"To prevent the red-black coalition we are ready to assume our responsibility to govern" - Haider said.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today in Paris the European Summit for Equal Opportunity began, organised this year by France with the Presidency of the European Union.
Lívia Járóka, MP Fidesz of the European People's Party in the message addressed to the plenary as the main rapporteur of the congress, drew attention to school segregation because it is the most serious legal violation affecting Roma children and the most serious obstacle to their affirmation.
Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, on behalf of the French Presidency, and European Commissioner Vladimir Špidla responsible for employment, social affairs and equal opportunities, opened the conference at the highest level.
Among those invited to the conference were the governments, the European social partners and representatives of the major European civil and rights organisations within equal opportunities.
Járóka, according to the press office of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, recalled, in addition to discrimination in recruitments, that the Roma are evicted from the labour market primarily because of their low schooling.
"Most Roma young people do not qualify as middle-level students and as a result of elementary education of poor quality only an ironic number of them can reach a higher degree of education."
Járóka also stressed, as a fundamental human right, the key role of education in promoting human rights.
Investing in the education of Roma children can mean strengthening the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the honourable Member, it is necessary to make aware of these links in the wider area between the Roma and non-Romans.
In fact, as soon as a Roma school starts, its chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market increase; through taxes paid for income and consumption contribute to the nation's budget.
"The right of European citizenship of the Roma must guarantee their right to quality education and the elimination of low-level and segregated schools" - stressed Lívia Járóka.
According to the honourable Member, the union of purpose and action of the European Union is necessary to speed up the process of disintegration of schools, and that is why it is essential to respect the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives.
"The vicious cycle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be interrupted, Roma children must be given the opportunities granted by the democratic space so that they can contribute as citizens in full title to the future of Europe" - he asked Járóka.
In the sign of the "European Year of Equal Opportunity" to ensure for all, the aim of the European Summit for Equal Opportunities organized every year, the Berlin meeting last year is to ensure a unique forum to promote anti-discrimination objectives and equal opportunities set at the state and European level.
CSU: mercy for a transitional period
At the end of October, the fate of the impassed Huber-Beckstein couple will be decided.
Although the bad election defeat has not yet fallen the heads, at the summits of the Bavarian CSU it has for the moment been postponed the discussion of personal matters.
The president of the Erwin Huber party and the regional governor Günther Beckstein still remain in their place, the question is as long as pity lasts.
The fate of the tandem that suffered a catastrophic loss of 17% votes will decide the extraordinary congress of the party in the last weekend of October.
The two very critical politicians have indicated in any case that they are not attacked with all the forces at the chair.
They have tried to soften the angry members of the parliamentary group and the base that one day after the "Tsunami Bavarian" claimed the personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
5 years ago, under Edmund Stoiber then at the height of his career, the Christian-social Union obtained 60.7%, now after the coup d'état against Stoiber fell to 43.4%.
The CSU for 46 years was "absolute monarch" in Bavaria which gives 18% of German GDP.
However, conservatives in the southern region are always of fundamental importance to the Hungarian economy, and in the future they will be forced to rally in every way.
As the first sign of the reorganisation within the party the vice-president and federal minister of Horst Seehofer Agriculture, considered possible heir to Huber, gets a place in the small exploratory group that will start negotiations with the FDP Liberals and with the Free Electors exhibiting right values for a possible government coalition in Munich.
For a strange joke of fate on the list of Free Electors enters the legislature that Gabriele Pauli whose attitude against Stoiber had been exploited as opportunities of coup by the Huber-Beckstein couple and then without regard to the woman from the great ambitions.
CSU leaders now concentrate all their forces to stabilize in some way Beckstein.
In the meantime, Stoiber will also play an active role, which so far had been in the shadows. The former regional governor and former president of the CSU defined on 28 September the bitterst day of his political career.
On Monday Huber issued some statements to the faithful towards the CSU, according to which they deserved more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
Merkel will not be able to become chancellor after the elections of the Bundestag set for September 2009 if the CSU that played a decisive role in the 2005 national victory will not be re-established with common forces.
According to Merkel, which does not hide the disappointment for the fiasco, the loss of land of the CSU will not adversely affect the great coalition of Berlin.
What is certainly relative: it will not be easy to manage the injured CSU, the crisis of the social democrats still lasts.
The SPD has achieved its lowest result since 1946 in Bavaria with 18.6%.
Lukashenko-opposition: 110-0
Not even one representative of the opposition entered the Belarusian Parliament after the Sunday elections.
According to Russian observers, it is the sign of well-being and stability guaranteed in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) it is explained with the errors committed in the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the elections.
Although the legislation of 110 people from a country of 10 million inhabitants has been unopposed for more than a decade, before yesterday's elections the opposition collected under the name of the United Democratic Forces (OSD) seriously hoped that Lukashenko, with the presidential mandate renewed for the fourth time following the constitutional amendment to the 2006 elections held under circumstances, would "give" some seats in Parliament to representatives of the opposition.
The SDO has thus given up a previously assessed boycott.
Behind the expectations of the opposition was that Belarus, increasingly economically dependent on Russia, which requested a credit to reduce the import of Russian natural gas ever more expensive and agreed to give Russian gas pipelines in possession of Beltransgaz crossing the country, intended to improve the relationship with the EU where Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians cannot enter into the political situation considered anti-democratic Belarus.
It referred to a detachment that the OSCE, evaluating the electoral campaign, had placed emphasis on positive movements rather than on shortcomings, such as the prohibition of applying for a third of the opposition candidates.
However, the OSCE's rapid report on Monday also criticised the campaign, during which the opposition candidates in practice could not appear on the press, and in particular that the opposition could not be present at the counting of votes.
Despite this opposition, an improvement in the political climate is noticeable: political prisoners have been released, Minsk is also prepared for a small comparison with Moscow by continuing to deny the recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia by Georgia, although Russia, with which Belarus forms a federal state on paper, has considered the two countries independent for a month.
We have taken two steps forward and one step backwards, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun - said to our newspaper Aleksandr Milankevich.
According to the presidential candidate for the 2006 election opposition, it is desirable that he remain despite the fact that "the power was afraid to bring even one opponent into a Parliament without weight".
The opposition does not provide for action to protest the results but rather tries to get voters the message of the need for economic reforms.
Of course we have many problems, we have to print the opposition papers in Russia, for distribution the local authorities raise difficulties, but also so I see that more and more people support change, even among the elderly - Milinkevich said referring to the fact that not even the most officially assisted ceto, that of the pensioners, considers the Lukashenko regime appropriate which considers its main result the creation of social security.
Due to the indebtedness of the country and the increase in economic deficit it is only a matter of time the breakdown of social security "which recalls sepulchre silence" - Milinkevich says.
Unlike the opposition politician, the Russian observers judged the elections democratic.
Sergej Lebedev President of the Community Independent States declared to the Russian press agency RIA Novosti: "Men believe not in words but in facts", so the lack of opposition is nothing but proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on breakfast before work"
It never happened in the history of Palazzo Chigi that there were turning doors for the entry and exit of employees.
But from now on, this new measure is taking place against the smarts, against those who stamp and then go for a coffee at the bar in the working hours.
The new anti-fannulloni was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary-General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"The swivel doors - says Brunetta - are a tool to work better, with more productivity, more presence and more services," said the minister.
"Now a new season of responsibility and transparency opens.
This is reformism," Brunetta points out.
With Palazzo Chigi completes the installation in all the palaces of the Presidency of the Council.
For Masi "the choice of rotating doors is also important from a symbolic point of view".
There has been no resistance from employees, the Secretary General assures: "It has been a process shared by workers and there has been the collaboration of all".
In short, no more breakfast on working hours; no more coffee and cornet.
Brunetta's word, which suggests, smiling, "a beautiful cappuccino at 7 a.m. is a holy hand".
During a conference at the Higher School of Public Administration
In Rome, the minister then makes known that "in three months the absences for public employees' disease have reduced by 50%, i.e. 60 thousand more people at work in one year".
And he adds that it is necessary to make Public Administration more efficient
Italian, "whose wage dynamics - explains the minister - in the last 8-10 years have been double compared to the private sector and well above inflation rates".
Meanwhile, thousands of public employees joined in challenging the rules of decree Brunetta by acceding to the appeal supported by Codacons.
"While the Minister of the Public Service is now disbanding numbers about the least absenteeism at work due to illness - the association of consumers writes - the people of 'operous mobs' is constantly growing.
In fact, there are thousands of employees of the correct and productive public administration in Italy who have joined together to declare war on the illegitimate rules contained in the decree."
In particular, the Tar will object to the exclusion of additional economic treatments due to illness dependent on the cause of service; the extension of the hours of the employability of the sick worker, within which inspection visits are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions required by the Minister.
Incidental work, Napolitano: "Criminal prevention"
Every day, in Italy, 2,500 accidents occur at work, 3 people die and 27 remain permanently disabled.
For 2007, the Inail data confirm that the white deaths were approximately 1,200.
Figures that testify to the gravity of a phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of death and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
In order to draw the attention of institutions, social forces and media on this dramatic issue, today Anmil celebrates in all provinces of Italy the 58th National Day for the victims of accidents at work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data disseminated by Anmil and the same tragic chronics of these days confirm how crucial the issue of job prevention is," said President Giorgio Napolitano, in his message to the president of Anmil, National Association mutilated and disabled workers, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his "live appreciation for the continued associative commitment to prevention in the workplace, the protection of injured workers, the assistance of the families of victims and the awareness of the public".
"It has, of course, been raised an outraged 'sufficient', sincerely shared, in the face of tragedies that, because of their size, provoke the outcry of the media and the involvement of public opinion but the daily reality presents us with dramatic, even repetitive cases in their dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly also a problem of resources: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
Particularly significant are the numerous initiatives promoted in school for a more direct awareness by young people facing the world of work.
It is necessary to keep an eye on the phenomenon alive, not to slow down in the alarm on its social gravity, apply and improve legislation.
For his part, the president of the Gianfranco Fini Chamber stressed that "as the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each of us and imposes on all institutions a determined commitment to bring you urgently to an end".
"The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive development, but this does not remove the number of white deaths from the work," said the president of the Amil Pietro Mercandelli.
"We do not want this "downward trend" to translate into less attention, because it is precisely when the attention is relaxed that the tragedy explodes.
"We believe that at the general level there is still too little to counter the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be exercised through multiple actions.
They are necessary, in our view - Mercandelli has emphasized - greater controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this from the world of the school".
"It serves a further effort - it has added - as regards communication and public awareness.
But above all, there is a need for a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli then denounced "the progressive deterioration of the levels of compensation provided for the victims of work" and the "assistantialism towards which the system has been moving in recent years".
"The aim is therefore to return to the worker the insurance guarantee - he added - because the fate of those who are injured must not depend on spontaneousness or enlargement from time to time arranged by the legislator".
Mp3 readers under charge, putting the hearing at risk
Listening to high volume music for an extended period of time using portable musical devices such as Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing injuries.
This is what the European Commission reports, which in a communication in Brussels refers to the opinion of the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Recently Identifying Health Risks (Csseri) of the EU published today.
"From this scientific opinion - read in the note - emerges that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable music devices weekly for more than an hour a day holding the high volume device risk a permanent loss of hearing ability".
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and mobile phones at high sound levels can unconsciously damage their hearing in an irreparable way," Meglena Kuneva says.
"From the scientific findings - the EU manager continues - there is a clear risk and we must react quickly.
More importantly, we need to raise awareness among consumers and make this information public.
We must also review existing control systems in the light of this scientific opinion in order to ensure that they are fully effective and keep pace with the new technology."
Brussels had asked the independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the large use of portable musical devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise caused by them.
"Scientists - the EU executive concludes - confirm that there is cause for concern and the European Commission will now examine together with the Member States and stakeholders what measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable musical devices and related equipment."
At present, there is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable musical equipment to 100 dB, but there are growing concerns about the auditory damage that may result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to limit these damage by using solutions such as reducing noise levels and duration of exposure.
In its opinion, the EU Scientific Committee notes that users of portable musical equipment if they listen to high volume (more than 89 decibels) music for only 5 hours per week exceed the limits currently in force for maximum noise permitted at the workplace.
Those who listen to music under these conditions for longer periods risk permanent hearing loss after a period of 5 years.
This would cover 5-10% of users of such devices and their number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, German gives way to the Commission for the future of the capital
Today we begin, in March we close, in June we will draw the sums.
This is the calendar set by the Campidoglio for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capital", which was established this morning in its new seat behind the Terme di Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will draw up the guidelines for Rome.
Once the workers are closed in March, the Junta and the Municipal Council will evaluate analyses and projects, so that they can present the Strategic Plan for Rome in June with the "official bubble" of the Campidoglio and its Mayor Gianni Germano.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and there have been all the political, social and cultural ideas - it wishes to stress German - will have to provide proposals for an idea of development of Rome, of which the political decision-makers, who remain the Council and the municipal council, will then be able to avail themselves.
There is no overlap of roles but only the will to have a place to develop a great project for Rome.
In March it will finish its work and then it will dissolve, because this experience must have a precise time period.
In June - announces the mayor - we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of Rome Capital".
To those who accuse the Commission of being useless, since its opinions will not be binding, Germany replies: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and on the quality of its proposals.
If quality will be there, as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am sure also in Rome, its contribution will be essential.
Too often, politics is breaking down on the management of daily life and on the emergences that are emerging from time to time.
On the contrary, we want to look longer and further, in a deeper perspective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future."
Moreover, the mayor of Rome wishes to point out that "this Commission is neither a useless entity nor a carriage: it is absolutely free, it will not cost the Roman citizens a euro and will serve to reason and involve the best intelligences expressed by the Capital".
For Germano, in fact, "it is necessary to have a strategic reference design, not closed or immovable, to allow our city to make a genuine leap of level, of which it absolutely needed, thinking in a spirit of unity to its future".
A future that, says the mayor of Rome "will not be limited to the present municipal boundaries but will look far beyond" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as Capital but also "in view of the role that Rome can and must play as Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama, the first anti-American president.
He wrote a well-known American politician who wants us to go independently: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions decimated the US economy and had relations (as he does today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam."
Attacks on Obama are increasing as the election date approaches.
He wrote a Miami lady on a website: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a big cough face: he believes he will win the highest position of a nation that has had in all two governors and five black senators!".
In fact, they are attacks that don't say much; they are attacks clearly racial in nature and do not respond to the voter's question: will it be a good president? Then there are polls; they all say that Obama will win and with good detachment.
Even in this case there are those who speak with their hearts but not their brains.
A newspaper in Mississippi, in the viscera of the southern United States, wrote an editorial: once in the cabin to vote we know well who will give his vote the American patriot.
Out comes one side of the American mindset covered up to the last.
"Tell me what you want, then we'll figure out where to put the cross, whether it's Obama or McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we'll leave America.
That never said before, which appears almost certainly the success of the black candidate.
However, despite all these reasonings, the winning weapon for democrats is George Bush.
They asked 1500 people: what were the mistakes made by Bush during his term of office? 89 percent answered: Iraq.
Change America.
In Vietnam this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was sent home to kick their asses.
In Iraq there are 4500 soldiers who lost their lives and Americans were not forced to pack.
Yet, Iraq for the majority was Bush's weakness.
Whoever takes the place of George W will have a huge task to perform.
Use, the economic shock is also felt on journalists: in newspapers it's time to cut. And many people blame the Internet, "murder" of the printed paper.
Fifteen hundred American journalists were interviewed by the PEW Research Center on the state of their profession and mental control as regards the future.
Well, today journalists are almost all pessimistic about their future.
However, the newsmen did not openly state that they felt less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like once.
The problem with American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a destroyed economic model crisis.
In addition, the cuts made in the newsroom, in the room where editors work to put the newspapers together, is a big problem.
It is a problem that needs to be resolved, according to the journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism as the general public intends is not to be reduced substantially.
A clear but complex pessimism pervades the American journalist today.
Six out of ten newspapermen and senior executives are convinced that national journalism is following a wrong path.
In the local field, the executive group is 65%.
Printed against broadcast.
It's not hard for journalists to see where the web is going.
The major publishing houses open up a gap towards the Internet, for many views as the "murder" of the printed paper.
The "economic pressure" that journalists warn has increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted that they are embracing technology in the hope that it will "do something good" for their journalism.
The biggest break in American journalism today is between those who run the newsrooms - i.e. the directors - and the reporters who work for them.
56% of executives at national level are sure that their reporters divide their values, while at local level the percentage falls to 23%.
For some, this has something to do with "work security".
Executives who think they lose their jobs within 3 years are at 47% at national level.
For the reporting staff, you go to 30%.
The "safe work" at the staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work with a contract.
In an immense nation like the USA, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and internet employers often offer what they want and thus become a matter of "take it or leave it", take or leave.
Directors receive almost always large wages, while the editor can earn even $10 thousand a month, in addition to pension and insurance payments.
For holidays, then, reasoning becomes complicated: all days after the first year, all after the third to reach 15 days overall after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, for their admission, often get sick during the year.
It's all about climate.
UNIPOL: THE COURT OF ROME, DANILO COPPOLA IS STILL GROTTAFERRATA
The president of the second criminal section of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the instance of the realtor Danilo Coppola who had asked to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a dwelling in the city of Rome.
Coppola is investigated for bankruptcy in the investigation of the Unipol-Bnl climbing counterpath.
In the course of his trial, last week, he was discharged from the domiciles converted into residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estate owner could travel from the town of the province to a house in the capital.
However, according to the court, these movements (to which he gave an opinion against the pm) would allow him to influence his company and access the evidence that they accuse him of.
The elites in danger
The phenomenon had already appeared a few days ago with the vote of the House of Representatives against the $700 billion rescue plan launched by the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and is, more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
There is a confirmation of the New York Times yesterday by informing us that the ongoing crisis is breaking up the Republican Party, increasingly divided among its old East Coast soul, moderate, favourable to federal institutions and business community, and its new soul, instead conservative, hostile to "those in Washington" and to the world of finance, strong especially in the states of Central and South.
The soul, for the most part, which became prepotently alive with the vote I said at the beginning.
This just mentioned, however, is just one example of the changes, of the big changes, which the current economic earthquake may or may already be announced: not only in the United States but throughout the West and perhaps not even here alone.
Both in the USA and in Europe the crisis seems to work as an incubator for a long time and in the new climate solidify and finally come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the up-to-date, the extraordinary relaunch, of the dual category of state-sovereignity in relation to a sort of renationalisation of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking-financial institutions which have, yes, close links with abroad, but which first of all are involved to a very large extent in the budgets of people and families living in a single country, in a single state.
This creates an immediate political problem for those who govern it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and families who, among other things, are also an electorate.
In other words, the crisis appears economically global but politically is almost exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems essentially out of play or not to have much to say: the overwhelming proof is given by the European Union which divides as usual between the different interests and between the different state strategies fails to decide any common policy line.
And so it is from the government of every single state that everyone expects to intervene, rescue and relaunch plans, new rules, and above all the provision of funds: since when you get to the narrows it is only the States that own economic resources, the mass of financial resources that can try to put things back into sixth.
They also have the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of immeasurable value, in certain circumstances, of which no market or international organization may possibly ever have similar resources.
This new emphasis that the crisis places on the state-national element is in perfect harmony with the increasing importance that the most recent developments in the economy tend to attribute to a factor which is very closely linked to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we had now entered the realm of the network, the increasingly sophisticated technology, the immaterial, while we were convinced that globalized finance was now destined to dominate the world, we realized a trait that our future would have to deal increasingly with those very little material things that are water, harvests, oil.
All things that, look a little, can certainly be transported from one place to another of the earth but are nevertheless absolutely linked to a restricted space, to a territory.
Because those who are to be sovereign possess certainly several more cards than those who are not, to those who have the misfortune to live in a place without harvests, without oil and without water.
I come to the second novelty, however, which predicts a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this respect the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective needs authoritative leadership, the request of someone who knows how to take the situation into hand.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leadership, economic species, proved to be so inadequate and full of shaded areas.
And together something even deeper and in a certain disturbing sense: a discredit, an inoffence, an image of inadequacy, a sense of remoteness, which tends to involve the entire ruling class in an increasing number of Western countries.
That is to say, it seems to us that, in large areas of the population, the conviction that before their actions are the same as the ideas of the social elites so far in the wake of the rise, their way of hearing and being, their culture in the overall acceptance of the term, their time and being increasingly foreign to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership, in short, feeds underground a branched but powerful movement of delegitimation of the ruling classes and traditional political structures, which manifests itself in the sudden "revolted" elections or in the sudden developments of the collective moods of the latter and recent times, from the conservative rise in Austria-Baviera to the collapse of the Labour Consensuss in Britain, to the rebellion of the American congressmen against Bush (and perhaps also the victory of the right in Italy has something to do with it).
It is felt that traditional elites, their parties, their programmes, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their formats would say someone, make it increasingly difficult to understand, and therefore to represent, what is not now taking shape in the deep layers of Western societies and that the economic crisis is reinvigorating, increasing, potentially stirring up.
In the face of all this talk of a 'rebellion of the masses' on the agenda would be frankly exaggerated.
But keeping your eyes open certainly isn't at all.
The Supertail to Walk on the Walls
Defeat the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in the future walk on the walls like Spiderman.
It is the goal of several American research centres and now a team of four institutions has gone very close to us.
With an adhesive of only 2.5 square centimeters, the scholars were able to hold a body of 100 kilograms on a vertical wall.
LO STUDIO – The American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of scholars is an evolution of existing ones that use a particular structure of carbon, called carbon nanotubes.
“The glue principle can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged as a pile of spaghetti,” explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the legs of the gechi, covered by microscopic hairs that can ensure perfect adherence to the animal.
The tests carried out on different materials, such as glass, Teflon and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles and at the same time "is easily removed from the wall", explains Liming Dai, researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
PATH TO DEATH? -"This material could be useful as a transitional adhesive» adds Liming Dai.
Perhaps to walk on the walls just like Spiderman? Perhaps so, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use such as the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and electric current.
Other applications could concern aerospace engineering.
For the moment no superheroes.
THE OTHER RESEARCH – The University of Berkeley in California is also looking for a new adhesive.
In an article on the magazine of the American Chemical Society, Californian scholars presented an adhesive made of microfibre as hair that self-cleans from dust during the movement on a surface to always maintain a perfect adhesion.
Pharmacists: Never with fruit juices
Attention to grapefruit juice, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed mainly in summer because seventeen and rich in vitamins, if taken simultaneously with some life-saving medicines alter their absorption by amplifying or decreasing, depending on the case, the efficacy with even serious health consequences.
Reiterating the risks of both packaged and fresh fruit juices associated with the use of certain medicines David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, who since the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia launches a new alarm: just a glass of grapefruit juice, orange and apple to reduce the absorption of some life-saving medicines, cancels the beneficial effects and endangers the health of patients.
The grapefruit juice had already been charged because it was considered responsible for increasing the effects of certain antiarrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, antistamine and neurological medicinal products to levels considered toxic.
RISK PHARMACI - The same Italian Medicine Agency reported on this in an information bulletin two years ago warning doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger arising from this mixture and to be careful about what they drink if they take medicines such as Diazepam or Metadone.
NOT ONLY PUMPELMO - According to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit medicines.
Along the list of active substances inhibited by the grapefruit and other juices.
From here the appeal of Michele Carruba, director of the Department of Pharmacology of the State University of Milan: "These discoveries are generally immediately reported to the various agencies of the international and national drug that may help to change the information notes of the drugs.
So always read the package leaflets of the medicines you take and if there is anything that is not clear, do not impress us but ask the doctor or pharmacist for clarification» said the expert to the agency Ansa.
Nobel Prize in Economics in Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize for Economics was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his studies on business models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a New Kenyan who teaches at the University of Princeton and is a well-known publisher of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration's foreign economic and political choices.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, on the days Enron failed, Krugman had planned in an editorial published in the New York Times that the second event would have been more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on the history of the United States.
A forecast that sparked not a few controversy and which for years was reintroduced to the economist, but which has now turned out to be accurate.
"I am surprised and also a little shocked at the speed at which the memory of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom disappeared from the public," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the executive committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "high-value economist", but also a divulgator with a "very aggressive style, particularly critical against the excesses of liberism of the Bush administration".
Open Office, here is the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
It is the day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the suite open source of personal productivity that aims to reach more and more users, from house to office, from professionals to public administration, as a free alternative to the most well-known Microsoft Office.
After almost a year's work by volunteer developers, behind which SUN Microsystem monitors, the new Open Office shows itself to the general public with different news: the welcome screen and the magazine interface and rendered less dispersed, add more substantial ones such as native compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF format (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest ISO standard.
Attention also to interoperability with the Office 2007, Open Office suite is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some specific features of some modules such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example for sending them by email, or the possibility to import PDF files into the graphical processing module, preserving the original appearance of the page.
Also on this front you can create "PDF hybrids", which accumulate the typical graphics of the Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or a text processor.
Collaboration is an element that has received several improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet you can intervene in multiple hands between different users, avoiding conflicts on changes, in the text processor, each employee is assigned a color in the comments for better recognisability in the review phase.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice features to the Web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they should release the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and added to the English version that was on the mirrors since Friday.
Besides for Windows and Mac OS, as usual the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request may also be sent to the home or at the workplace the installation cd.
And if the theme of gratuitousness can be a drag for the spread of homes, it is precisely in business that Open Office the suite tries the big bet, already relying on several projects made in the public administration and in schools.
And there is also the reality that offers an ideal training, advice and assistance service for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could open up business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for the word-respective videowriting; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for the powerpoint emulation presentations; Dbase, as in the case of the most famous Access is the program that allows you to work on the database; Draw, is finally the graphical module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that today we are almost 3 million and 600 thousand, with the release of the new version it is likely that you can also exceed the expected figure.
Kohl also turns out positive is the fourth case of doping
New case of positivity at the last Tour de France: this is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, the Gerolsteiner team, third ranked and winner of the best climber shirt.
To report the news is the website of the daily L'Equipe.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth positive runner in the Cera, the third generation Epo, after the Italians Riccardo Riccó and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, also from Gerolsteiner.
Kohl blood samples are among those carried out in recent weeks by laboratories in Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-analysis confirms the positivity in Cera, the Austrian will lose third place on the Tour and will meet at two years of canonical disqualification.
To confirm the news of Kohl's positivity to the third generation Epo is the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who informed the Associated Press that he had notified the Austrian authorities of the positivity.
The 26th Austrian year was placed on the final podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, also winning the best climber's peas shirt.
Immigrants: NEW YORK TIMES CALL, IS ITALY RAZZIST?
Italy "from the country of migrants has only recently become a privileged destination for immigrants" welcomed reluctantly.
This is turning the Belpaese into a nation of racists? It is what is asked in a long article the New York Times that has dedicated a long article to the debate on racism in Italy starting from the case of the young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso who was killed last month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case highlights what Nyt defines as the "north paradox": the northern regions are at the same time those where there is "more integration and more work" but also the "highest anti-immigrant feeling in the country and the highest support for the Northern League".
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants Nyt also cited the episodes of intolerance of Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only.
The new legislation required by the League that tightens the brakes on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of illegals is also cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
Trend emphasized by both the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano meeting Benedict XVI al Quirinale asked that the State and the Church work together to defeat racism".
Students victims of caro-rents up to 900 euros for one room
The rent market for university students knows no crisis.
According to Sunia's latest survey, the tenants' union, taking a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now taken very serious characters to the point to exclude entire bands of young people from the right to study for the very high overall costs that families of origin should support - explains the head of the study office of Sunia, Laura Mariani - in these cities the strong demand by students has so distorted the market to trigger a process of generalized increase also for residents".
In most cases the rental offers then contain a number of violations: free-type contracts, not registered, without limit of fee, linked sub-rents.
For Sunia, extraordinary measures are needed which, through the revision of the tax system, can reduce prices.
Looking at the details of the survey, we see that in Milan, for a place in the Brianza area, it takes about 450 euros; for a single room you go from a minimum of 650 (Blackband area) to an average value of 800 (Lambate, Udine and Fair area) to a maximum of 900 (in Victoria area).
In Florence a bed space costs on average 350/400 euros, one room about 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in areas close to the University, it takes 250/280 euros for a bed space in a double, from 370 to 500 for a single.
In Rome in areas close to central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) about 600 euros are requested for a single room, 450 for a double bed.
Values only slightly lower (550 euros for a single room) in areas close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecity).
It saves only if you move to peripheral areas: 300 euros for one bed and 450 a single in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar areas.
In Naples it takes 300/450 euros for one room to spend from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Polyclinic, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari for one bed space it takes 250/350 euros, at least 350 for one single.
In smaller cities prices are lower in absolute terms, but have a higher weight in the city economy.
In cities where the phenomenon of rents to extra-Community students is more frequent, as in Perugia, there is finally a further anomaly: the increase of about 25/30% of the fee requested to foreign students compared to that applied to Italians.
Goodbye old cinema Paradise, cities cancel the historical halls
Historical cinemas close in favor of the Multiplex.
"A city without cinema is a blind city, it's like a face without eyes."
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore photographers effectively what is happening in the large Italian urban centers but also in the cities of the province.
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the birth on the outskirts of the large multisalts and the consequent death by consummation of the monosals in the central areas of the cities, is one of those events that appear inevitable and incontrovertible but also has all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
To disappear are often historical places and loads of memory, "it is as if there were fewer a friend, a acquaintance with whom we shared a piece of road and lots of emotions", observes the director of New Cinema Paradiso, the film that twenty years ago brought to Tornatore the Oscar Prize and the Grand Prix of the Jury of Cannes, and that recounted the poetry of a province hall and nostalgia for a way to live the lost cinema perhaps forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the main association of the directors, speak clearly: in the last five years they have closed the 316 cinemas of the traditional type, and to pay the largest scotch are the salts in the main cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closures is Emilia-Romagna with 82 cinema monosala persi, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And to show that the first responsible for their disappearance is the advent of multiplex, these are the three Italian regions that have recorded the largest number of new multi-sala cinemas: 195 screens in more Lombardy over the last five years, 81 in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"The Italian exercise has developed irrationally", notes Paolo Protti, President of the Anec," it is useful to build new structures but it would be necessary to ensure the survival of those already existing, because when a city hall closes, not all its visitors are willing to move into multiplex.
Not to mention the lack of funding for the fund for the public sector: the state's previous debt is about EUR 10 million.
It is shameful, ethically and morally, that the government does not respect existing laws.
To support the sector it would be between 16 and 18 million euros a year".
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, concerned about the closures, has decided to run to the shelters with the signing of a protocol between Comune and Anec, the first of this type in Italy, to protect and promote monosala cinemas both in the historical centre and in the periphery.
Among the proposed rules are tax relief measures for managers and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the restricted traffic area and will have special rates for stopping and in some parking lots.
"It's an initiative that I like," observes Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by setting up other measures.
It is certain, however, that in order to counter the overpower of the traditional multiplex rooms, the quality of sound and image must also be improved, because the public today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the Bagheria Supercinema, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make "New Cinema Paradiso", which I had already thought of for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass before the Rialto or the Quirinale of Via Nazionale now closed, where I have experienced so many shared emotions, not to see the signs drowned by the dust I turn on the other side".
Links between politics and 'drangheta arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to uniform the choices of the Commune to the interests of the Piromalli Cosca."
The accusations are heavy that the magistrates of the Antimafia Directorate of Calabria address the mayor and vice- mayor of Gioia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external competition in Mafia association.
In hand also Gioacchino Piromalli, the old mediator between the clan and the public administrations, and his grandson lawyer, homonym of the boss, already condemned for association to criminalize a mafia stamp, condemned to compensate 10 million euros.
"In contempt of any legal and moral norms as well as common sense," the prosecutors wrote, the two local administrations had expressed their desire to pay counsel to lawyer Piromalli.
"It would have been so granted to the cosca - the judges write - to officially enter the municipalities by facilitating the possibilities, already large, of control and address of the public administration."
The president of the Calabrian regional board Agazio Loire does not hide that "collusions between local authorities and organised ill-treatment there are several" in his region: "There are areas where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where the collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressures of 'drangheta, heroes who remain clean".
This morning's arrests follow those of July with which the police announced that they had beheaded the Piromalli Cosca.
Since the end of April, the city council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved but already in 1991, and always because of alleged conditions between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been raised by the task of administering the Municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of Udc at the time of the dissolution, had been elected head of a centre-right coalition, after the May 2006 ballet.
He cried out to the scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He called in question the then Deputy Minister of the Interior Marco Minniti, accusing him of having built everything up for a political issue, but the judges, in the arrest warrant signed this morning, explain that the Piromalli Cosca had even come to ask for the variation of the project of the A3.
From the environmental interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, the PMs write, emerged "the willingness to marry the needs of an entrepreneur, representing a larger group notoriously close to Piromalli, uniforming the choices of the public administration to the interests of the shell".
When the energy is born from the waves now the big ones go down in the field
It is a deadbed, which occupies more than 70% of the planet's surface and is now being discovered by large global energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources on which they put their eyes, and now try to put their hands, colossal like Chevron.
The possibility of obtaining energy from sea movements has been studied for hundreds of years and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
When the price of oil fell around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was put aside, but now the environmentalist instances and the new increase in oil give impetus to the sector.
London's World Energy Council (WEC) estimated in 2007 that 15% of the world's electricity needs could be covered by offshore motorcycle exploitation facilities.
This amount would be twice as high as that currently produced by nuclear power plants.
And besides, there would be currents and tides.
Colossi to the attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy was the Energy, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build a plant in northern Portugal.
When the agreement was announced it seemed a revolutionary step.
Two years away to bet on marine energy are increasing and among these companies have always voted on traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying the technologies on ocean energy - he has declared the spokesman of a company associated with the US oil colossus to the economic newspaper Wall Street Journal - and is evaluating the possibility of cooperating with us".
The cooperation in question concerns obtaining a permit from the United States Energy Committee, which is necessary to launch a project for the exploitation of marine energy in Alaska.
It is a signal not very soon, especially if it is considered that in Alaska the U.S. continue to extract oil and recently President Bush has launched a plan for new fluctuations.
In addition to Chevron there is the Verdant Power Inc. of New York and the Ocean Power of New Jersey to travel the way of energy coming from the sea and the sums invested so far, as not known in detail, indicate an interest in rise by observers.
Technology to be developed.
Experts are talking about technology at dawn, also because marine energy does not escape all doubts about the environmental impact.
For now plants such as the Portuguese one or some in Scotland are small and do not seem to create major problems to the ecosystem.
In order to produce large-scale energy, however, technologies must be used with greater environmental impact.
And the choices are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a boe system connected to each other.
The impulse of the waves, which moves the boes up and down is converted into hydraulic pressure from pistons and cylinders inside the floaters.
Pressure spins a turbine that in turn feeds a generator.
Electricity is sent to shore through submarine cables.
For now there are four plants of this type in the process of design, only pending federal approval and some of the energy could be used for military installation.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces energy for a shopping mall and parking using six submarine turbines in the East River of New York.
The movement of water when there are tides spins the blades of turbines, creating a rotating movement that feeds a generator.
Verdant said she has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to take advantage of energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say to the Institute for the Research of Electricity, is currently worth the potential of tides.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is precisely about the energy of the tides that have been like that of New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others overlooking the coasts, they have already invested $7 million and a half in 2008 and planned investments up to 35 million for 2009.
