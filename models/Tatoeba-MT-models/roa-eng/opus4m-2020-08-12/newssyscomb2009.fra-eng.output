Right-wing populists triumph in Austria, they have 29 percent total
According to preliminary results, the early parliamentary elections in Austria have brought a significant weakening of the two parties forming the present great coalition, as well as a notable strengthening of the populist parties.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), where current President Wilhelm Molterer's position is seriously threatened, has suffered particularly significant losses.
On the other hand, the electoral leader of the Union for the future of Austria (BZÖ), the governor of Carinthie Jörg Haider, prepares a triumphal return on the political stage at the national level.
According to preliminary results, the Socialists (SPÖ) remain, with 29.8 per cent of the votes, the country's first political force, however, compared to the 2006 elections, they lost 5.5 per cent of the votes.
The ÖVP, which with 25.6 percent loses almost nine percent of the votes, ended even worse.
These are the worst results of the two major post-war parties; particularly for the popular party, which triggered the anticipated elections, the result is literally catastrophic.
In early July, when the ÖVP left the coalition, the popular party had a considerable advance on the SPÖ.
But the electors punished them visibly for letting the government collapse.
From the first responses to the results, speculations about the possible resignation of the party leader and current vice-chancer Wilhelm Molterer were made.
Observers believe that this could happen on Monday at the extraordinary board of party leadership.
Such a development would facilitate a priori the path towards the outcome of the most likely election, namely the renewal of the large SPÖ and ÖVP coalition.
However, given the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the free parties (FPÖ) would have obtained 18 per cent and BZÖ eleven per cent of the votes - the socialists also expressed the fear of a repetition of 1999, when the popular party agreed with the populists (at the time, the FPÖ was still unified, it was in 2005 that the BZÖ separated) on a common government, which even raised sanctions on the part of the European Union.
Haider, who has already stated that he was ready to collaborate with any party and that he planned to return to Vienna, on the national political stage, apparently put on this development.
The last party to have access to the parliament being the Greens, but the Greens slightly lost and returned, among the Austrian political parties, from the third in fifth position.
Obviously, no other party passes the four percent limit and does not access the parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relationships with India are likely to cool down
If the problem of the Czech researchers accused in India, accused of illegal harvesting of cafards could not be resolved, the Czech Minister for Foreign Affairs Karel Schwarzenberg said that there would be a certain cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
The Minister told him today in New York, after meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranaab Mukherjee.
"If the problem had not been resolved, then yes, a certain cooling would have occurred," he noted after the meeting, followed by a Czech initiative.
Ms. Mukherjee said, by coming out of talks, that the executive power could hardly intervene in judicial matters.
He mentioned, however, that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was dismissed from the charge and punished with a fine, the central government could negotiate with the local government, that of Darjeling, the case being placed under its jurisdiction.
"Your problem could be resolved," said the Minister.
According to Mukherjee, the best solution for Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, would be to appeal to a higher court.
Therefore, he could ask for bail and wait for the trial to be released, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirms that his partner also expresses himself in the same direction during the talks.
"He advises to appeal to a higher court, after which he could be granted grace," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way in which the Czech side can intervene in this case is to provide convicted persons with "competent legal support," the Indian minister said.
He also said that such aid had already been provided to them by India.
"We wish above all to maintain the best relations with India, which have a tradition continuing over many years.
The Indians also recognize him," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he said to ČTK, he emphasized to his partner that the Czech Republic attached great importance to the problem of Czech entomologies.
"We regard the incarceration and prosecution of these Czech researchers as a great contempt," he said.
The Minister evades the question of whether he has obtained from India the promise to deal with the matter.
"I have already received quite a number of promises," he observes only.
An Arbitrary Czech Fight for the Seabed
It is approaching an electronic wall map, on which Australia and adjacent marine areas are represented.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but at a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia, as well as the adjacent seabed.
However, this area is as large as the continent itself," said Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the team of the thirty members of the United Nations Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea.
His head, the division director, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the presentation and the complete one from time to time.
The ardor at work and enthusiasm characterize the prevailing atmosphere.
The seabed hides a little known world so far, rich in natural resources.
Oil, minerals and other mineral resources can be found there, but also living organisms for the time being unknown, which can contain the key to the development of a cancer drug.
A larger fund than the land
Coastal states have begun to vehemently aspire to new submarine territories today.
According to a United Nations convention, they used their rights, on which they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of what is called the continental Shelf, which often extends to several hundred kilometres from the coast of the given country.
The latter may, according to the Convention, claim exclusively to all the resources of the continental Shelf.
"To simplify, the part of the seabed and its basement, which constitutes a natural extension of the continent under the sea, is considered as a continental shelf.
It extends beyond the boundaries of the coastal sea, often also beyond the two hundred thousand marines that represent the so-called exclusive economic one," Mikulka explains.
The request submitted by the country concerned to the Commission for the establishment of the outer borders of the continental Shelf must be supported by extensive scientific and technical documentation, based on many expensive perspectives and metrics.
It is the result of several years of preparatory work.
"One of our roles is to provide the commission with legal and scientific-technical assistance.
To date, the Committee has dealt with five requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For the time being, only the last three countries mentioned have been successful," adds Mikulka.
Australia's success, which is the first to have significantly expanded its underwater assets, has recently experienced a global downturn.
New Zealand, too, has gained from the territory - the extent of the seabed, allocated to it last week by the commission, corresponds to 1.6 million square kilometres, which represents the extent of the country multiplied by six.
Both countries invested millions of dollars in prospecting.
The benefit they will reap in the future from the exploitation of the seabed will, as they project, be invaluable.
In turn, other countries will progressively submit their request.
They may do so within ten years after ratifying the "Montego Bay Convention".
There, where the continental Shelf ends, begins the area of the oceanic background, proclaimed by convention "common heritage of humanity".
There, no longer any state enjoys an exclusive position.
The right of extraction in this area is conferred by an international institution established by convention.
"However, we are not mistaken, the seabed is not a Klondike," says Director Mikulka, saying that "its areas are clearly defined and their regime is embedded in a contract."
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic today.
It shares it with other states in the former L'Est bloc within the framework of the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
In 1991, under the Convention, as well as investors from a few other states, it obtained the status of the one called "a pioneer investor".
It has the right of extraction in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, Hawaii Islands and Kiribati.
The area envisaged by the investor slightly exceeds the area of the former Czechoslovakia.
The background is enlivened there, it's a kind of underwater replica of the Tatras.
"It is possible to extract it from an extent with a total area of 75,000 square kilometres.
The area represents a deposit rich in polymetallic concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," lists Ind Pakshi Rajan, another lawyer.
Rober Sandev, a Macedonian employee of the division, provides an example of such a realization.
It recalls a small potato, or, with a little imagination, the legendary Shoem, which, according to legend, animated the Golem.
The German Special Forces were on site for the release of hostages
The Egyptian government had called for Germany's help in resolving the hostage crisis - experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special units remained ready but never proceeded to action.
More and more details on the circumstances of the release of eleven European tourists abducted in Egypt are being revealed.
According to the instructions of the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defence, the German special forces also participated indirectly in the rescue operation.
For example, both federal army specialists and GSG 9 officials from the federal police and federal criminal police officers' air raid squad, as well as technical logistics experts from Technischen Hilfwerk were at the point of release.
As the Ministry spokesperson communicated it on Monday night, the German forces were not finally required, the hostages who freed their prisoners and fled when they recognized the imminent release by force.
The Egyptian government would have accepted Germany's aid to integrate it on-site as a support force.
"It hasn't arrived so far," said a spokesperson of the Ministry of the Federal Interior.
The attackers had abducted the group of tourists consisting of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and their eight Egyptian companions in the south of Egypt.
After their abduction in the desert south of Egypt, the hostages were transbaked into the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of hostage holders has remained so far vague, as have the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Those who have been saved are in the meantime arrived healthy and except in Cairo.
Steinmeier stated that the hostages released were under the protection of the German Embassy.
He didn't say anything about the details of the release.
No information has been given at the moment in Berlin on the date of their return to Germany.
According to the magazine "Bild", the five vacationers and the special forces should have taken off on board an Airbus of the Air Force and arrived in Germany Tuesday.
The United States House of Representatives rejects the rescue plan
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress recently failed the $700 billion heavy financial market rescue plan.
The Dow Jones was crawling into the abyss.
With 227 votes against 206, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the rescue plan for the government's financial markets.
Despite all the calls made by the President of the United States George W. Bush and political men at the head of both parties, the program that had to stem the chaos of financial markets did not achieve a majority.
In a dramatic maneuver, the partisans desperately tried to convince the opponents of the base property of this $700 billion heavy plan.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic representatives during the debates, had called for a favourable vote, although the plan was unpopular.
"It is difficult to have political recognition for avoiding something that has not yet happened," he said.
During the vote again, Dow Jones fucked more than six percent or 600 points.
The reason for this was the concern of the investors that the state rescue plan could generate.
He returned shortly before the end of the vote, and then, after the announcement of failure, fell again.
Experts are now planning serious new turbulences in international financial markets.
In order for the program to enter into force, approval and approval of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate are required.
Organizers report an increasing number of reservations
This should be a good winter for German travel agencies:
With regard to reservations for the next few months according to a study, turnover has increased significantly compared to the previous year - for the winter season, even more than 30 percent.
Despite weak cyclical prospects, the thirst for German travel remains unsatisfied in this study.
With regard to reservations for the winter season, travel agencies recorded a turnover of more than 31 per cent compared to the same period the previous year, as entrusted to the German Federation of Travel Agencies (DRV) on Monday in Berlin.
According to the GfK Market Research Institute survey, increasing numbers of reservations already dominate in the fall months.
Thus the sales figure would have risen to about 11 per cent compared to 2007, according to the RVD.
The sources of these results are the GfK figures, which monthly analyses the booking data of 1200 travel agencies and makes estimates for the global market.
Travel bookings made since the end of August 2008 would be recorded.
Due to the low dollar rate, travel to the USA would be particularly requested, the DVR declared.
There, the increase in reservations would amount to about a third party.
Apart from this, Spain, Turkey and Greece and our country would be especially sought after by the Germans.
Specially organized travel is very requested, explained the President of the DRV Klaus Laepple.
In view of rising energy and food prices, the costs would be "more easily calculated for the customer than for an individually organized trip".
Consumers can save money, among others, with early booking reductions or All Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months have also been highly retained so that an increase in sales figures will be reregistered compared to last year - although according to another study, the number of Germans who undertook a trip decreased compared to the previous year.
My first time at the beer party
The hits of Ballermann or After Ski continuously, from beer in pickets to litre and celebrities in Tyrolian designer costumes.
An event at the beer party.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I didn't actually have much in common.
She is blonde, TV entertainer and wears a custom-made tyroline costume.
I have dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is on occasion.
But one thing connects us: just three minutes to the beer party, and already the photographers throw themselves on us and fill their memory card - very flatter, and this on my first visit to the beer party.
That's how we make friends.
The cheap tyroline costume seems to achieve its goal.
As a tourist at the beer party and normally resident north of the Weißwurst equator, my sense of well-being in the traditional costume has so far been limited.
But once on Thérèse Square, everything is half the worst.
Each or almost wears a tyroline suit or leather pants; no one looks blasphemed or embarrassed - it's completely normal.
Only the tabular of my Tyrolian costume harvests a few odd eye strokes at the banana-chocó stand.
A Bavarian woman pointed out that I would have badly attached my tablar: "to the left means free, to the virgin, to the broken right, to the back of the widow."
Discreetly, I triple my loop from the back to the left.
"It's better," she says and laughs.
Others don't give themselves so much harm for these subtle flirtation techniques and wear simple felts, on which is written "Too run to get dressed!" and exposes us their bare back-train without being invited.
The young man with an exhibitionist attitude is called Bob, comes from England and comes for the first time to the beer party.
He finds it "gorgeous", with an "ooooo" lengthened.
He told me all this after he had relieved himself of the cup he had drunk before.
Directly next to this firemouth that everyone thinks is a trash can.
So Bob is one of those notorious "wild pessors."
Others don't have the chance to get rid of alcohol that way.
Around eight o'clock in the evening, rescuers run on the place of the party and have to take care of the poor drinkers.
The nurses intervene rather in moiety - still by four, they drag their cider covered in tent tents.
It works like this for most visitors at the beer party: we're going empty, we're going back full.
Those who rest in the coffin of burrows under the deck are not visible.
"These are the ones who can no longer swallow," one of the rescuers shouted in response to my question and then disappeared in the mix.
Accident victim identified by the police
A 63-year-old pedestrian who died in the hospital after being hit by a vehicle was identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road to Brentwood, was involved in the Friday after noon accident in town on Shenfield Road.
She was transported to Queen's Hospital, Romford, but then she died.
As a result of the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested because he was suspected of dangerous conduct.
He's been released since, on bail.
Turkey broadens its diplomatic horizons.
Long before Turkey was planning to join the European Union, the European powers were looking forward to entering its backcountry.
On the east side of Bosphora, 20 steps from Asia can be one of the finest relics of its fallen imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha station was designed in a neo-renaissance style by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu.
That's at least what the guides tell us.
The monument is set on horseback at the bottom of the platforms, equipped with an observation tower at each angle, such as some German provincial municipalities.
The stones are dirty.
The whole building is in ruins.
But once inside the vaulted ticket office, we have no more doubt about the size of the company, which represents a passage to the west.
The station was inaugurated in August 1908 by a German association, the Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a retardant to the game of imperialism, wished to realize its medieval ambitions of domination thanks to this railway arriving in Damascus, Baghdad and has the most known land as Saudi Arabia.
But German imperialist ambitions collapsed during World War I.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arab irregulars.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, is over.
. The British and the forces of the empire advanced beyond Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
But there was also bad news for the Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, a train loaded with ammunition exploded and destroyed its subtle roof.
The Turkish sources state that this is sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly fallen into ruin, swallowed up in the middle of history.
Today, however, the rail crossing to Anatolia and all the eastern points, at least symbolically, serves to highlight the expansion of Turkey's diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the AKP, has created a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War
Now is the time for a new commitment policy.
The Turkish government has remarkable relations with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian fractions of Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To judge the parameters of this new foreign policy, I boarded a car-bed in the direction of the Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit the Turkish MP AKP Suât Kinikilioglu, one of the experts in foreign policy.
The next morning, after a ten-and-a-half-hour trip, rocked on noisy tracks whose cadence reminded the old world of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I finally arrived, in the Turkish capital- presented as a new city of a new secular state, turning its back to its German past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamic roots represents an example of a change in Turkish consensus.
He suspected the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi accompanied me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra modern structure, specifically built in stone and steel, in a developing neighborhood, surrounded by half-built shopping centres and many pastries in which middle managers in men's and women's men's costumes meet for morning business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could have been a right centre politician from any other party in Europe.
Wear, tie and he even has a Black Berry.
"The aim of this foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighbourhood.
Cold War was an anomaly," he said.
Turkey has been cut off from its back country.
Now she must look east and west at the same time.
That wasn't the case with each other.
She had to do both.
"but, at a certain point, "I asked if" Turkey shouldn't choose?"
"Turkey," he said, "doesn't want to have to choose between the two."
He then pointed out one aspect that almost all those with whom I could speak, they said by heart: The Turkish railway is not only going to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus, and around the Black Sea, so it is an advantage for Europe and the United States as well as for Turkey itself.
With the integration of Turkey, the message seems to draw a metaphorically travelling Europe on the tracks to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha station, after another sleepless night, I thought of these two Germans, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who followed the construction of this building 100 years ago.
They would have been surprised to see that the European ambitions of the Middle East could largely be in the hands of Turkey.
While I was waiting at the terminal, the ferry to cross the Bosphora, I remembered the period during which Turkey had been called "the sick of Europe".
At least there is no doubt about the continent that could claim this fascinating country.
Memories by Vernon Handley, and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: Director of Music at Guildford since 1962, Vermon "Tod" Handley (died September 11th) was responsible for Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Already taking advantage of his musical project for the city, he founded the following year, the fantastic choir of young people, Proteus.
The choir was to include those under 21 years of age, but before Proteus could sing his last song in 1979, many of us who were over 20 years old refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (which changed shape according to mythology) represented the desire and ability of the choir to manage any type of music, whether Madrid or Messianic.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often impressive, always exciting, thanks to the inspiration of one man, and his enthusiasm for music, which remains constant over the years.
Remember how much Tod told us to "let the music speak for itself".
He would have said, "The composer knows what he wants"
It's all there, in the music.
So sing!"
His rod technique was absolutely clear, precise, even if never dictatorial or appearing.
Whatever the musical standard, he raised it a lot higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If a driver was to be named a knight, that's Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the decades 1962 to 1982, when he was driving the Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the past 40 years, I've seen more than a hundred of his concerts, and I can honestly say that none of them have ever disappointed me, and sometimes they even inspired me.
Tod Handley owned such a rare combination of personal size and modesty.
He hated drivers who, in his view, "focus only on certain people".
Many of us will be missing.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary by William Woodruff (died September 25th) states that "in 1946 he had resumed his studies in economic history in Oxford, and became a member of Houblon-Norma research in 1950 while he was doing a BSc, MA and PhD."
That's what came from Woodruff's letter to Beyond Nab End, but that's not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor in economic history at the University of Nottingham, and at the same time ended a PhD thesis on the British plastic industry, under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers; it was then published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
In the 1950s and 51s in the United States, he studied at the Norman Houblon, and in the summer of 1952, at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason Woodruff chose to conceal this part of his past remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino " the Flamenco and life " because his photographs in black and white, a documentary style, are fantastic.
They drew attention to me because of their simplicity and the strength they transmit and because they always treat the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that conveys a lot of feelings.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments."
Second assault on Honda's super sales
In November Honda will begin marketing the second generation of the Jazz model.
If its predecessor already had a good habitability, this new monovolume has an even wider interior space.
This adds some refined mechanics, which increase the comfort of driving and save more gasoline.
An evolution in the face of a revolution.
So this is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Honda Jazz presents a line very similar to the previous model, the changes introduced in this monovolume are numerous.
Among them, there is an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
However, before considering the new model, it should be emphasized that this new Honda Jazz comes six years after the first generation is placed on the market.
First of all, it is noted that Honda has renovated this model within a shorter time limit than other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, Honda Jazz is less known, this model is a phenomenon of sales in other markets.
This is the case with Japan, where Honda Jazz was the most commercialized car in 2002 and also in 2008.
Precisely in Japan, nearly one million Honda Jazz have been sold since its launch.
The Old Continent, with about one million cars sold in six years, represents the second place.
However, Honda claims that this new Jazz will allow him to increase his sales in Europe.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese brand marketed 83,000 Honda Jazz, in 2009 it thought of selling 100,000, which would represent a 17% increase in sales on the European market.
On the Spanish market, Honda has marketed 8,000 Jazz since 2002 which accounts for 6.7% of Honda's sales in Spain.
Spanish branch officials hope to sell 2,000 Jazz in one year.
It is precisely the exit of the new Jazz that will allow Honda to reduce sales in Spain to a large extent.
In fact, brand leaders hope to end the year with a sale of 22,000 cars, i.e. 4,000 cars less than in 2007, a 16% decrease in sales.
As a result of this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain, reaching a market share of 1.8 per cent, compared to 1.6 per cent last year.
The Japanese brand also hopes to obtain a market share of 2% in 2010.
Honda hopes to get this market share when the new model comes out.
It is the Insight, a five-door hybrid and a compact size - 4.37 meters long - on which the Japanese company hopes to market nearly 200,000 cars per year worldwide.
Depending on the markets and the Japanese manufacturer's estimates, 50% of Insight's sales will be made in the United States, while the remaining half will be distributed between the Old Container and Japan.
Insight's commercial launch is scheduled for the first three months of next year, after its presentation to the public in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz increases its dimensions.
Its length is 3.90 metres (five centimeters in excess), its width is 1.69 metres (two centimeters in excess) and the distance between its axes is 2.50 metres, which represents an increase of five centimeters.
On the other hand, the height does not change to 1.52 meters.
Dimensions increase and interior space also.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the introduction of a new platform and, on the other, to the introduction of a petrol reserve in a central position, a solution also adopted for Honda Jazz.
In the same way, the capacity of the chest - which has a double background system - can contain up to 399 litres, 19 litres of capacity in excess of the first generation chest.
It should be noted that these dimensions are those of the version with a 1.4L engine, since the capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2L chest is 379 litres.
The other innovation - in addition to external elements such as rear lights or panoramic roof - is improving access to rear seats.
The doors that give access to the rear seats have an opening angle of 80 degrees, relative to the back doors of the first Jazz that were opened at an angle of 67 degrees.
The engines are also new on this second generation of Jazz.
At the beginning of its commercialization, this small model will be equipped with two petrol thrusters of 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
Both engines have an i-VTEC technology that reduces gasoline consumption and CO2 emission, which makes the engine more powerful and increases engine speed.
The first engine 1.2 litres develops a power of 90 horses at 6,000 tr/min and 114 Nm torque at 4,900 tr/min.
This propeller - which on the previous Jazz reached 78 horses - has a petrol consumption of 5.3 litres per 100 km and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous propeller, which over the previous generation reached 83 horses, now reached 100 horses.
This 100-horse Honda Jazz 1.4L has combined consumption of 5.4 litres per 100 km and 128 grams CO2 emissions.
The 'bee car' that avoids collisions
In order to advance the development of technologies for accident prevention, Nissan drew this time from nature, especially bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, by imitating the flight of bees, avoids accidents.
It is called Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C and represents the first steps towards collision prevention technologies.
Engineers at the Nissan Motor Co. Advanced Technical Centre have developed this little robot in collaboration with the Centre for Advanced Science and Technology Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, the Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Research and Development of Trademark Management, BR23C represents the rise of the Nissan Security Shield.
This robot will allow branded vehicles to prevent collisions.
During its flight, each bee created its own personal space of an oval shape that looks much like the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important is the compound eyes of the bee, able to see in an angle of more than 300 degrees and in all directions, which allows it to fly without interruption within its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, the engineers developed what is called a laser locator (Laser Range Finder).
It detects obstacles within a distance of two metres and within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to that object and sends a signal to the microprocessor immediately to avoid the obstacle.
"When he detects an obstacle, the little robot will imitate the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by forging his wheels 90 degrees or more to avoid collision.
The greatest difference from any other existing system is that the escape maneuver is totally instinctive.
If that were the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, Director of the Movement Laboratory and Chief Engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be diverted upwards or downwards, or diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and depending on what its wheels allow it and not in infinite directions like bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, but also acceleration and deceleration, so that the little robot can avoid obstacles.
" Every second this device must only process information and act according to that data.
It does not need to retain the information or intuitive logics of prior manoeuvres, that is why it can function continuously with only a few dozen KB of memory.
This may surprise us, but we are not talking about giga-bytes of memory or even megabytes."
This represents the first because of the development of new instant collision prevention technologies, a technology that will be introduced into serial cars in about ten years after Nissan.
The robot runs with lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion batteries.
The other possible application of this technology in the future could be the adaptation of this device to a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to his destination by avoiding road obstacles.
They're afraid to be mortgaged.
It must be acknowledged that the United States Treasury, in addition to having a lot of liquid to make plans, is not without engineering.
Faced with the crisis, and to prevent Americans from embarking on mortgages with solvency banks, they created a game to learn not to fail: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
That is 'the Hotel of Bad Credits' ... or stories.
The grim aspect of this accommodation and especially of the Master of the Hotel leads us to think on several occasions if this is the right time to apply for a loan.
And, above all, where to do it.
It is certain that this game provides useful but little detailed information.
It's more a game for teenagers.
What to do if the game ends?
Since a dream room appears inside the hotel.
It's better than nothing, because it's unthinkable to buy a house
Morgan Stanley opens its capital at MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entrance to his table at Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan's first bank, which will pay nine billion dollars to take 21% of its capital, a new one welcomed by a sharp decline in its scholarship course.
One week after the opening of a provisional agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG was going to purchase 9.9% of the regular shares of Morgan Stanley at a unit price of $25.25, or a total amount of $3 billion.
The price chosen is less than 19 per cent than the accounting value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG will invest $6 billion in the acquisition of convertible securities with a 10% return and a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley stated that the overall operation would be based on an average unit price of $29, which is 28% above its current course.
However, Morgan Stanley lost 6.79% to $23.07 around 5.00 GMT.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to bank holding status," said John Mack, the director general of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new status last week, which must enable him to diversify his activities but to pass it under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
Its alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street's biggest names to adopt a much more prudent attitude than before.
The terms presented on Monday also show that the agreement has been modified over the last few days: on Monday, Morgan had simply announced that he would sell up to 20% of his shares in Japan for approximately $8.5 billion.
"A week ago, he explained to Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, MUFG's Executive Director, "we consider that participation would be entirely made up of ordinary actions.
But in view of the current situation in the economy and the market, we wanted to minimize the risks and cover ourselves."
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley 7% securities below their accounting value.
And the operation will translate into a dilution of about 20% of the profit per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert in one year half of its preferred shares into ordinary shares if they exchange more than 50% above the conversion price of approximately $47 for a given period.
Morgan Stanley ensures that the capital provided by MUFG will allow it to seize investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
However, one panel spokesperson refused to provide details on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After MUFG's investment, Morgan Stanley is expected to display a Tier One solvency ratio of approximately 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan said he had "directly" relieved his balance sheet since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been proving for the group, who saw his scholarship course melt half while the cost of insurance against a risk of default on his debt was flying.
This cost was dropped on Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" of the large investment banks on Wall Street after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch, announced that he had raised $15 billion, in part from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa to Quito this Monday.
Refound the republic around the socialism of the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, like its counterparts and friends, was the third one to put to the vote a draft new Constitution.
Mission accomplished since 64% of voters voted "yes" to the referendum, according to official results covering 80% of votes.
According to these results, the "no" obtained 28%, 7% of the votes were zero and 0.7% were white votes.
For the draft Constitution to be adopted, it had to obtain half of the votes plus one.
On Sunday, two polls were carried out at the polling stations and a count of a non-governmental organization had announced a large "yes" victory, between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had also claimed on Sunday night to Monday the victory of his draft Constitution.
The "Constitution has triumphed dramatically," he assured, congratulating Ecuadorians at the seat of the governorate of Guayaquil, 280 kilometres south-west of Quito.
As of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales as well as his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which took place in calm according to the Organization of American States (OAS) observation mission, focused on a text in 444 points consolidating the "new socialism" defended by the president.
The draft Constitution enshrines the power of the State over the economy by providing it with the "development planning" of a country which is essentially living from the extraction of oil by foreign companies and foreign currency sent by its emigrants.
The project, elected by Correa in 2006, also grants strengthened powers to the Head of State, which will be able to carry out up to two consecutive four-year terms and will have the opportunity to dissolve the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that it will use this power and will conduct a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution further consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the President has begun to establish in that country of 13.9 million people, where 50% of the population live below the poverty line.
Finally, it provides for a ban on the presence of foreign troops, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as the starting point for US drug operations.
The 19 hostages were released in Chad
An Egyptian commander launched the assault on the captors of the eleven tourists and their eight escorts captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts held captive for ten days in the desert were brought back this Monday afternoon healthy and except in the Egyptian capital.
In the morning, they had been released by an Egyptian commando in Chad.
Apparently in shape, the hostages arrived about 1530 hours on board a special aircraft at the military base of al-Maza, hosted at Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately transferred, without being able to speak to the press, on board helicopters to the Maadi hospital, a residential suburb of Cairo, for examinations.
They are in "good health", and "no ransom has been paid" to the captors," said Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoeir Garanna on the tarmac.
Captured on September 19 at a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, at the border of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been smuggled from one to another by 35 unknown captors.
It includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, one border guard and the director of the Aegyptous agency, organizer of the safari.
An Egyptian security officer indicated that 30 Special Forces members, on board two helicopters, had launched the assault in the night just before dawn.
"An exchange of shots has occurred, and half of the raptors have been killed, the others have fled," said the manager who required anonymity.
He indicated that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "clair" unit had been sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commanders.
The head of Italian diplomacy Franco Frattini mentioned Belgrade, where it is located, the role played by secret agents and elements of Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result through the professionalism and effectiveness of our men of secret services, special forces," he said, without further details.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
On the previous day, the Sudanese army claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 vehicle on a patrol on which the captors were on board, killing in six, including the Chadian chief, and arresting two.
The army had claimed that they were linked to a rebel group in Darfur, the Sudan-United Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which this movement immediately denied.
Letters - The silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture is taking place and is holding this electoral campaign.
That's better.
But a sector of our cultural life is always forgotten.
Who will rise to denounce the amount of misery granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical sites that are hungry?
What politician would dare remind the federal government that he neglects his monuments and heritage buildings?
What in Quebec, like Canada, do we not have real laws that effectively preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government devote three and a half million euros to the restoration of the only castle of Chinon in the Loire Valley?
In our American neighbours, it is written in the Constitution of their country that the protection of the heritage is part of the culture of the Americans and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected and all government departments, in concert.
In Quebec, the Federation of Québec History Societies, at least 40,000 volunteers gathered in 211 societies of history, heritage, archives and genealogy are concerned about searching history, preserving with three individuals under private archives and preserving archaeological remains.
They are often the guardian dogs of our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when promoters and decision makers launch their bulldozers against our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When is a forum for history and heritage?
The Benelux governments nationalize part of the Fortis bank
The Benelux states are helping the Belgian-Dutch bank, as the first European banking institution in distress as a result of the snowball effect of the credit market crisis in the United States, partly nationalizing it. The three countries are supporting, at an amount of EUR 11.2 billion, this financial and insurance institution also having interests in Hungary.
This weekend, the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments agreed, at the highest level, on this matter, also using the European Central Bank and the European Commission's competition authority.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the international financial crisis has been widening for more than a year, is for Fortis Bank. From a certain point of view, the decisions to be taken in the case of this bank will serve as a precedent.
In accordance with the decision taken on Sunday night, the three states will purchase nearly half (49%) of the bank's capital in each of the countries.
The bank will undoubtedly sell part of its shares, including, first of all, the activities, essentially insurance, that it acquired last year from the Dutch organization ABN Amro.
Last week, Fortis actions started a dizzying fall. In the second half of the week, serious signs of crisis have already been revealed at the bank.
Analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is too large to be allowed to go bankrupt.
Only Friday, the company's shares fell by 12 percent, reaching its lowest level 14 years ago.
Since January, shares have fallen by more than two thirds of their value.
Taking into account the current value of the shares, the total value of the group's capital is around EUR 14 billion, which, according to the leaders of society, is not realistic.
The management of society accuses the uncertainty of overseas Atlantic, in relation to the adoption of the US $700 billion rescue plan, of being the cause of the fall in Fortis shares.
On Monday, paper has already received a slight increase.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed head of the bank, as the new CEO.
The financial organization was also looking for private buyers, but had not yet received a proposal on the merits.
Previously, the Belgian government announced that investors should not be concerned, they would not lose their money.
No panic was felt in the bank's clientele circle and no agency was attacked.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent agencies and has also purchased leasing companies.
A fox in the chicken
In America, life and health insurance companies frequently refuse to sign an insurance contract with a candidate on the basis of information regarding their drug purchases.
Information protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programmes that link the use of information on prescription of medicinal products, in all cases, to the consent of the person concerned.
This type of program must be in independent hands, otherwise it is to entrust its chicken to a fox" - recalled Richard Dicket, the creator of the program used to manage prescriptions for drugs in Washington Post.
Insurance companies rely on insurance premiums and insured capital in the event of damage, the client's health status, and if they feel that the risk is too great, they do not even secure it.
In the past, they sent candidates for medical examination, and they signed an insurance contract with them only after they learned of the results.
For the past ten years, Dick has found a much less expensive procedure: from an identification number, he provides easily with pharmaceuticals, data on the purchase of the person's drugs within the past eighteen months. From this, the program determines itself, what disease the person is suffering and what his or her health is.
For example, if this person regularly buys high doses of cholesterol reducer, this refers to an extremely high blood fat rate, which immediately puts it in a higher risk category.
Several versions of this program are in circulation. Some at the same time determine a risk coefficient, so there is nothing left to do to the insurer except paperwork. However, small problems may still arise.
Among the disadvantages of this program is the fact that a drug can be used for different purposes. For example, some mixtures can be used against migraine or against heat suffocates, but can also be effective against depression.
The latter is considered by insurers as an aggravating risk factor, while the others are not.
Companies have developed in the research and analysis of data, and they have to ask the patient for permission before collecting necessary information from the pharmacy.
At present, they are forced by the authorities, even though they have not been punished for their past failures.
In recent years, some companies have also treated the results of laboratory analyses, linking them with data on drug use, thus providing an even more precise picture of the patient's health status.
More and more companies have access to data, and control of use is becoming increasingly difficult at the same time.
There is a separate law on the protection of medical data, but its scope extends only to practitioners and insurers.
A proposal for a law on the extension of the supervisory circle of authorities concerning companies specialized in the provision of data is currently before the Congress.
Dick Richard recognizes that this is not sufficient and that is why he has developed further ahead of his program, which would condition the transmission of data to the exclusive agreement of the person concerned.
It is another question of whether the person concerned is really free to give his or her agreement or not, since if he or she refuses, insurance does not sign an insurance contract with him or her.
So and ultimately, the chickens depend on the kindness of the fox.
The global menu of Marseille
The European Union and India are multiplying their trade by two.
Since the European Union and India are very important trading partners for each other, this theme also dominated the agenda of this ninth summit alongside other problems, largely global.
Today, there will also be a French-India summit where cooperation on atomic energy will be the main issue.
The European Union recognizes that India is a great emerging democratic power to which a broader right of speech should be given in international affairs, but member countries have not yet been able to agree on their support for New Delhi for its candidacy as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
They were not too focused on this issue yesterday at this 9th summit in Marseille.
The French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, like the current President of the Union, as well as the President of the José Manuel Barroso Commission and the Head of Diplomacy, Javier Solana, welcomed the Indian Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed that in five years they would multiply by two trades, which means an increase of a good hundred billion euros.
Taking into account that between 2000 and 2007, the exchange of goods has increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this does not appear to be too ambitious.
In this regard, they have legally harmonized the 26 bilateral agreements with India on civil flights, and in this way air trade will also be able to expand in the future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up negotiations.
The aim is to balance the situation with India, which is the EU's first trading partner, and New Delhi, which is only in the ninth place among the EU's partners.
The summit focused its attention on global affairs.
The Afghan and Pakistani situation was strongly condemned, as well as all forms of terrorism, and the urgent need to hold a United Nations conference on this subject was raised.
The completion of the Doha trade cycle has also been requested, although both have a large share in the current failure.
The EU has confirmed that it remains faithful to the energy and climate programme, in particular that it would like to reduce by at least twenty per cent its release of toxic materials by 2020.
India also agreed on this point, as well as the need for a global market to be made at the next year's climate conference, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 per cent by 2050.
They would also like to prevent the rise in food prices, and supported the convening of an international working meeting to discuss the financial crisis.
The Indian Head of State is now going to the French capital, where at a bilateral meeting he is preparing to sign an agreement on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
In Paris, it is hoped that French companies will receive orders worth EUR 20 billion for the construction of Indian atomic reactors.
According to the press agency's information, the agreement would cover 15 years.
In Frankfurt, more than three hundred Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the International Frankfurt Book Fair.
More than three hundred Italian publishers present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting in the exchange of rights.
The International Book Fair in Frankfurt awaits this edition, more than 7 thousand exhibitors from 101 different countries that will occupy the 171,790 square metres of the exhibition with more than 403 thousand titles in exhibition, and Turkey as guest of honour.
It will be the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Property and Cultural Activities, Francesco Maria Giro, who will represent the Italian Government, at the opening ceremony of the Italian Papillon: Italy will be present institutionally, with a Point Italy - 264 square metres of exhibition space.
It will be followed by an appointment with the press in the Room Struktur, at butterfly 5.0 of the Buchmesse: an opportunity to present the figures, trends and prospects on the position of the edition in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of foreign books of authors gradually decreases from the total Italian production, and in particular from that for adults and children.
Found Steve Fossett's plane, billionaire disappeared a year ago.
The wreckage of Steve Fosset's plane, the billionaire disappeared on September 3, 2007, while flying on the Nevada desert, was found.
The debris was found on a plateau at 3000 metres above sea level, in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammonth Lakes, on the California/Nevada border.
On the inside of the plane, however, no human remains.
Madera County Sheriff John Anderson highlighted the remaining doubts: "The plane was located, we sent a team, and now we have confirmation that this is the one that Steve Fosset was travelling on the day he disappeared," he said at a press conference.
The sheriff therefore stated that no human remains were found on the plane or in the surroundings.
In February, the 63-year-old billionaire was considered deceased .
The U.S. Transportation Safety Office (Ntsb) reported that a few hours after the wreckage, a team of investigators sent to the scene, identified the aircraft: it was the Bellanca 8kcab, which disappeared on September 3, 2007, when Fosset took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fosset's personal effects were found by a couple around Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents named Fosset, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, species money and a pull.
Fossett's research was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had gained a place in history thanks to a long series of records.
At the sixth attempt, he had become in 2002, the first man to complete the world tour on an aerostatic balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later, he had gone around the world by plane and without a stop.
Of all these records, also that of having stolen 15,445 meters high, on the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect.
A 4x4 out of the common of an original and well defined design, marked lines, wide surfaces and net angles.
Here, in synthesis, Glk, the last born of the off road "compacts" of the star house, with which Mercedes-Benz tried to give a fresh wind in this area.
Just by its out-of-standard, unexpected and non-conventional content will be the communication that will accompany the launch of the 4x4 Glk, available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms, starting on 17 October next.
Thus the advertising beat that will accompany the start of the new car will give rise to an unprecedented mode of communication, through a futuristic campaign of 3D displays, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A project of maxi displays, articulated in three different phases, which will dominate the heart of the Milanese shopping, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication provides for the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision, and thanks to special glasses distributed around Corso Como, it will be possible to see the new 4x4 in almost real size and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, we will have the impression that by looking at the image, the car comes out of the poster.
Then, through the use of the innovative technology Remove8, the new Glk will be illuminated according to the spots, in all its details, and then recomposed into a single image.
It is clear that with this advertising, Mercedes tries to introduce something new into the stereotypical domain of automotive communication.
Will it succeed with this formula to stimulate the interest of future buyers? We will see.
Here are the Italian hooligans.
From the Triveneto, they risk the Daspo.
But who are these 150-200 young boys and girls whose Italy has now been ashamed of? They are part of the Ultras Italy group that has been following the Italian national team for years, and which, so far, has never created major problems.
Never had ever met the opposing typhosi.
The group's extraction is on the right.
The promoters come from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste, and Udine.
In Sofia, small groups (not really) of Campania and Puglia have been added.
They had three-coloured flags on which their city of origin appeared: Saturday evening, they were all removed to avoid being identified.
They are inspired by the English typhosserie.
In Bulgaria, they found a typhosserie of true Nazis, that of Levski.
Figc had made available Italian typhosis, 144 tickets for the party: all names, and therefore easily controlable.
And the Viminal had them all controlled: among those who left for Sofia, none had a Daspo in progress, none had been forbidden to attend a stadium.
Four Italian typhosis who had history of stadium crime, were not entitled to the ticket, and could not travel.
Now the Viminal is waiting to read the acts that will come from the Bulgarian police, and will then take action: in this case, the typhosis arrested or identified in the disorder may purge a Daspo for at least five years.
A Daspo international which prohibits attending Italian but also European stadiums.
In short, our hooligans will no longer stand at the stadium.
Gladly.
But now is the time for fear-emulation: that is, others are at risk of adding to the first one hundred and fifty.
"We must extinguish this fire immediately, and not legitimize who behaves like this," the Viminal said.
So "keep your eyes wide open especially in view of the national team match from Wednesday to Lecce"
In the Puglia there is indeed a small core of supporters of Ultras Italy.
Tomorrow, the Observatory meets on Tuesday, the Casms which can even rely on a section of the Aise, i.e. secret services, which deal precisely with stage problems.
"The Duke-Duce choirs, and the arm stretched during Mameli's anthem? In Bulgaria, it's not a crime"
Here is the opinion (expressed in a really unpleasant way) of Domenico Mazzelli, recently director of the Viminal Observatory (he took the position of Francesco Tagliente and then of Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzelli was formerly a prefect in Trieste where he lived a core of supporters of the Ultras Italy group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzelli said, that in Bulgaria renting Mussolini is not a crime, but it is certain that the behaviour of these 150-200 typhosis has been shameful.
"I am not a sociologist - added the Observatory No. 1 - crimes must be attributed in the country in which the event occurs.
Until now, this group had remained in the rules, now we will see well what happened, and we will assess for the future.
But let's also talk about whistles to Mameli's anthem: those too are not crimes, but if you will allow me, they are not police..."
