The members of the Welsh Assembly are concerned "to take them for Monicreques"
Consternation among some of the members of the Assembly, now referred to as AM in English, by the suggestion that they should change the name by MWP (Member of the Wales Parliament).
The debate arose by plans to change the name of the assembly by the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Assembly of the entire panorama fear being ridiculed.
A member of the Labour Party said that his group was concerned that the new name "is with Twp and Pwp."
For those who don't know Welsh, "twp" means "foo" and "pwp" means "caca".
A member of the Plaid Cymru party said the group's set was "not content" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh conservative said his group kept an "open mind" about the change of name, but he stressed that from MWP to Muppet there is only one small verbal leap.
In this context, the letter "w" in Welsh is pronounced in a similar manner to the English pronunciation of the letter "u" in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently drafting the legislation to introduce the name changes, said: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptor of the members of the Assembly will depend on the members themselves."
The Wales Government Law of 2017 granted the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation held on these proposals which showed much support for the name of the Welsh Parliament.
With regard to the subject of the title of AM, the commission preferred members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but MWP's option received most support in a public consultation.
It seems the AMs are suggesting alternatives, but the struggle to achieve consensus could result in a headache for the president, Elin Jones, from which you are expected to hand over the bill on changes in a few weeks.
The Reforms Act will include other changes in the functioning of the Assembly, such as the AM disabling rules and the design of the committee system.
The AM will get the final vote on what they should call when they discuss legislation.
Macedonians access polls in referendum to change the country's name
The voters will vote on Sunday if they change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote will decide to resolve a dispute that has already lasted decades with neighboring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long been insisting that its northern neighbour's name represents a complaint from its territory and has repeatedly opposed its applications for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who in the plebiscite opposes the change of name, said he will ignore the vote.
However, the advocates of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is no longer at the price that must be paid to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells remain silent while Harlem's churches continue to fight
"The elders I spoke to said that before there was a bar and a church in every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today, neither one thing nor the other."
He said he could understand the bars were gone.
"Now people socialize in other ways," he said.
"Bars are no longer the living rooms in the neighborhoods that people usually go to."
As for churches, fear that the money from the sale of assets does not last as long as the leaders expect, and "before or after they will return where they started."
He added that churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with communities full of owners of the kind of people who wouldn't help the neighborhoods remain sanctuaries.
"The vast majority of people who will buy the apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "and therefore will speed up the closure of all these churches, because it is unlikely that the new owners will become members of these churches."
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis, metropolitan community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist Congregation changed in the 1930s.
A nearby black congregation took over the building.
St. Martin was occupied by a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott to the shops of 125th Street, a commercial street in Harlem that resisted hiring and climbing black people.
A fire produced in 1939 left the building very damaged, but since Father Johnson's frigids made plans to rebuild it, they ordered the carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin, proudly named the charillon as "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played the cartoon in July called it a cultural treasure and an irreplaceable historical instrument.
The University of Michigan's Tiffany Ng expert also pointed out that it was the first carillon in the world touched by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who changed it for the largest carillon in Riverside's church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said no one occupied his place in St. Martin.
Those who have been occupying St. Martin over the past few months are a group of architects and contractors, some led by the lay leaders of the church and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The parish council, the body that rejects the parish and is composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July showing its concern that the latter "trys to impact the costs" to the assembly, although it did not participate in the recruitment of the architects and contractors who sent the diocese.
Some monks complained about the diocese's lack of transparency.
Shark wounds a boy while fishing lobsters in California
The police reported that a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while he was fishing for lobsters in California on the first day of that crustacean season.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel narrated to the KSWB-TV in San Diego who had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy asking for help in shouting, when he swam with a group of people to help get him out of the water.
Hammel said at first he thought it was only excitement to catch a lobster, but he soon realized that he was shouting "I was worked!
They've worked on me!'
Hammel said he realized when he came to the boy.
'I'll call everyone out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'' added Hammel.
The boy was transferred by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he's in critical condition.
The type of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, said in a press conference that they had divided a shark in the area a few weeks ago, but they had determined that it wasn't a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic damage at the top of the torso.
The officers closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach, in Casablad, to Swami's, in Ecinitas, for 48 hours to undertake an investigation and also for security reasons.
Giles observed that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty runners similar to those of the big warehouses full of specialist assistants.
As part of the considerable immersion in the UK beauty market, which amounts to 2,800 million pounds and continues to grow as fashion sales and household products fall, the largest corridors with beauty products will be tested in 11 tents across the country, and then they will pass to others next year if they succeed.
The investment in beauty is produced at a time when supermarkets seek to fill the shelves that in their day occupied televisions, microwaves and home products.
Sainsbury's stated that he would double his offer of beauty products to the point of achieving 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Current L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees collections will also get more space with exclusive areas similar to those seen in tents like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its range of Boutique makeup so that most products are suitable for vegans, something increasingly demanded by the newest customerele.
In addition, the perfume store, The Fragrance Shop, will prove concessions in two Sainsbury's establishments; the first opened in Croydon in southern London last week, while the second opens in Selly Oak, Birmingham, this year.
Online shopping and a change that translates into buying small amounts of food daily in small shops implies that supermarkets have to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, executive president of Sainsbury's, said that the establishments will increasingly look like shopping malls, as supermarket chains are trying to compete with discount stores like Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's already introduced Argos and Habitat's sales points in hundreds of stores, since it bought the two chains two years ago.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to modernize its departments of pharmacy and beauty was a failure.
Sainsbury's launched an initiative with Boots in the early 2000s, but association came to an end after a dispute over how to share drugstore revenues in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sells its pharmacy business formed by 281 stores to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, 125 million pounds three years ago.
It was noted that Lloyds would participate in the plan by adding a wide range of luxury cosmetic brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in 4 tents.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We transformed the image of our beauty corridors to improve the surroundings for our customers.
We also invest in specially trained personnel that you can turn to for advice.
Our range of products is designed to suit all needs and attractive and practical locations mean that we are now a cosmetic destination that challenges old shopping habits."
Peter Jones "angry" after Holly Willoughby withdraws from business of 11 million pounds
The star of the Dragons Den program, Peter Jones, left "angry" after Holly Willoughby had retired from a 11 million-pound business with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for his brand of home clothes and Truly accessories.
His company had been compared to Goop, Gwyneth Paltew's brand.
The 37-year-old presenter of This Morning used Instagram to announce her farewell.
Holly Willoughby left the star of Dragons' Den, Peter Jones throwing sparks at him when he retired from his lifestyle brand in the last minute to focus on his new gold contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources indicate that Jones was "angry" when the golden girl on television admitted during a tense meeting held on Saturday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that his new business, valued at 1.5 million pounds, meant that he had no time to devote to the brand of home clothes and accessories of both, Truly.
The business came to compare with Goop, Gwyneth Paltrow's brand, and it was predicted that it would double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, turned to Instagram to announce he was leaving Truly, Jones took a plane to Britain and headed for one of his vacation residences.
One source said, "Truly was unlike one of Holly's priorities.
It was going to be your long-term future for the next two decades.
His decision to leave surprised everyone who participated in the project.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There was a warehouse full of goods in the offices of Marlow ready to sell."
Experts believe that the abandonment of the presenter of This Morning is among the most profitable stars in Britain could cost the company millions of pounds, due to the considerable investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothes and textiles for home, and which could further delay their launch.
And it could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin are parents of three children and have a close friendship with Jones and his wife, Tara, for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, aged 52, joined as president in March.
Couples went on vacation together and Jones had a 40% share in Baldwin's television producer.
Willoughby will become the ambassador of the M&S brand and replace Ant McPartlin as a presenter on the ITV I'm a Celebrity program.
A source near Jones declared last night that "We shouldn't comment on your business."
A complicated conversation "and then we fell in love"
He played with the criticisms he would receive from the media for making a comment that some would consider "unfit by a president" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give in so much?
Trump said by putting his voice on "telexor presenter."
"I didn't give in."
He pointed out that Kim was interested in holding a second meeting after his initial meeting held in June in Singapore, which Trump considered a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But the negotiations for denuclearization have stalled.
More than three pesos after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean chief diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday, that the North does not see the "corresponding response" on the part of the United States to the first disarmament measures in North Korea.
On the contrary, he pointed out, the United States continues to impose sanctions aimed at further exerting pressure.
Trump adopted a much more optimistic view in his rally speech.
"Things with North Korea go well," he said.
"We're going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have this excellent relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had positive results: ending missile tests, helping free the hostages and getting the rest of the U.S. soldiers back home.
And he defended his unusual strategy by talking about relations with Kim.
"It's very easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this amphitheater, we'd have about 200 people standing here," said Trump pointing out to the crowd he had right in front of.
A earthquake and tsunami devastating an island in Indonesia leaving hundreds of deaths
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that they didn't need them.
Although more than 10 percent of the Lombok population has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, which is an essential condition for catalyzing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they will not ask for international help, so it is a challenge," Mrs. Subung said.
While Save the Children is gathering a team to travel to Palu, it's still unclear whether foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster management agency, has assured that Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies can contribute with their help.
Given the earthquakes that constantly endure Indonesia, the country is extremely ill-prepared to face the anger of nature.
Although there were tsunami shelters in Aceh, it's not usual to find them on the other side.
Even if an alert was issued, the absence of a tsunami alert siren in Palu probably contributed to the loss of lives.
At best, travelling among many of Indonesia's islands presents a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that had been deployed in Lombok to attend to the earthquake victims is heading for Palu, but it will take at least three days for the place of the new calamity.
President Joko Widodo's election campaign revolved around the improvement of Indonesia's deteriorating infrastructure, and donated money on roads and railways.
But Mr. Joko's administration is affected by a great lack of funds in the final line to re-election next year.
Mr. Joko is also affected by continued sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a way of living the most conservative faith.
More than 1,000 people were murdered and tens of thousands were forced to leave their homes because of the clashes in the streets of Christian and Muslim bands, which use machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
View: The Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scores the goal of the draw in front of Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat in the Premier League in front of Chelsea with a goal at the 89th on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while still about 27 meters from Chelsea's gate with his team losing 1-0.
He played the ball with his left leg before firing a shot at the second pole.
The ball flew over the area as it advanced towards the top left corner of the network.
The ball ended up falling over a Kepa Arrizabalaga that was jumping into the air and entering the net.
"I was just trying to get to that position, to organize ourselves, and players like Shaq always play the ball forward as much as possible, so I tried to earn as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I came to Kante and said a touch without thinking too much and I just shot."
Chelsea won 1-0 in the break after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The front of the Blues passed the heel ball to Mateo Kovacic in that game, before turning near the middle change and running into the Liverpool field..
Kovacic made a wall in the center of the countryside.
He made a beautiful passage in depth leading Hazard towards the area.
Hazard overcame the defense and ended up in the second pole with a sharp shot at the south that Alisson Becker couldn't stop.
Liverpool faces Naples at the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at St. Paul's Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will do the same with Videoton at UEFA Europe League Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The number of fatal victims of the Indonesian tsunami rises to 832
The number of deaths in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, as reported on Sunday morning the national disaster management agency.
Many people would be trapped in the rubble of the buildings that came down with the 7.5 magnitude earthquake on Friday and which caused waves of up to 6 meters, as indicated in a press conference the spokesman for the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho agency.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is covered with rubble from the collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman had been stabbed to death.
A murder investigation opened after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with white gun wounds on John Street, and arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of murder.
The police asked people in the area to see or hear something from that step forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: 'The investigation is at its initial stage, but I'd like to make a call to contact us any who had been near John Street in Birkenhead who had seen or heard anything suspicious.
I'd also like to ask anyone, especially the cab drivers, to capture anything with the camera in the order box that comes in contact with us, as they might have key information for our investigation'.
A police spokesman confirmed that the body found belongs to a neighbor of Birkenhead and found itself inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who thought they knew the woman came to the scene to answer questions about where she found herself that morning.
The investigation continues while the police say they're in the process of informing the closest relatives of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police have informed him that they can't let anyone in or out of the building.
The man ran out of words when he found out what happened.
Residents just know they won't be able to come back in a few hours.
A police officer was heard to tell a man that the area is considered a crime scene.
There's a woman crying on the scene.
No stop saying 'it's awful'.
At 2 p.m. there were two police vans inside the cordon with another van just outside.
Several officers remain inside the cordon watching the block of apartments.
Anyone who has information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, who calls 101 or who anonymously contacts Crimestoppers in the phone number 0800 555 111, citing the September 30, 247 record.
The statue of Cromwell of parliament becomes the last monument affected by the struggle for "rewriting history"
His prohibition would be poetic justice for his Taliban destruction of so many religious and cultural objects from England carried out by his fanatical and Puritan followers.
But Cromwell Society qualified Mr. Crick's suggestion to "shoot" and "try to rewrite the story."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate about the withdrawal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell located outside the Palace of Westminster became a target.
The iconoclasty of English civil wars was neither ordered nor performed by Cromwell.
Perhaps they would have sacrificed the wrong Cromwell for the actions of his predecessor Thomas the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is evidence of the opinion that existed in the 19th century, and part of the historiography of a figure that many consider to be still worthy of honor.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than now, as a parliamentary defender of external pressure, in this case, of course, it was the monarchy.
Whether that is a complete representation or not is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
What's clear is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has defined the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure that represents one side of the division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration."
A killer pig smashes a Chinese farmer
According to local media, a pig attacked and murdered a farmer in a southwest China market.
Last Sunday the South China Morning Post reported that the man, identified only by the name, "Yuan," was found dead with a blood-stricken artery near a cortex in the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province.
A pig breeder prepares to put the vaccines to pigs in a stable on May 30th, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
Apparently he had traveled with his cousin on Wednesday from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door that gave another adjacent courtyard.
He said there was a big male with blood in his mouth.
The forensic analysis confirmed that the pig, nearly 250 kilos, attacked the farmer until he was killed.
"My cousin had his legs bled and crushed," declared the cousin, "Wu," to Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera recording shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent him from attacking anyone else while the police gathered evidence on the scene.
It seems that Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for their death.
Although they're not very common, there's already been cases of pigs attacking humans before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on the farm that the couple had in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a pig nearly 300 kilos seized a Welsh farmer against the tractor until his wife arrived and frightened the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon had been devoured by his own pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs don't usually be aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as "gunner."
"They're just playing.
They're like children, very curious... they don't intend to hurt.
You just have to have the respect you need," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring strong and generalized rains to the southwest of the United States.
The forecasts indicate that Hurricane Rosa weakens as it overtakes the cold waters of the north coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will take torrential rains north of Mexico and southwest of the United States for the next few days.
At 5:00 a.m., east time, Rosa was a 1st-class hurricane with winds of more than 135 km/h and was about 620 km from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a valley begins to take shape over the Pacific Ocean and to move east, towards the east coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the peninsula of Lower California on Monday as a tropical storm, she will begin to push tropical humidity northward, which will penetrate the southwestern United States.
Rosa will bring more than 250 l/m2 of rain to some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Next, the interaction of tropical humidity with the valley will create abundant and generalized rains in the southwest in the coming days.
At the local level, rainfall between 25 and 100 l/m2 will cause dangerous floods, debris flows and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
Great tropical humidity will cause precipitation that will reach 50 or 75 l/m2 in spot areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In parts of the southwest it is expected from 50 to 100 l/m2 of rain, especially on much of Arizona.
The possibility of sudden flooding with deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
We strongly discourage venture in the desert under threat of tropical rain.
The heavy rains could form cannons that could become floating rivers, and the electric storms will bring locally broken winds and dust.
The valley will bring locally strong rains to parts of the southern coast of California.
Total rainfall could reach more than 12 l/m2, which in turn could cause smaller debris flow and slippery roads.
These would be the first rains in the wet season in the region.
Tropical rains scattered will begin approaching Arizona in the last hours of Sunday and early Monday, before the rain spreads at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
Abundant rain will arrive at Four Corners on Tuesday, which will last until Wednesday.
October will witness great fluctuations of temperature in the United States due to the cooling of the Arctic, although the tropics will remain quite warm.
This sometimes implies important temperature changes in short distances.
On Sunday we can see a great example of drastic temperature differences in the center of the United States.
There will be a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
During the next few days, the persistent summer heat will try to reappear and expand again.
For the central and eastern part of the country is expected a warm beginning of October, with temperatures that will exceed 26 degrees from the southern plains to the northeast.
New York could reach 26 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 12 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high probability of temperatures above average to the east of the country during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people saw the trial in Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people followed on six television channels the passionate witnesses of the judge appointed to Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political stagnation continues and the prisons interrupt their usual programming for a new Friday-late hour: an agreement designed by the senator by Arizona, Jeff Flake, for the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation of charges.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee that he's 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh has played to him when he's drunk and tried to take his clothes out at a school party.
In a passionate witness, Kavanaugh said he was absolutely sure that had not happened.
Nielsen reported on Friday that more than 20.4 million people would have seen him.
The company counted the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other channels that broadcast it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble measuring people watching television from offices.
To get an idea, it's a hearing similar to an end of football or the Oscar ceremony.
Fox News Channel, who greatly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, led all the chains with an average of 5.69 million spectators during a trial that lasted all day, according to Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94, MSNBC 2.89 and CNN 2.52 million according to Nielsen.
After the trial interest persisted.
Flake was the central figure on Friday on television.
After the moderate Republican's office made a statement indicating that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, he was captured by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning by protesters when he tried to enter an elevator on his way to the hearing of the Judicial Committee.
He remained with his eyes low for several minutes while being repressed, live television at CNN.
"I'm here before you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
They said, "You have power while there are many defenseless women."
Flake said that his office made a Flake statement, before the elevator was closed, he added that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
All television and cable channels broadcast live hours later when the Judicial Committee had to vote to advance the appointment of Kavanaugh before the whole Senate to vote.
But Flake said he would only do that if the FBI investigated the allegations against the nominated next week, something that urged a minority of Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced of the conversations he had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a subsequent discussion with Coons and several senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's election had power, because it was obvious that Republicans wouldn't have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened an investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accuses critics of playing politics with Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticized her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain's future and harming national interest.
Prime Minister Theresa May arriving at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with him on the front page of the paper, his former foreign minister Boris Johnson insisted on attacking the so-called May Chequers plan for Brexit saying that the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect the tariffs on the other side was "totally absurd".
Wayde Sims Murdered: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson as Suspected of LSU Player's Death · Global Voices
Police arrested a suspect of shooting that ended up in the life of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU (Louisian State University).
According to Baton Rouge police department, 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and imprisoned for a second-degree murder.
The officers issued the video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said that Sims had lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered the glasses from the scene and said they contained Simpson's DNA, according to CBS' affiliate channel WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, the police said they admitted to being the author of the shooting that killed Wayde.
The defense reported that he had been charged with US$350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Forensics Office issued a preliminary report on Friday indicating that the cause of death is a bullet wound in the head that came to the neck.
The department commended the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Unit, the State Police Criminalization Laboratory, the Southern University police are to the neighbours for their help in getting the arrest.
LSU's sports director, Joe Alleva, thanked the forces of the local order for his "diligence and pursuit of justice."
Sims was 20.
The 2.01 ship grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
His average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "buried" and "buried" by Wayde's death.
"That's what concerns us all the time," Wade declared.
Grey volcano on Mexico City
The ashes that the Popocatepetl volcano throws came to the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre advised Mexicans on Saturday to move away from the volcano after they detected activity in the crater and registered 183 gas and ash emissions within 24 hours.
The center was monitoring several shocks and tremors.
Social media images showed fine layers of ash in the windshields of Mexico City neighborhoods like Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have detected an increase in the activity of the volcano located 72 kilometers south of the capital since an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 had rocked the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Face between the police and Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters faced the riot police and while thousands of people joined the rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizing vote on Catalonia's secession.
A group of masked proseparatists contained by the anti-disturbing police threw eggs and powdered paint that created dark dust clouds in the streets that tend to be crowded with tourists.
There were also frescoes later that same day with the police, who used the balls to contain the fight.
For several hours, pro-independentist groups that coreed "Never forgotten or forgiven", faced unionist protesters who shouted "Long life to Spain".
Fourteen people had to be treated for minor injuries received in the protest, according to the local press.
The tension continues to flower of skin in the independent region a year after the referendum of October 1st, held by Catalan separatists, although considered illegal by Madrid.
The voters opted for independence, although participation was low and the opposite of secession boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police had tried to stop the vote at election tables throughout the region in violent confrontations.
The pro-independent groups camped all Friday night to avoid a demonstration of support for the national police.
The demonstration also took place, but they were forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who went to the independent demonstration with his wife, said he had no hope of Catalonia getting independence.
"Last year we lived one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry for joy at voting, but now we're stuck," he remarked.
Despite obtaining an adjusted, albeit decisive victory, in the regional elections of last December, this year the pro-independent Catalan parties fought for maintaining momentum, with many of their most known leaders in self-imposed exile or detained pending trial for their participation in the referendum organization and subsequent declaration of independence
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the demonstration in support of the police with his mobile phone, said that the conflict had been fuelled by politicians on both sides.
"There's more tension every time," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since last year, announced that the following year he would present himself to the elections to the European Parliament.
"Presenting me as a candidate for European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression we have suffered from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: They arrest a man after a car hits a house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car had been arrested on several occasions against a Londonderry house.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19:30 (Summer Time in Britain).
Police investigation inspector Bob Blemmings declared the fence and the building itself were the damaged parts.
It's also possible that a beast could be fired at the car at some point.
Menga's goal gives Livingston 1-0 victory over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ended in victory
Ascended Livingston surprised Rangers by leading Steven Gerrard to his second defeat in 18 matches as a trainer for the club of Iberox.
Dolly Menga's goal was decisive for Gary Holt's team to rise to a level by placing itself after Hibernian in second place.
Gerard's team is still out of the house this year at Premiership and next Sunday they face the leader, Hearts, from which they separate eight points.
But first the Rangers will receive the Rapid Vienna in Europe League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston remains invincible in the sixth consecutive party division; the main trainer, Holt, has not yet known defeat since he replaced Kenny Mile with me.
Livingston allows opportunities to escape from weakened visitors
Holt's team must have moved ahead long before they scored, since with their control they caused all sorts of trouble to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson opened his way but his crossfire did not cross the door threshold; then Alan Lithgow's shot came out driven by a head of Craig Halkett from the other side of the door.
The host team was content to let Rangers play in front of them, aware that they could put visitors at risk in the standing ballgames.
And that's how the decisive goal came about.
Rangers gave a free shot and Livingston carried out a sack in which Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined their efforts to fix the Menga, which played the ball and scored from the center of the area.
At that time Rangers dominated the possession but found himself in an impenetrable defense that avoided a lot of work for the Liam Kelly ranger.
That pattern went on in the second half, though Alfredo Morelos forced a Kelly stop.
The Rangers' watchman, Allan McGregor held heavy a shot of Scott Pittman, and Lithgow threw the ball out in another shot at Livingston's standing ball.
There were many cross-passes in the Livingston area that were continuously cleared, while two criminal requests were rejected: one by one hand and one by one entry from Halkett to the Glenn Middleton substitute.
Livingston's phenomenal: analysis
Alasdair Lamont for BBC Scotland from stadium Tony Macaroni
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
It's unanimous, they've been excellent and continue to overcome expectations in their ascending path.
His game style and players have only changed since he returned to the top category, but part of the merit is Holt's by the way he pushed the team since his arrival.
I had lots of heroes.
Halkett, the captain, led superbly a perfectly organized defense while Menga didn't give them a breath all over the game to Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall.
Rangers lack inspiration.
Despite working well on occasions under Gerard's orders, on this occasion they didn't reach that level.
They failed the last pass, they only managed to penetrate the host team once, a whole call for attention to Rangers, which is in the middle of the table.
Erdogan receives an ambiguous welcome in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, there were smiles and blue skies during the meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany to lunch in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to resolve the relationship between NATO allies.
They disagreed on many issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's access to the EU.
Then Erdogan headed to Cologne to inaugurate a giant new mosque.
The city brings together the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police claimed security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from meeting in front of the mosque, but many Erdogan supporters approached to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan (many of them Kurds) also raised their voices condemning both Erdogan's policies and the decision of the German government to receive them in the country.
The duel of demonstrations reflects the division before a visitor hailed as a hero by some German Turks and criticized as an autocrat by others.
Traffic accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies when colliding with a car
A cyclist died in a collision where a car was surrounded in London.
The accident took place near the intersection between the Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a street transiting from Deptford, south-east of the city, about 10:15 a.m. (Summer Time in Britain).
The driver of the car stopped and the paramedics arrived, but the man died in the act.
The accident takes place months after another cyclist dies in a runaway crash at Childers Street a little over a mile from the Saturday accident.
The metropolitan police said the officers were working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
There are street fences and buses have been diverted and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers are injured in riots
Six prison officers were injured in an altercation in the high-security prison, according to the prison officer.
The riot began at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m. (Summer Time in Britain) on Sunday and still continues.
A "Tornado" unit of specialized officers came to deal with riots, involving eight inmates who are contained in a pavilion.
The officers received attention for slight injuries to the face.
A prison servant spokesperson said: "It has been deployed from specially trained prisons to face a continuing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members had to be treated for injuries.
We don't tolerate violence in our prisons and we're clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and could spend more time between bars."
HMP Long Lartin houses more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was known that the director of the penitentiary had to be hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October of last year, riot officers had to go to jail to calm down a riot in which the staff was attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (the places affected by the drought could benefit)
It's rare that a tropical depression affects Arizona, but it's very likely to happen early next week, when the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa passes through the Southwest Desert leaving the possibility of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued sudden flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday from Western Arizona to the south and east from Nevada, south-east California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to pass directly over Phoenix on Tuesday and arrive at the last hour of Monday with rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service has indicated in a Twitter post that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained the state of depression or tropical storm on a 320-kilometre Phoenix radio since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was a hurricane extending over a radius of 64 kilometers from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Weather Service provide 50 to 10 l/m2 of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 150l/m2 on the Arizona Mogollón Edge.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert, such as the Central Rockies and the Gran Conca could reach up to 25 or 50 litres, with total isolated areas of 100 l/m2 being possible.
For those who are safe from sudden flooding, Rosa's rain could be a blessing, since the region is very affected by the droughts.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some of this rain may be beneficial, as the Southwest is experiencing droughts.
According to the U.S. Dry Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme dryness, the second largest category," saidweather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will land on the Lower California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, who still has hurricane strength on Sunday morning, with a wind of up to 136 km/h, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is heading north to 19 km/h.
The storm is facing cold water in the Pacific and hence, losing strength.
For this reason it is expected that it will touch the land in Mexico with force of tropical storm in the afternoon or the evening of Monday.
It could rain very intensively in some parts of Mexico, assuming an important risk of flooding.
"Total rainfall is expected between 75 and 150 l/m2 from Baja California to northwest Sonora, and it is possible to meet up to 250 l/m2," reportsweather.com.
Then Rosa will head north across Mexico in the form of a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border the first hour of Tuesday as a tropical depression and then continue to climb through Arizona and enter south of Utah the last hour of Tuesday night.
"The main danger of Rosa or what's left of her is the heavy rainfall in Baja California, in the northwest of Sonora and in the Southwest Desert of the United States," said the National Center of Hurricanes.
These rains are expected to cause sudden water trumpets and debris flows in the deserts, and landslides in mountainous lands.
Midsomer Norton Assault: Four Arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested under suspicion of attempted murder and found a 16-year-old boy with white gunshot wounds.
The teenager was found injured in the area of Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton, Saturday around 4:00 (Summer Time in Britain).
He was taken to the hospital, where he remains "stable".
According to Somerset police, three boys aged 17, 18 and 20 respectively were arrested at Radstock during the night.
The officers asked for the collaboration of anyone who had a recording on the cell phone of the incident.
Trump claims that Kavanaugh ‘suffered the misery and anger’ of the Democratic Party
"Vote by Judge Kavanaugh is voting to reject the ruthless and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," said Trump at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump declared that Kavanaugh "suffered the misery and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout its appointment process.
Kavanaugh testified to Congress on Thursday, where he categorically and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that she had sexually assaulted her decades ago, being teenagers.
Ford also testified at the trial about his accusation.
The president said on Saturday that the "Americans" were witnesses of Kavanaugh's brilliance, quality and courage.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the best lawyers of our time with a history of impolite public service," he said addressing the crowd of admirers of West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's appointment as he spoke of the importance of Republican results in half-term elections.
"It takes five weeks for one of the most important elections of our lives.
I don't do it, but I really do," he said.
"That's why I go everywhere fighting for great candidates."
Trump argued that the mission of the Democrats is to "oppose and hinder."
It's expected that the first procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's appointment will take place before Friday, according to CNN, an assistant to the Republican Party.
Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami causes hundreds of deaths and the number continues to grow
The authorities reported on Saturday that at least 384 people died, many of them dragged by giant waves that broke into the beaches, when a great earthquake and tsunami affected the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday to attend a festival on the beach in the village of Palu when waves of up to six meters broke into the earth in the luscofusque, leading the lives of many and destroying everything in their footsteps.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
" Yesterday, when the threat arose, people were still with their activities on the beach and did not flee immediately, so they died," declared Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia BNPB's disaster mitigation agency in a round of hurry in Iacarta.
"The tsunami didn't just come, dragged cars, trunks, house, dragged everything he found," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled high seas at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
Some people went up to the trees to escape the tsunami and managed to survive, he said.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photographs broadcast by the national agency for disaster management showed many tents and destroyed buildings, twisted and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The replicas continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes felt in an area with 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) declared that the energy released by the huge earthquake on Friday was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb launched on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, seated at the end of a long, narrow bay, was able to magnify the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "quantious" and said that thousands of homes, malls and hotels had come down.
The bodies of some victims found themselves trapped under the rubble of fallen buildings, declared, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho announced that the victims and the damage could be greater along the north coast of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications were "totally paralyzed and there's no information" from Donggala, added Nugroho.
There are over 300,000 people living there," reported the Red Cross in a communiqué, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse," he said.
The agency was severely criticized on Saturday for not reporting the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived at the time the warning was issued.
In a recording of a social media fan, you can hear a man on the last floor of a building shouting frantically warning people on the arrival of a tsunami in the street.
In a matter of minutes the water strikes against the tanning leading forward buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately certify the authenticity of the recording.
The earthquake and the tsunami caused a major blackout that caused the cut-off of communications throughout Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue tasks.
The authorities claim that the army has already started sending cargo aircraft from Iacarta and other cities, but the evacuees continue to urgently need food and other basic needs.
The city airport was reopened but only for relief work and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo plans to visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The balance of victims of the Indonesian tsunami exceeds the figure of 800.
It's terrible.
On the way through World Vision staff to get to Palu, where the employees shelter themselves in canvas shelters raised in the courtyard of their office, they contemplated scenes of total devastation, commented Mr. Dosebah.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed," he said.
It's terrible.
Even when the groups began the unpleasant task of continuing assistance in the event of a disaster, some complained that they were preventing Palu from travelling to foreign humanitarian workers with great knowledge and experience.
According to Indonesian legislation, funds, supplies and staffing from foreign sources can only flow if the place of calamity is declared a national catastrophic zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the level of a province," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says, "All right, this is a national disaster," we can open ourselves to international aid, but it's not yet that time."
By falling the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday, family and friends of the missing people were clinging to the hope that their loved ones were one of the miracles that eased the depressing argument of natural disasters."
On Saturday they pulled a child out of a sink.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been under the rubble for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, trainer of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended early this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandagi added that some of the people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel were his students.
"As a person with extensive experience in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon told how, in the hours following the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel among the paragliding community, he desperately tried to send messages from WhatsApp to the competitors of Palu, who were participating in the beach festival
However, only one gray mark was shown in the messages instead of two blue marks.
"I think that means the messages haven't been delivered," he added.
They steal $26,750 while reloading a cashier in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, some thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink worker who was charging a cashier in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport police department.
In the press release, investigator officer Dennis McCarthy wrote that the driver of the car had emptied a cashier in the leisure complex and prepared to deliver more money.
While he was busy, another man "has come running from behind Brink's employee" and stole from him a bag of money he had to deliver.
According to the note, witnesses saw several suspects abandoned the stage, but the police did not specify how many were involved in the incident.
If you have any information about your identities, contact the Newport police by calling 859-292-3680.
Kid Kanye West renames Ye
Kid Kanye West changes his name for Ye.
To announce the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The being formerly known as Kanye West."
For some time now West, 41, is known to Ye's nickname, which used as the title of his eighth album, published in June.
The change took place before his appearance at Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new Yandhi album.
He will replace singer Ariana Grande in the program, who cancelled his attendance by "emotional reasons," according to the creator of the program.
Besides being an abbreviation for his current professional name, West had already explained that the word had a religious meaning to him.
"I think 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'ti'," said that same year West as he was talking about his record with the radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you, it's us, it's us.
I went from Kanye, which means the only one, to Ye alone, which is a reflection of the goodness that exists in us, of wickedness, of confusion, of everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
Kanye is another of the famous foxes who changed their names.
Sean Combs was formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, although this year he announced he prefers to be called Love and Brother Love.
An old West collaborator, JAY-Z, also picked up and removed the script and using the capital letters.
AMLO pledges not to use military against civilians
Mexico's elected president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has pledged not to use military force against civilians when the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against the students comes.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that "he would no longer use the military to suppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the troops shot at a peaceful demonstration in the square killing about 300 people at a time when student movements were taking root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support Mexican youth by giving monthly help to boys studying and opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities drag boys to criminal gangs.
U.S. should double the investment in I.A.
According to AI Kai-Fu Lee's professional investor, who's employed by Google, Microsoft and Apple, the United States should double the amount he invests in AI in view of China's growing activity in the field.
Comments were made after several parts of the U.S. government made announcements about AI, even though the U.S. lack a formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan the previous year: it intends to be number 1 in AI innovation in 2030.
"Dualizing the research budget in AI would be a good start, since the other countries are much behind the US, and we're looking for the next great advance in AI," said Lee.
Doubling funding could double the likelihood that the next AI achievement would be done in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is Director General of Innovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most prominent Chinese AI companies: Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that won the American Othello player with the highest score and later was executive at Microsoft Research of the Google subsidiary in China.
Lee recognized old U.S. government technology contests as the Robotic Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency and asked when it would be the next one to help identify the next visionaries.
In the U.S., researchers usually have to work a lot to get government scholarships, Lee says.
"China is not taking academic leaders, but companies," he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired university geniuses to work in AI.
Lee pointed out that changing immigration policy could also help the United States boost its efforts in AI.
"I think they should offer residence cards to the doctors in AI," he said.
The China State Council published its New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences in China offers funding to people from academic institutions just as the National Foundation for Science and other government organizations distribute money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established an artificial intelligence centre which is designed to include industry and university partners, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Information.
And this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2,000 million in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, you currently invest over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislation that has been seeking to create a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has not been moving for months.
The Macedonians vote in referendum if they change the country's name.
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday in a referendum if they wanted to change their name to the "Northern Republic of Macedonia", a movement that would resolve a dispute with Greece for decades and block applications for admission to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the names of its northern neighbours represent a claim from its territory and has banned its entry into NATO and the EU.
The governments of both countries came to an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change would prejudice the ethnic identity of most of the Slavic population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he won't vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether the result will reach the minimum 50 per cent necessary for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum paper was: "Are you in favour of accession to NATO and the EU with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Advocates of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is a price worth paying to be admitted to entities such as the EU or NATO of Macedonia, one of the emerging countries of the fall of Yugoslavia.
"Today I came to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although it's not legally binding, many members of parliament said they would heed the result of the vote and make it definitive.
The change of nine would need a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission stated that at 1 p.m. there had been no irregularity.
However, participation was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent of the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children, our site is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old capital voter, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted for the Macedonian referendum on the change of the country's name that would pave the way for his accession to the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavvarkov set up a small stage and placed chairs in front of the tents for those who boycotted the referendum.
"We're in favour of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to do it with our heads high and not through the service door," added Cavavarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't accept us as Macedonia, we can go to other countries like China and Russia and join the Eurasian Union."
Prime Minister Zaev claims that accession to NATO will bring the much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
"I think the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of EU and NATO entry," Zaev said after he voted.
He said a positive result would be the "confirmation of our future."
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research revealed that between 30 and 43 percent of the voters would participate in the referendum, which is below the demand.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian television channel Telma indicated that 57 percent of the people consulted planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said I'd vote.
For the referendum to be valid, the result must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure in the referendum would represent the first major blow to pro-Western government policy since it had access to power in May of the past.
See: Sergio Agüero, player in Manchester City, goes through all of Brighton's defense and ends up marking a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling reported on Brighton's defense with 2-0 from Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguaro made it look ridiculously easy to score the 65 minute goal.
The Argentine front received a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between three Brighton's defenses before heading into the open field.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four green T-shirts.
He disbanded himself from a defense before overcoming several others on the edge of the Brighton area.
Next, he passed the ball to his left and found Sterling.
The English forwarder used the first touch of the area to return the ball to Aguaro, which hit the Brighton Mathew Ryan's locker with a shot to the right of the net.
"Awater is going through some problems on the foot," said the City's trainer, Pep Guardiola, to the reporters.
"We're talking about playing 55 or 60 minutes.
And that's when it happened.
We were lucky to have you dialed at that time."
But it was Sterling who gave the blues the initial advantage in confronting the Premier League.
That goal arrived in the 29th minute.
Aguro received the ball in the depth of Brighton's field at that game.
He sent a beautiful pass through the gap on the right side towards Leroy Sane.
Sane gave several touches before driving Sterling to the opposite post.
The blues put the ball in the front door before they left the camp.
The City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to water the Rockies
With the Nationals out of the fight for elimination, there were not many reasons to force another title.
But a always competitive Scherzer expects to launch Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still implications for the Rockies, that bring an advantage party to Los Angeles Dodgers in the Division west of the National League.
The Rockies secured at least one wildling position with 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but they're still trying to close their first division title.
"Even if we don't play anything, at least we can touch the rubber knowing that the atmosphere in Denver with the crowd and the other team would probably play at the highest level I played this year.
Why won't I want to compete with that?"
The Nationals have not yet announced who will be the opening party on Sunday, but they seem to be inclined to Scherzer to be the one who throws into such a situation.
Scherzer, for whom it would be his start number 34, did another bullpen session on Thursday and will probably launch Sunday on his usual day of rest.
Washington's right is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 tickets this season.
Trump celebrates a rally in West Virginia
The president referred indirectly to the situation surrounding the election for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while discussing the importance of the result in elections of half term.
"We played everything we did in November.
It's five weeks away for one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is something great, great... I don't have a job, but I really do and that's why I go all over the world fighting for great candidates," he said.
Trump went on to say, "You've seen this horrible radical group of Democrats, look what's happening now.
And they're determined to regain power by any means necessary, wickedness, and wickedness.
They don't care who hurt, over who has to go through to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, and we're never going to give it to them."
The mission of the Democrats is to oppose and hinder."
"And you've seen that for the past four days," he said, qualifying Democrats for "annoyed, valved, disgusting and lying."
He listed the Senate Judicial Committee citing Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, who received strong public apospos.
"Remember your answer?
Filtered the document?
Mmm..e. what?
No, mmm, no, wait... it was the worst body language, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer so open.
He is not tolerant of those who express his opinion
When Momentum activists from my local party voted to censure me, the truth is, I wasn't too surprised.
After all, I'm the last of a series of Labour MPs that we're not well received, and all by saying our opinion.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because he faced decisive anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn
on the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security and on Europe, occasionally issues that Jeremy was discussing with previous leaders.
Nottingham East's work meeting notification on Friday indicated that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of the eight years I have been a Labour Member, the committee's Friday night meetings were exactly like this.
Unfortunately, that's no longer the tone of many meetings, and the promise of a "kinder and gentler" policy has long forgotten, if it ever began.
It's becoming increasingly evident that the Labour Party doesn't tolerate different opinions and it's judged whether all opinions are acceptable to the party leader.
This began shortly after Jeremy became party leader, when fellows who believed to share a similar political vision began to expect me to portray and adopt positions with which I would never agree, both in terms of national security and in the EU's single market.
When I speak publicly, and actually somewhat the same as I say, there's a tremendous uproar and attacks on social networks censoring downtown politics, telling me I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just me.
In fact, I know that I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments addressed to me are usually political in nature.
I'm impressed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a stream of sexist or racist comments every day and who don't give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the levels of insults were normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party had to promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we're no longer so open and that with every movement of "untrustworthy" or every change in the rules of selection, the party becomes narrower by looking.
Over the past few years, I've received a lot of advice that I'm trying to keep my head down, unless it's so frank and then "all would be fine for me."
But I didn't get involved in politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party in 32 years since I was still in school, driven by the negligence of Thatcher's government that literally dropped out of my class, I have tried to demand better public services for those who need them most, both local concierge and government minister.
I've never hidden my politics, not even in the last election.
No member of Nottingham East could be confused about my political positions and I disagree with the party's current leadership.
To those who promoted the Friday motion, all I'd say is that as the country walks towards a Brexit that will affect our homes, businesses and public services, I don't understand that desire to waste time and energy questioning my loyalty to the party leader.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: An Invict Ayr Is Headed
The last two attempts may have changed the final outcome a little, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this sweet enjoyment of the Tenent Premier League.
Now they lead the table and it's the only invincible team of ten.
Finally it was the superiority of his defense, as well as the fact of risking it, led the team to victory, and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
"So far they've put the test on us in our party and we're still invincible, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "You must recognize that Ayr has taken advantage of opportunities better than ours."
The 14th minute essay by Grant Anderson, transformed by Frazier Climo, put forward the Ayr, but a yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, surrendered to the Warriors party, allowed Melrose to make the numbers speak and Jason Baggot caught a wrong launch.
Climus increased the advantage for Ayr with a penalty, before he, just in the middle of time, turned a single shot, leaving score 17-5 in favor of Ayr at rest.
But Melrose started well the second half and Patrick Anderson's essay, transformed by Baggot, reduced the advantage to five points.
Then there was a prolonged arrest for the serious injury that Ruaridh Knott suffered, who abandoned the camp into a padiola and, from the beginning, Ayr advanced further through an essay by Stafford McDowall, transformed by Climus.
Captain d'Ayr, Blair Macpherson, received a yellow card and Melrose took advantage of having one more player with an essay by Bruce Colvine that was not consumed, at the end of a period of great pressure.
However, the local team came back and when Struan Hutchinson received the yellow card for marking Climo when he didn't have the ball, McPjherson scored an essay from the penalty line at the back of Ayr's maul.
Climus marked, as he did almost since the reinitiation, after Kyle Rowe had collected the launch in David Armstrong's area and had sent him to Gregor Henry's third line to get the fifth essay from the local team.
The protagonist of Still Game begins a new career in the restoration industry
Still Game's star, Ford Kieran, seems to be ready to enter the restaurant industry after discovering that he was appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, who writes and co-protagonizes with his old partner Greg Hemphil.
The duo announced that the next ninth season will be the final one, and it seems Kierman plans another life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he's the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment, although a Scottish Sun source suggested Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's next restaurant business.
'The sea is ours': inside Bolivia expects the court to make its way to the Pacific
The sailors guarded a naval headquarters covered with devices in La Paz.
Public buildings wave a blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are flooded with the slogan: "The sea is ours by right.
Recovering it is a duty."
In Bolivia without a sea, the memory of a coast lost to Chile in a bloody 19th century resource conflict remains alive, just as the longing to sail back through the Pacific Ocean.
Perhaps those hopes are at their highest point in decades, as Bolivia expects an international court decision on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the necessary momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and of course expects a positive outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the CIX's sentence on giant screens across the country in the hope that the Hague Court will speak in favour of Bolivia's claim and that, after decades of intermittent conversations, Chile will be obliged to negotiate the concession to Bolivia of a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president, who faces a controversial struggle for re-election next year, also has a lot at stake in Monday's sentence.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts consider it unlikely that the court would justify Bolivia, and that it would change little if that happened.
The United Nations agency based in the Netherlands has no power to adjugate Chilean territory, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the CIX sentence comes only six months after the final arguments we hear indicate that the case "was not complicated," says the Chilean expert in international law Paz Zárate.
And far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, the last four years could have delayed it.
"The issue of access to the sea has been blocked for a long time by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morales' belligerent rhetoric undermined Chile's remaining goodwill, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume conversations at some point, but it will be very difficult to keep them after this.
The two countries haven't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court would make an unusually rapid decision.
On Monday Bolivia will have "a fantastic opportunity to open a new stage of relations with Chile," and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreement with each other's benefits.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using this subject for political purposes.
"Bolivia will never give up her right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The sentence is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen unless it can be trusted in the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong declares that his nation will not proceed to nuclear disarmament if he cannot trust Washington.
Laughed on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made during a summit in Singapore among its leaders.
This comment is being made at a time when the U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, seems to be about to restart nuclear diplomacy stagnant for more than three decades after the summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong One.
Ri claims it's "an utopia" that the continued sanctions and objections of the United States to a declaration that ends the Korean War manages to bend to the North.
In Washington, it resists to accept the statement without Pyongyang taking the first step towards disarmament.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is the generalized skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about renouncing an arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows reveal the last line of giant hats that will soon be in the shops.
If you want to increase your collection of hats or it's covered entirely from the sun, don't look any more.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed in the gateway a series of extravagant accessories for their spring-summer 2019 collection that captivated the audience with the purest style of Paris Fashion Week.
The impossible hats filled Instagram this summer and these designers pulled their most surprising creations out of the gateway.
Valentino's main piece was an exaggerated kiss hat adorned with a wide fan mimicking feathers that flooded the heads of the models.
Among other accessories of great size were soaked sandals, a magician's hat and even a pine, but they were not designed to protect the head from the cold.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of strange masks... just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had their lips sewn and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than the high seam.
One of the creations seemed a complete dive team, with the glasses and the tube, and others a melted ice cone.
And if you're a fan of huge fashion, you're lucky.
Fashioned people predicted that giant hats could reach the shops.
The disproportionate hats come right after the "Bomb", the straw hat with a 60-inch blade that takes everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The brand of worship behind the impossible hat that invades all social networks brought to the gateway another great creation: a beach bag of straw almost as large as the model tied up in a bathing suit that carries it.
The orange rabies bag adorned with rabies flakes and finished with a white leather handle, was the highlight of the spring collection summer 2019 by Jacquemus' La Riviera on Paris Fashion Week.
The stylist of famous Luke Armitage declared to FEMAIL: 'I hope large hats and beachbags arrive at the shops next summer, as the designer had such a big impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversize accessories.'
John Edward: Language skills are essential for citizens of the world
Scotland's private schools maintain a history of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another collection of outstanding results in the exams, which is only reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community subjects.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (CIS for their English acronyms), strive to offer the best level to students and their parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for higher education, for the career they choose and their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desired theme within schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak a man in a language he understands, that comes to his mind.
But if you speak to him in his own language, he will reach his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to establish relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's recent exams, we can see that languages are on the top of the board and with higher approval rates in private schools.
About 68% of students who studied foreign languages obtained an outstanding degree.
The data, compiled from the 74 schools that make up the SCIS, show that 72% of students obtained a degree of honor in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French, and 63% of those who studied Spanish, also achieved an outstanding degree.
This demonstrates that Scottish private schools support languages and consider them key skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Now, languages are having the same consideration as subjects like science, technology, engineering and mathematics in private school programs and all kinds of subjects.
A survey carried out by the United Kingdom Employment and Training Commission in 2014 indicated that among the lack of language knowledge is 17% of the reasons why employers find it difficult to fill vacancies.
So language skills are increasingly essential to preparing youth for their future careers.
These skills are essential in a globalized world, as there are more work possibilities that need languages.
Regardless of the chosen career, learning a second language will have a real advantage in the future with life skills like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will put a bilingual person directly at the head of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey among more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75% didn't speak any foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, in this case 15%.
That's why it's so important to invest in a language for children today.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developing economies, gives children more opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, teaching languages differ according to school.
Some schools focus on the most classic modern languages, while others focus on languages considered more important for the United Kingdom by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of what your children's interests are, private schools always have different languages to choose from and specialized teachers in this field.
Scottish private schools specialize in providing a learning environment that prepares children and teams with the skills they need to succeed, whatever their future may be.
We cannot deny that at present, in a global business environment, languages are still of vital importance to the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communicative skills".
Private schools will continue to offer this diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
We've got to do it right.
John Edwards is director of the Scottish Council of private schools.
Lebron starts with Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for the eveningrs who want to see LeBron James playing for the first time with Los Angeles Lakers.
The team coach, Like Walton, announced that James will play the initial game of the pre-game against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it's still up to you to decide how many minutes you'll be playing.
"It'll be over 1 and less than 48," Walton said on the official Lakers website.
Lakers' reporter Mike Trudell posted on Twitter that James would probably play a few minutes.
After the start-of-week training, James was asked for his plans for six Lakers matches.
At this point in my career, I don't need pre-emptive parties to be ready," he said.
Trump's election events arrive in Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts a series of campaign meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It will be the first of Trump's 5 scheduled rallies for next week, including stops in cities next to him such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With a standing confirmation vote for your candidate to fill the vacancy of the Supreme Court, Trump intends to get support for the next half-term elections, since Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when they vote in November.
What time is Trump's meeting in West Virginia and how can you see it on the Internet?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for today Saturday, September 29, 2018 at 7 p.m. ET.
You can see Trump's rally in West Virginia following via live broadcast via YouTube.
Trump will probably deal with the subject of the trial held this week to the Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, who has become tense by accusations of inappropriate sexual conduct and who keeps the Senate's confirmation vote suspended for a week while the FBI is investigating.
But the main objective of this series of rallies is to help the Republicans face the November elections with a new boost.
So these five rallies that Trump will give next week aim to "dynamicize volunteers and sympathizers while Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and in the House of Representatives," says Reuters.
"Congress's control is as important to his agenda as the president will travel to as many states as possible towards the campaign season," said Reuters a Trump campaign spokesman who preferred not to be appointed.
The rally tonight, to be held at Wesbanco Stadium, could gather supporters of Ohio and Pennsylvania and get media coverage from Pittsburgh, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate from West Virginia to the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, last in the polls.
"It's not a good symptom for Morrisey that the president should come to support him in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a polytologist at the University of West Virginia at Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows endurance to fight and keep hope alive until Sunday's individual parties
After three individual sessions, the Saturday afternoon ant might have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swaying impulse pendulum is a completely invented sporting concept but in what athletes really believe, and above all in competitions like this.
So where would you say the impulse is now?
"They had a six-point advantage, and now there are four, so I suppose we're taking that as a little boost," said Jordan Spieth as he was leaving at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has four advantage points with twelve more at stake.
The Americans, said Spieth, feel they have a little wind in favor and a lot to cheer on, among other things the technique of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each count with three points of four.
Spieth was lethal from tea to green and he's preaching with the example.
Those gutural screams became stronger as he advanced his round, making a crucial putt to tie the fourth party when he and Thomas were two points below after two.
By getting the putt that made them win the game in the 15th, he gave them a similar shout, the kind of scream that says he thinks the U.S. team isn't out yet.
"You just have to concentrate and worry about your game," said Spieth.
It's the only thing left to these players now.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, Ryder Cup's indisputable story.
The strange but adorable European couple have four out of four and they can't be wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't do a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided them on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and not the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That journey, and the way in which it seems to flow its energy into the crowd and from it, confirms them as the rivals beat on Sunday, and there could be no more popular players to achieve a victory when the sun is set on Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, talking about European glory is still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly dispatched Sergio García, the morning's fourball hero, when he paired up with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first trip ended with Spanish and Swedish in a hole they were never near to get out.
But on Sunday there won't be anyone to help get out of the hole.
Fourballs and forsomes are so fascinating to see closely the interactions between couples, the advice they give themselves, that they don't and how they can change a strategy in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has a significant advantage on the last day, but this forsome session has also shown that Team USA has the strength to fight, which some, especially Stateside, doubted.
Europe has a 10-6 advantage on Ryder Cup's last day.
Europe will enjoy a good advantage on Ryder Cup's last day after leaving the fourballs and forsomes with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
The inspired duo formed by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two victories over a Tiger Woods with difficulty to raise four points to the score at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, which seeks to preserve the trophy they lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated an American team that failed in morning fourballs, putting on the 3-1 series.
The U.S. offered more resistance to the forsomes, winning four matches, but they couldn't cut the advantage.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from Sunday's 12 individual games to preserve the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points of the four initial games in Ryder Cup's history.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed into fourballs, they fit perfectly to defeat a bouncy Woods and the new American Bryson Dechambeau with 5 & 4 more categoricals.
Woods, who fought two matches on Saturday without grief or glory, showed occasional bursts of brightness, but now he lost 19 of 29 matches in the modalities of fourballs and forsomes and five in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested in the morning's ovenballs, reunited with his partner Henrik Stenson in the forsomes taking a defeat in front of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, numbers one and three of the world's.
Europe could not always win on a pleasant day of breeze in the southwest of Paris.
The three times champion Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the point of reference for Americans getting two points on Saturday.
They won a 2&1 victory over Spanish John Rahm and Ian Poulter in the ovenballs and won Poulter and Rory McIllroy 4&3 in the forsomes after losing the first two holes.
There were only twice in Ryder Cup's history where a team went up four points in the individual, although as a current trophy holder, Furyk's team just needs to tie it up to keep it.
However, after being the second best in two days, a counterattack on Sunday seems to be out of reach.
North Korea says no to unilateral disarmament if it is not trusted
North Korean Foreign Minister informed the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions increased their distrust in the United States and that the country would not hand over its nuclear weapons under those circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant measures to show its goodwill" last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear testing camps and committing itself to the proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"But we don't see the corresponding answer from the United States," he added.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in such circumstances, there will be no unilateral disarmament first on our part."
While Ri resumed the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "gradual" denuclearization under which North Korea would be rewarded as he took measures, his statement seemed important, since he did not reject unilateral denuclearization as had happened with Pyongyang in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between an active US president and a North Korean leader held in Singapore on June 12, when Kim committed himself to the "denuclearization" of the Korean peninsula while Trump guaranteed North Korea's security.
North Korea has been looking for a formal end for the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has declared that Pyongyang must first deposit its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted to relax the harsh international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on "denuclearization first" and increases pressure by sanctions to achieve its coercive policy goal, and even if they oppose the "declaration of the end of the war," said Ri.
"The perception that sanctions can make us kneel is an impossible dream, for those who don't know us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions are aggravating our distrust."
Ri didn't mention the plans for the second peak between Kim and Trump that the US leader mentioned in the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
However, he spoke of three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the other part of this issue of denuclearization were South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached a dead point."
Still, the tone of Ri's speech was radically different from last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly it was inevitable to attack the United States with North Korean missiles after the "bad president" Trump called Kim "a man rocket on a suicide mission.
This year in the UN, Trump, who last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for her bravery in taking action for disarmament, but said that much work remains to be done and that sanctions must remain until North Korea denuclearizes.
Wednesday Trump said it hadn't ended for that, and that "it still takes two years, three or five months."
China and Russia discuss whether the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, on Thursday, the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council that, "The compliance with the sanctions of the Security Council must continue firmly and without exception until we observe complete, final and verified denuclearization."
The Security Council unanimously increased sanctions in North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to cut funds for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompey met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and then commented that he would return to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompey has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip didn't work out well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that he had advanced, just a few hours before North Korea denounced him for making "mafia demands."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to dismantle a missile deployment, as well as a nuclear complex, if the United States adopted the "corresponding measures".
He pointed out that Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" he asked for were the security assurances Trump promised in Singapore and the progress towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to rest enough
This year, a new Harvard University course is making all its students sleep longer in order to combat the growth of the male culture of studying all night stimulated by caffeine.
An academic discovered that university students number one in the world often don't know the basics about how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard School of Medicine and specialist at Brigham Hospital and Muller, designed the course, which he believes is the first of this type in the United States.
He aspired to start the course after giving a talk about the impact that sleeplessness had on learning.
"At the end of the course, a girl approached me and said, 'Why are you only telling me this now, in my last year?'
He said no one had talked to him about the importance of sleeping, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was launched this year for the first time, explains to students the basic aspects of how to acquire good sleep habits helps with academic and athletic performance, as well as improves general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university health services, said the university decided to present the course after discovering that students had an important lack of sleep during the week.
The course of an hour implies a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there's a picture of a bedroom, where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, trainers and books to get information about the effects of caffeine and light and how sleep deficit affects athletic performance, as well as the importance of having a routine in bed.
In another section, participants are informed how prolonged sleeplessness can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it won't change students' behavior immediately.
But we think they have the right to know this information, just as we have the right to know what the health effects are if we choose to smoke tobacco," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride of spending all night awake still exists, he says, and he adds that modern technology and increasing pressure for students who implied sleeplessness was a growing problem.
Ensuring that she sleeps enough and that she has a good quality sleep must be a student's "secret weapon" to combat stress, tiredness and anxiety, marks. Even avoid getting fattened, since sleeplessness causes her brain to enter into mode of extinction, which constantly makes her hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student of chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after attending one of his classes last year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to drive a course across the campus.
The next step, waits, is to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting up an alarm to lie down, as well as when they wake up. Also, it is recommended that they be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" that emit electronic screens and LED lighting, which can debalance the circadian rhythm and cause trouble sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal overthrows Gerard's men
The Rangers suffered another sad episode when Dolly Menga's attack relegated Steven Gerard's disjointed team to a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The team of Hemox intended to record his first victory at home since the 4-1 win in February in St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team led to Gerard's second defeat in 18 games as a coach, which left his team eight points from the Hearts, leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership, the Scottish League.
Menga attacked seven minutes before the break and a low-inspired alignment of the Rangers never gave the feeling that he was going to draw.
While the Rangers descended to the sixth position, Livingston went up to the third place and is only behind Hibernian with a goal of difference.
And it could have been much worse for the Rangers after the Calum Spence line judge had to have treated for a head wound after the supposed launch of an object.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that slammed Ayr in the semifinals of Betfred Cup, the Scottish League Cup.
On the other hand, Holt was with the same 11 from Livingston that drew a point to the Hearts last week and would have been delighted by the way his organized group suffocated its opponents at all times.
The Rangers may have mastered the possession, but Livingston did much more when they had the ball.
They could have scored in just two minutes when the short passage of Menga's first time sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's gate, but the midfielder wasted this great opportunity.
A powerful shot free of Keaghan Jacobs arrived at Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, only managed to nail him to the second pole.
The Rangers took control, but they seemed to have more hope than conviction about their game in the offensive area.
Without a doubt, Alfredo Morelos felt that they would have been penalized at 15 minutes when he and Steven Lawless were shocked, but the referee, Steven Thomson, ignored the Colombian's claims.
The Rangers only shot two shots at the door in the first half, but the old Hemox watchman, Liam Kelly, just had trouble with Lassana Coulibaly's head finish and Ovie Ejaria's attack.
While the opening of Livingston in the minute 34 might have gone against the logic of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for their hard work.
Rangers failed again in dealing with the strong formation of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher fit the ball into Scott Robinson, who kept the cold blood to choose Menga for a simple end.
Gerard acted in his break by changing Coulibaly to Ryan Kent, changing that almost had an immediate effect when the south made a pass to Morelos, but imposing Kelly ran from his line to block him.
But Livingston continued to devour the visitors by playing exactly the kind of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett collecting a long ball after another.
Holt's team might have extended the advantage in the final moments, but McGregor stood up perfectly to reject Jacobs before Lithgow was headed from the corner.
Rangers' replacement, Glenn Middleton, called for another penalty when he got entangled with Jacobs, but Thomson had a fat look again.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and CONTADE... was the day Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that finally led him to the device known as the Geiger counter.
A pyramid of science since then, the Geiger counter has also become a fundamental element of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring those seemingly unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is that in the world?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
By putting on these headphones, you can listen to the effects of atoms emitted by the radioactivity of minerals."
Evans: "Say, I'm sure you're popping up now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days after his 63th birthday.
But the invention bearing his name survives.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" defective cells
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" defective cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize defective cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory
They can "see" a protein common to various types of cancer and re-inject it
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize defective cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, which are altered in the laboratory so they can "see" a protein common to various types of cancer called HER2 and then reject cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. Institute for Cancer in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results indicate we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "pulse the growth of various types of cancer," including breasts, ovaries, lungs, and colorectals, explained Professor Berzofsky.
An approach similar to the extraction of immune cells from patients and "teaching" to approach cancer cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarked on a speech for Trump by using a MAGA (Make America Great Again) hat after his appearance in the Saturday Night Live (SNL) program.
And the result wasn't good
During a Saturday Night Live program, they approved Kanye West in the studio after a confusing presentation in which he commended the president of the United States, Donald Trump, and said he would run as a candidate in 2020.
After playing the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, in which he wore a Make America Great Again hat, he criticized the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I often talk to a white man and say, "How can you like Trump if he's racist?"
If I was worried about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the program with a satire starred by Matt Damon, in which Hollywood's star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the U.S. Senate Judicial Committee on sexual assault demands made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it hasn't been issued, Chris Rock has uploaded the images of West's criticism of social networks.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to make fun of West with this publication.
Besides, West complained to the audience that he had had spent a bad time behind the scenes because of his hat.
"They passed me behind the scenes.
They said, 'Don't go out with that hat'.
I was intimidated!
And then they said I was going to pick it up," said Washington Examiner.
West went on, "Do you want to see how I'm going to be peaking?" He said, "I'd use my superman's hat, because it means you can't tell me what to do."
Try love."
His comments provoked apocalypse in the audience at least twice and the members of the SNL cast seemed to be ashamed, informed Variety magazine, with the following testimony that a person who was there gave the publication: "All the study remained in absolute silence."
They had nominated West as the last substitute for Ariana Grande, whose old boyfriend, the boyfriend Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West has left a lot of people puzzled by an interpretation of song I love it, dressed like a Perrier bottle of water.
West obtained the support of the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote the following tweet: "For one of the bravest spirits: FREE TO FRONT THE MAFIA"
However, the host of an interview program, Karen Hunter, wrote a tweet saying that West was just "being who it is and that's completely wonderful."
"So, I chose NOT to reward anyone (buying his music or clothes or supporting his art) who I think is hugging and spreading an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
Just like us," he added.
Before the show, the rapist announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that now it was "the officially known as Kanye West."
He's not the first artist to change his name; he follows the steps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Snoop Dogg had the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the last music legend, Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then the artist formerly known as Prince.

The Star of Game of Thrones, Kit Harington, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role in handling the sword like Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantastic series of HBO Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of male hero, saying that these roles on the screen translate into what it seems young people often have to be tough to respect.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that "something has failed" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era (#ITamen).
Kit, who recently married the co-protagonist of Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also aged 31, admitted that he feels "strong enough" to address the problem.
"Personally, am I feeling pretty strong right now, when are we wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What do we teach men when they grow up, in terms of the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its very male characters.
He continued: "What is innate and what taught?
What is taught on television and on the streets; what makes young people feel that they have to be that particular part of being men?
I think it's really one of the big questions of our time; how do we change that?
Because, obviously, something went wrong with the boys."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not make any prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones when the series came to an end next summer, asserting that " enough horses and battlefields."
Starting in November, Kit will feature a replacement for True West (the real west) by Sam Shepard, who tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that he considered his encounter with his wife, Rose, to be the best of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on this show, so somehow she provided me with my future family and my life from here on out," she said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in Emmy's winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 in the land of Leslie's family heritage in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS.
It affects more than 820,000 people in the country, declared the health authorities.
40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases have been sexually transmitted, which marks a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has been spread rapidly by some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV in this way was almost zero, said the Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, over the years, the number of people living with HIV or AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
The sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was discriminated against in China in 1997, but they ensure that discrimination against LGBT people has spread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that between 70 and 90% of men having sexual intercourse with other men will end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of disease come from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the government of China has promised universal access to HIV mediation as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member leaked data from Republican Party senators, "dangerous liars" and "conspirator theories"
On Saturday, U.S. representative Maxine Waters denounced the allegations that a member of his staff had published personal information from three U.S. Republican Party senators on the Wikipedia pages of the legislators.
The democrat of Los Angeles Democrat stated that the statements were being made by websites and commentators of the "ultraright".
"False lies, lies, and more infamous lies," Waters remarked in a Twitter statement.
According to reports, the information disseminated included the private addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person in Capitol Hill, the U.S. government headquarters, during a hearing in the Senate panel on allegations of improper sexual conduct against the Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak appeared a little after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the publications was associated with the Waters department and revealed the information of a member of the Waters staff, reported Capitol Hill.
"This unfounded accusation is totally false and a complete lie," continued Waters.
"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these false and fraudulent accusations, was in no way responsible for leaking this information.
This unfounded accusation is totally false and a complete lie."
The Waters statement immediately sparked online criticism, including those of the former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This disbelief became angry," wrote Fleischer.
"It makes sense that he has no temper to be a member of Congress.
When they accuse someone of something he didn't do, he shouldn't be angry.
It mustn't be challenging.
You mustn't question the defendant's motives.
It must remain apraceable and with serenity."
It seemed that Fleischer was comparing Waters' reaction to the criticism of the Kavanaugh Democrats, whom critics accused of being too angry during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who presented himself to take over Waters in the mid-term elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Very strong if true" shared in a tweet.
In his statement, Waters said his department warned "the law enforcement authorities and appropriate authorities of these fraudulent charges.
"We will make sure to discover the culprits," he continued, "as well as that they are legally held responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all and every member of my team."
Johnny's criticism English Strikes Again (Johnny English: Again in action), Rowan Atkinson's powerless spy parody
It is already traditional to look for Brexit's transcendence in new films from a British point of view and it seems that this can be applied to the return of the franchise of this parody and comedy of action of Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn ("Johnny English Returns").
Will it become the ironic satire about the matter of the evidently stupid we are at the new opportunity of exporting the nation?
In any case, Johnny English's incompetent eye characters jumps and rubber face renewed his license to ruin things for the second time. His name is already a clear indication that it's a general comic creation designed for non-Anglophone film territories.
Of course, it's the stupid secret agent who, despite his outstretched claims of flattery glamur, has a bit of Clouseau, a bit of Mr. Bean and a piece of that guy who contributed with a single note on the theme of Fire Cars at the 2012 London Olympic opening ceremony.
It's also originally based on the cosmopolitan and mysterious international agent Atkinson once played in Barclaycard's now forgotten television ads, where he sowed chaos in his footsteps.
There's a couple of good moments on Johnny English's last exit.
I love it when Johnny English approaches a helicopter while wearing a medieval armor suit and the rotor steps make a short crash against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy leaps into sight, but it gives the impression that humor has little strength and is strangely superfluous, especially when these kinds of "serious" films, such as 007 and the Impossible Mission, already use comedy convincingly as one of its ingredients.
It seems as if humor was directed at children instead of adults, and, in my opinion, Johnny English's extravagant misfortunes are not as ingenious or concentrated as film jokes change from Atkinson incarnate Bean's character.
Now the permanent topical argument is that Britain has serious problems.
A cyber pirate infiltrates Britain's supersecret web spy network and reveals the identities of all British agents in the area, to the anguish of the service agent, an unfortunate little role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the culmination for a pompous and conflicting prime minister, who has already suffered a total crisis of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of himself with this character that almost looks like Theresa May, but you can't do much with the script.
Your intelligence advisors inform you that as all active spies have committed themselves, you must remove someone from the retreat.
And that refers to the incompetent Johnny English himself, who now works as a teacher in some snob institution, but gives off-official classes about how to become an infiltrated agent; in this part there are some jokes, when English offers the spy academy to a rock school.
They take English back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and meet with their former and suffering partner Bough, reinterpreted by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a man married to a submarine captain, an enthusiastic role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little lost.
So the Batman and Robin of the mistakes of His Majesty's Secret Service are returning to action, meeting the beautiful mortal wife of Olga Kurylenko, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously succumbing to the charm of the technological multimillionaire charismatic who claims he can solve British computer problems: sinister Jason Returna, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their hate of ridiculous falcatrusades: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a ostentatious French restaurant; they create a tumult that illegally puts them on board the luxury yacht of Volta; and English provokes total anarchy by trying to use virtual reality helmets to familiarize themselves with the interior of the house of Volta.
Of course, all arrests come out of that last sequence, but in the kind and scandalous way it is, it seems to be taken out of a children's television show.
The result is quite regular.
And, like the other films of Johnny English, I couldn't help thinking: the British film industry can't offer Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talent?
The Labour Party denies that it is designing a plan for the British to work four days a week, but cover for five days.
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn is considering a radical plan that will make the British work four days a week, but cover for five
Presumably, the party wants entrepreneurs to pass on the savings achieved through the artificial intelligence (IA) revolution to the workers by offering them an additional day off.
In this way, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but they would still get the same salary.
The sources say the idea would "adjust" the party's economic agenda and its plans to tilt the country to the workers' favor.
The Congress of Trade Unions supported four days a week's shifts as a measure for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
An important source of the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"It won't happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is an ambition that fits the party's focus to balance the economy for the worker, as well as the party's general industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, since the Green Party promised a four-day workweek during its 2017 general election campaign.
At present, however, the Labour Party does not support ambition in its entirety.
A Labour Party spokesperson said, "A four-day workweek doesn't get into party politics and it's not being considered for this one."
The shady chancellor, John McDonnell, used last week's Labour Party conference to strengthen his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of "anonymous directors" and "speculators" in public service companies.
The chancellor's plans in the shadow also imply the possibility that current shareholders of water companies will not recover all their investment, as a labor government could make "deductions" because of perceived irregularities.
It also confirmed plans to place workers in business councils and create inclusive property funds to deliver 10% of private sector shares to employees, who charge annual dividends worth up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" if FBI investigation about Kavanaugh could make them change their mind
The FBI investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed at least one week's final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court.
On Sunday, at an interview, the 60-minute reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could shed light on something that would lead them to change their mind.
Kennedy proved to be more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said I'd go to the audience, and I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the charge came out and asked him if he had.
It was firm, determined, round."
However, Graham's vote seems to be unmovable.
"My opinion of Brett Kavanaugh is decided and would make an explosive accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened; but I know the following: Brett denied it roundly," added Graham referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And the people you mentioned couldn't verify it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and did something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event that has an impressive poster of stars that will act and an equally impressive mission, to end world poverty.
In its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see thousands of people coming to the Great Lawn area of Central Park, not only to enjoy performances like those of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the real goal of the event of ending poverty before 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), the assistant audience had to complete a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call or any other significant way to help raise awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
But what is the degree of success of the 12-year-old Global Citizen to achieve its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a genuine way to persuade people to ask for measures or is it just another case of so-called "clichtivism", people who think that marks the difference when signing an online request or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its followers, pushing a set of different goals.
He claims that these actions helped to stimulate world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion established to influence the lives of more than 2250 million people before 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements derived from their actions, of which at least $10 billion had already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that so far the guaranteed funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK investor and executor society that has committed itself to "helping children develop to their maximum potential," with a promise to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4700 tweets from Global Citizen.
"With the support of the UK government, the donors, the national authorities and Global Citizen supporters like you, we can convert the social injustice of malnutrition into a footnote in history," said The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman during a live concert in April 2018 in London.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions have been taken to improve the nutrition of mothers and children in the United Kingdom, the government has announced funds for the The Power of Nutrition project that will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on your website, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied, "It'll be a long and difficult road and sometimes we'll fall and fail.
But just like the big anti-apartheid movements and in favor of the civil rights that precede us, we will achieve it, because together, we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae are some of the artists who will be performing this year's event in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy to perform a "block" to hinder Russia's energy exports, announced the U.S. Home Secretary
"If necessary," Washington could use the Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, revealed the U.S. Secretary of the Interior, Ryan Zinke, as Washington Examiner quoted.
Zinke claimed that Russia's commitment to Syria, especially where it operates at legitimate government level, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think the reason they're in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate with energy the same way they did in Eastern Europe," he said, as reported.
Besides, according to the officer, they have the means and the means to face it.
"The United States has the capacity, along with the Navy, to ensure that the sea lanes are open and, if necessary, to block them to ensure that their energy does not go to the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the Consumer Energy Alliance event, a non-profit group called himself the "power consumer voice" in the United States.
He compared Washington's strategies to deal with Russia and Iran, given that in practice it's about the same.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia is, more or less, to take advantage of and replace fuels," he commented, while referring to Russia saying that "he only has a tactic" with a hydrocarbon-dependent economy.
The statements were made while Trump's administration was on a mission to boost exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, in order to replace Russia's, the cheapest option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including the president himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "indecent" North Stream 2 pipeline project, which, Trump said, turned Berlin into "cautious" Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 pipeline of $11 billion, which has been established to double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic metres, is a mere economic project.
The Kremlin argued that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is only argued for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the idea that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers must be able to choose suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after the meeting with the US Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who took place in Moscow in September.
The position of the United States got Germany's reaction, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German industry leader organization, the German Federation of Industries (BDI, for its acronyms in German), appealed to the United States to withdraw from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, President of the BDI, after a recent meeting between the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will carefully examine her presidential candidacy in 2020, says Senator from Massachusetts
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said he would carefully examine his candidacy for the presidency after the midterm elections.
During a public assembly in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidacy.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and notice the broken government and that includes a woman in power," he said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I shall carefully examine my candidacy for the presidency."
Warren commented on President Donald Trump during the public assembly, stating that he was "taking this country in the wrong direction.
"I'm very worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren was frank in his criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren commented on a tweet of course an FBI investigation is necessary before the vote.
However, in a survey published on Thursday, it has been shown that most of Warren's own voters don't think they're going to show up in 2020.
Fifty percent of Massachusetts' "probables" voters said that the senator would not submit her candidacy, according to the survey of the Suffolk University Political Research Centre and the Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported this candidacy.
The survey showed more support for the former governor's candidacy, Deval Patrick, with 38 percent support for a possible candidacy and 48 percent against it.
Other prominent names of the Democrats in relation to a possible candidacy in 2020 include former vice president Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide it officially before January, reported the Associated Press agency.
Sarah Palin quotes the post-traumatic stress disorder (PTTE) of Donald Trump's non-mitin track Palin
26-year-old Track Palin spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and accused of an incident of domestic violence
"With what my own son is going on, with what is going on again, I can see myself reflected in other families who sense the consequences of the TEPT and some of the wounds our soldiers return to," he explained to the audience at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin said that his arrest was a taboo issue and that his son and other veterans of war, "turn different, hardened, wondering if there is respect for what the comrades of militia and airmen, as well as other members of the army, offered the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman, which interferes with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon at the same time as he was drunk, according to Dan Bennett, spokesperson for the Wasilla police department.
18 states and the District of Columbia challenge the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal remedy in connection with a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence or criminal organizations.
On Friday, representatives from 18 states and the district presented a friendly report from the court in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenges politics, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff of Grace's Sessions price v. that the American Civil Liberties Union (U.S. Union for Civil Liberties) presented in August against federal policy was not revealed.
He said that his partner "and his children members of a violent criminal organization" abused her, but that American officials refused his asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
State lawyers who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum-seekers for the United States, as nations facing generalized problems with criminal organizations and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation."
"Federal legislation requires all asylum applications to be adjudged according to the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and that prohibition infringes that principle," was explained in the court's friendly report.
The prosecutors continued to debate in the report that the policy that rejects the entry of immigrants harms the American economy, explaining that they are likely to become entrepreneurs and that they "supply labour".
In June, the Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, ordered immigration judges to grant no more asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and violence from criminal organizations.
" Asylum is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion," said Sessions in their political announcement on June 11.
Asylum has never been intended to alleviate all the problems (even all the serious problems) that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the number of victims doubles in a career to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is getting worse and worse.
"The circumstances are very tense," says the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her febrile baby in the evacuation center of the slaughtered city of Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance arrives with bodies.
And clean water is scarce."
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, collecting their drowned belongings, trying to save anything they found.
There are hundreds of injured people, and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, are flooded.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who fractured their backs and shoulders, were resting outside Palu Military Hospital, where the patients were treated outdoors due to continuous and strong replicas.
The tears filled his eyes as he explained how he felt the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save us.
The ruins of the wall crushed me, I believe," told Haris the Associated Press, and added that his family was at a wedding in the city.
"I heard my wife ask for help and then just silence.
I don't know what happened to her or my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
The US ambassador accuses China of abuse with "propagandistic announcements"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in an American newspaper begging for the benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador to China accuses Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, referred to the pay supplement China Daily at Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of getting involved in the elections to the US Congress, to be held on November 6, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to get into the U.S. elections, marked what the officials of that country went to Reuters as a new phase of a growing Washington campaign to coerce China.
Although it's normal for foreign governments to publish ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in a growing trade war witnessing tariff levels on their respective imports.
According to experts from China and the United States, China's compensatory tariffs at the beginning of the commercial war were designed to prejudice state exporters like Iowa, who support the Trump Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and the former governor of Iowa, one of the leading exporters of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has harmed American workers, farmers and entrepreneurs.
In an opinion paper written by Branstad and published in the Sunday edition of Moines Register, it was stated that China "is intensifying this campaign of harassment by spreading propaganda in the US press free of charge."
"When spreading their propaganda, the Chinese government takes advantage of the appreciated American tradition of freedom of expression and press by publishing a payment announcement at Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, at the post of newspapers located at the end of this street of Beijing, there are few dissident voices and there is no real reflection of the conflicting opinions that the Chinese can have on China's worrying economic trajectory, since the media are under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he adds.
Similarly, he states that "one of the most important newspapers in China declined the offer to publish" his article, although it did not confirm what newspaper it is.
Kavanaugh's Disaster Loses Female Republican Voting A Few Days' Elections Half Mandate · Global Voices
Although many of the leading Republicans support and defend Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, despite the various charges of sexual assault, analysts warn of a violent reaction, especially from female voters, in the forthcoming half term elections.
The reactions around these accusations were numerous and most Republicans positioned themselves to proceed with the vote.
"These things cannot be undone," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell School at Syracuse University in an article published on Sunday in The Hill.
Reeher also stated that he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) last hour for an FBI investigation would be sufficient to calm the moods of angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, nor will they forget it in the near future nor in November," said Friday Karine Jean-Pierre, national advisor and spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, in Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the opponents, to the flu of "Be Close to November!" showed up in the Senate corridor, while the Republicans, under the control of the Judicial Committee, decided to proceed with the appointment of Kavanaugh, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported Mic.
"The motivation and enthusiasm of the Democrats will overcome any expectation," said Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst at the news site.
"It's true it's already high,
But it's still going to be more, especially among undecided women voters in the neighborhoods outside or those between the ages of 18 and 29, who, although they don't like the President, don't usually go to the polls.
Before Ford's public witness detailed his allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts suggested it was possible to have a violent reaction if the Republicans continued with confirmation.
"This has become a disaster for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, President of the Republican National Committee, earlier this week on the NBC News channel.
"This goes beyond the committee vote, the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will sit in the defendant's bank or not, the problem is how the Republicans managed this and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of US Priorities, a group that helps the election of Democrats on the news channel.
However, it seems that Americans are divided between believing the witness of Ford or Kavanaugh, even though they are more inclined to support the latter.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41% of the people surveyed believe completely or probably Ford's testimony, compared to 35% who support Kavanaugh's testimony.
In addition, 38 percent believe that Kavanaugh is most likely to lie during his testimony, compared to 30 percent that he thinks of Ford himself.
Following Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the charges brought by Ford, as well as those of at least one other defendant, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified to the Senate Judicial Committee under oath that Kavanaugh attacked her in a state of drunkenness when she was 17 years old.
On the other hand, Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed him the genitals at a university party when he was studying in Yale in the '80s.
The creator of the World Wide Web wants to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project of this technology legend, is a Solid-based company, Berners-Lee's open source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people can access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee chanced that the intention he hides Inrupt is to "dominate the world".
"We have to do it," he said about the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "on-line personal data store" or POD.
Lists of contacts, to-dos, calendars, music and other personal and professional tools can be included.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are available in a single browser at the same time.
All this makes this personal data store unique is that the user has complete control over who can access what information.
The company classifies this as a "personal empowerment through data".
Inrupt's idea, according to his president John Bruce, is that the company provides adequate resources, processes and skills to help Solid be available to everyone.
The company is currently formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security company owned by IBM, some developers hired to work in the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week onwards, developers around the world could create their own decentralized applications with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that neither he nor his team talked to "Facebook nor Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change that would modify their business models from one day to another.
"We don't need your permission."
In an article published on Saturday in Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of a new Solid-based website."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing the World Wide Web Consortium community at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has risen up as an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee is still the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium community, as well as of the Web Foundation and Open Data Institute organizations.
"I'm very optimistic about this new era of the web," added Berners-Lee.
Honor Bernard Vann, a cleric decorated with the Victoria Cross in World War I
The only Church of England clergyman who was awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I received a posthumous tribute in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded on September 29, 1918, in the Bellenglise and Lehaukort attack.
However, he was murdered by a sniper four days later without knowing that he had been granted the greatest British military decoration.
On Saturday, his two grandsons were responsible for discovering a memorial monument in his honor at a parade in Rushden (Northamptonshire).
Michael Vann, one of his grandchildren, highlighted the symbolism of discovering this monument just 100 years after the feat of his grandfather who deserved the title.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann directed his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Channel "through a dense fog and under the yoke of an intense machine gunfire."
Later he hurried to the line of fire and, with "great courage," led the line forward before rushing with a cannon and without anyone's help, and overthrowing three people of the enemy's detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was murdered by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions are "something he could never live with, but a lesson yet."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also placed a crown of flowers after the parade, which led the Brentwood Imperial youth band.
Michael Vann said he felt "I am honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the value of this genuine hero demonstrates it by the support of so many people."
Peppa Pig cuts out the role of MMA fans at the best time
Imagine that you've been up all night to enjoy the full Bellator 206, and when the best part comes something prevents you.
The San Jose cartel included 13 combats, being six main ones, and was being broadcast live in the United Kingdom in Channel 5.
But at 6 a.m., just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald would see the faces, the spectators of the United Kingdom were puzzled when they saw Peppa Pig show up.
Some didn't be impressed after spending so many hours awake waiting to see the fight.
One amateur described the change to these children's cartoons on Twitter as "a joke of very bad taste."
"The state legislation states that this content was not appropriate for 6 a.m., and that's why it had to change to child programming," explained Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President of Marketing and Communication from Bellator, when asked for broadcast.
"Peppa Pig, that's it."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said they'll take into account UK viewers in future programming.
"I think we can solve it when we think about repetition," said Coker.
"But if it's 6 a.m. there, we can't fix it until Sunday, which will be Monday for them.
But we're working on a solution.
When the change took place, I started to get a lot of messages and not all of them were nice.
We were trying to fix it because we thought it was a technical mistake.
But no, it was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen again.
We'll limit ourselves to five fights instead of six.
We're very angry."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality
Tom Daley, the Olympic jumper, says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but this made him find the motivation to succeed.
This 24-year-old athlete claims he didn't realize that not everyone was like him until he got to school.
Invited by the first release of the Desert Island Discs Radio 4 program led by Lauren Laverne, he explained that he started talking about the rights of homosexuals to give hope to others.
He also shared that being a father helped him to relativize the importance of winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the usual presenter of this program, is on sick leave.
As guest of the first program led by Laverne, Daley shared that she felt "below" to the rest of the people because "it wasn't socially acceptable that you liked children and girls."
He also said, "To this day, that feeling of inferiority and being different is what pushed me and gave me the necessary strength to achieve success."
I wanted to prove it was "someone" so that people wouldn't be disappointed in discovering their sexuality.
With two bronze Olympic medals, he became a prominent LGBT activist and used his appearance in the Commonwealth of Australia games to ask more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He decided to talk because he felt fortunate to be able to live openly and without fear of repercussions, and wanted to give hope to others.
The world champion three times said that he fell in love with American director Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, "it was quite a surprise."
Daley married this Oscar winner last year and claims that the 20 years of difference between them were never a problem.
"When you live so long in such a short time" (at only 14 years old he first participated in the Olympic Games and his father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find someone of your age who had experienced similar heights.
The couple had their first son in June, Robert Ray Black-Daley, and this birth made Daley totally change his perspective.
"If you asked me last year, my greatest motivation would be to win a gold medal," he says.
"But now I know that there are things much more important than an Olympic gold medal.
For me, my medal is Robbie."
Your son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 because of brain cancer.
Daley's father didn't accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked his son was a ticket to London 2012, he wanted to be in the front line.
"I couldn't tell you I wouldn't be here to occupy that first row," Daley shared.
"He was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and went at that very moment, at the time of his death, when I realized that it really wasn't invincible," he adds.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"At that moment I knew that was the dream of my life: to jump in front of a crowd in my country participating in the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
The selection of Heather Small's Proud song is not in vain either, as it is the melody that accompanied him during his preparation for the Olympics and still puts his hair on top.

A low form Mickelson ended up in Ryder Cup's bank this Saturday.
U.S. Phil Mickelson will hit a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he'll have to improve his technique so that this doesn't turn into an unhappy event.
Mickelson, who took part in the biennial event for the 12th time, stayed in the bank on the decision of Captain Jim Furyk and was unable to participate in the fourballs or the forsomes of Saturday.
Instead of being the center of action, like so many other times in the United States, the five-time champion spent the day cheering and working to improve his movements.
Although it was never the most accurate of the players, not even at the moment of their career, at the age of 48 it doesn't fit into the adjusted Le Golf National camp, where the tall grass usually punishes the wrong shots.
And in case this wasn't enough, Mickelson faces the ninth game on Sunday with the exact Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, who joined Tommy Fleetwood to win the four matches this week.
If the Americans, four points below the beginning of the 12 individual games, start with good feet, Mickelson's performance could be totally crucial.
Furyk trusted his man, though he could not say much more.
"He perfectly understood the role he played today, slapped me in the shoulder, handed me his arm and told me that tomorrow he would be ready," Furyk said.
"I fully trusted myself.
He has a prominent place in the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to the teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't think I'd played two games.
I thought I'd play more, but in the end that's the way things are and so we thought they should be.
Like everyone else, he wants to be out there."
On Sunday, Mickelson will be outnumbering Nick Faldo's record in the largest number of games played at Ryder Cup.
He could mark the end of his career at the Ryder Cup, a career that never reached the level of his individual palm.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven halos, although Furyk claims that his presence also provides intangibles to the team.
"He's a funny, sarcastic person, with engineering and he likes to mess with people, he's a good guy to have on the team," he explained.
"I like to see how well the younger players spent it with him this week.
It's a lot more than a good player."
Captain of Europe Thomas Bjorn fears the disappearance of the advantage
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a considerable advantage in Ryder Cup's last day of individuals can easily become an uncomfortable journey.
The Great Danish debuted in 1997 at a game in Valderrama, where a team captained by Seven Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but ended up reaching the finish line with a minimum advantage winning 1411⁄2-131⁄2.
"You still think we had a great advantage in Valderrama; just like in Brookline, where we lost, but in Valderrama we won for a little while," Bjorn reflects, in the photo, after seeing the 2018 promotion win 5-3 on Friday and, yesterday, 10-6 on Le Golf National.
History shows that this isn't over yet.
Tomorrow we have to go all the way.
You have to get out and do the right thing.
This does not end until the points are in the bookmark.
Our goal is to win that trophy, and we have to focus on it.
I won't get tired of saying it, I'm focused on our 12 players on our side, but I'm also very aware of what's on the other side: the world's best players."
Delighted at the performance of their players in a tough golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never sing victory before.
Tomorrow we face the other beast.
Tomorrow is the day of individual performances, and there too we must prove our worth.
It's great to be with a companion next door when things go well, but when you face things individually, then you're giving the most proof of your ability as a golfer.
That's the message you need to convey to the players, to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind, and he must also get the best out of himself."
Bjorn's difference, Jim Furyk will look for their players to have a better individual performance than their peers, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points of four.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of these last day's laps, being part of the winning team at Brookline, but ending up being a loser after the European miracle at Medina.
"I remember every damn word," he answered when he was asked if he remembered how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had gathered the players face to face the last day.
"We have 12 important matches, but you'd like to have a quick start like Brookline's or Medina's.
When you see that the impulse is going in a direction, there's a lot of pressure in those intermediate parties.
We prepare our alignment by taking this into account and putting players as we thought they would, we want to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas has the task of trying to lead the fight and confront Rory McIllroy in the first game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Pollter, the other Europeans, at the top half of the ranking.
"I decided this order because I think it covers the whole way," explained Bjorn about his selection for the individual.
Germany's new warship postponed once again
The youngest German army frigate should have been delivered in 2014 to replace the old warships of the Cold War era, but it won't arrive until at least next year due to defective systems and the increasing cost, they informed the local media.
The service of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the leader ship of the flaming frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, postponed until the first half of 2019, as reported a military spokesman to the newspaper Die Zeit.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the post-delivery problems affected the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg class ships, which the Navy commissioned in 2007, will replace the old Bremen class frigates.
It is understood that they will have a powerful cannon, with different anti-airy and anti-ships missiles, as well as with concealment technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, it should be possible to expand the newer frigates up to two years outside the ports of origin.
However, as Die Zeit points out, these continuous delays mean that warships with the latest technology, and that they will allow Germany to project its power abroad, will be outdated when they enter service.
The wretched F125 frigate was reported last year, when the German Army officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned a ship to a builder after delivery.
Little did you know about the reasons behind this return, but the German media spoke of "cracial defects in software and hardware" that prevented the use of the warship on a combat mission.
The software defects were particularly important, since Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of 120 sailors; that is, half of the personnel needed in the old Bremen class frigates.
Besides, it was discovered that the ship had a dramatic excess weight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add improvements in the future.
Rheinland-Pfalz is thought to weigh twice as many as similar class ships used by Germans in World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the total cost of the project, which includes crew training, is also becoming a problem.
It's claimed to have reached the amazing amount of 3100 million euros, compared to the original 2200 million.
The problems of the newer frigates are especially important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is watering.
Early this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament defense committee, acknowledged that the Navy is running out of boats fit to expand.
The officer claims that this problem is growing, since the old ships have been withdrawn, but not replaced by others.
He also regretted that none of the frigates in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
National Trust spies on bats' secret life
A new research that is being carried out on a farm in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape to search for food.
The results are expected to shed light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
This study led by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland association will follow the bats Pipistrellus pygmaeus and Pipistrellus pipistrellus, as well as the bats Myotis daubentonii and Plecotus auritus in the gardens of Inverewe in Wester Ross.
Special recording teams will be placed at key locations around the property to track bat activities during the season.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys with manual detectors.
An analysis of sound carried out by experts of all recordings will determine the frequency of bat calls and what each species is doing.
Then a habitat map will be drawn up to create a detailed picture of the landscape scale of its behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Conservation Advisor, expects the results to show that habitat areas are more important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of grasslands, and what is the best way to maintain forests for bats and other associated species.
The bat populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined considerably in the last century.
These animals are threatened by construction and development works that affect children and habitat loss.
Aerogenerators and the lit up also pose a risk, as well as trapping for flies, some chemical treatments of building materials, and attacks of domestic cats.
The bats are not blind.
But because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when they hunt.
They use a sophisticated ecolocation technique to locate insects and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who conduct periodic surveys, inspections of children and, on occasion, even rescues.
The organization even has the only and first reserve of Scottish bats in Three Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species of Scottish bats.
David Thompson, state manager, says this is the ideal territory for them.
"In Three we have a great area for bats," he says.
"We have ancient buildings, historic trees and a great habitat.
But there's a lot of things we don't know about bats yet, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us better understand what they need to thrive."
It highlights the importance of controlling the presence of bats before carrying out maintenance tasks on property, since it is possible that the involuntary destruction of a single maternity child may kill up to 400 females and females, which could exterminate a whole local population.
bats are a protected species and it's illegal to kill them, harass them or disturb them, as well as destroy their children.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish official of the Bat Conservation Trust organization, encourages people to help:
"There's still much to learn about bats and, in the case of many species, we don't know how it's going to its populations."
Ronaldo dismisses rape claims and his lawyers prepare to sue the German publication
Christian Ronaldo qualifies the allegations of rape against him as false, claiming that the only thing people want is to get acquainted with using his name.
His lawyers will sue German magazine Der Spiegel for publishing these charges.
The foreman of Portugal and Juventus was accused of violating Kathryn Mayorga, an American woman, at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
It's alleged that the football player paid the woman $375,000 so she wouldn't say anything about the incident, published Der Spiegel on Friday.
Hours after his release, Ronaldo, 33 years old, he's leaked this false news in a live video from his Instagram account, which counts 142 million followers.
"No, no and a thousand times not.
What was said today is false," he said before the camera the five times winner of the Golden Ball.
"People want to get to know each other by my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by just saying my name, it's part of my work.
I'm a happy and respectable man," the player smiled.
Ronaldo's lawyers prepare to sue Der Spiegel for the charges, which they call "an inadmissible statement of suspicion in the privacy area" according to Reuters.
Counsel Christian Schertz said that the player would claim compensation for "moral damages for an amount corresponding to the gravity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident would have occurred in June 2019 in a suite at the Palm Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga would have returned to the player's room, where they allegedly raped her annually, according to the documents presented at Clark Nevada County District Court.
Major says that Ronaldo, after the alleged incident, kneeled and said he was a 99 percent gentleman, but that 1% had betrayed him.
The documents ensure that Ronaldo confirms that both of them maintained sexual relations agreed upon by both sides.
Major also maintains that he came to the police and had photographs of the wounded, but later agreed to an extra-judicial agreement because he felt terrified of reprisals and was worried about the public scandal.
The 34-year-old woman says she's trying to revoke the agreement while she's still traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged crime, Ronaldo was about to meet with Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer he joined the Italian giant Juve in an agreement of 100 million euros.
Brexit: Car manufacturers would leave the United Kingdom
The United Kingdom would forever regret the loss of its position as world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, according to the business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it is worrying that Toyota UK had stated in the BBC that if Britain had left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily halt the production of its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"It's necessary to reach an agreement," added Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that, in case Brexit had not reached any agreement, the impact of delays on the border could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, in charge of manufacturing the Toyota Auris and Avensis models, produced some150 000 vehicles last year, of which 90 % was exported to the rest of the EU.
"In my opinion, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will be witnesses to how production stops at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, general director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers also expressed their fear of EU abandonment without reaching agreement on the functioning of border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW confirmed that it would close its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
One of the main concerns of car manufacturers is the risk of the supply chain in case an agreement is not reached in Brexit.
Toyota's production line is very tight, every 37 minutes pieces of suppliers from the United Kingdom and the EU arrive for custom-made cars.
If on 29 March the United Kingdom left the EU without reaching an agreement, the border could be affected and delays and shortages of pieces could be generated.
The company claims it would be impossible for Toyota to maintain a normal rhythm more than one day on Derbyshire plant, so production would have to stop.
Clark claims that Theresa May's Chequers plan for future EU relations is "precisely calibrated to avoid such border controls."
"It is essential to have an agreement, and we want it to be the best agreement, so that we can enjoy the current success but also make the most of this opportunity," said BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The experience of Toyota and other manufacturers is that it is necessary to continue these excellent supply chains."
Toyota couldn't estimate how long production would stop, but he warned that in the long run the costs added would reduce the plant's competition and could even cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvalaris, employee of Burnaston for 24 years and union coordinator of the United States, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "By experience, I know that once these jobs disappear, they never return.
A government spokesman said they presented a precise and credible plan for the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the EU.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be enjoyed again
The White House said that Donald Trump's high-risk meeting and undersecretary of justice Rosenstein could be delayed one more week due to the fight by the candidate for Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special lawyer Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in elections, links between Russia's assistants and Trump, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump fires the Deputy Attorney General or not, which would endanger Mueller's independence, he fed the rumors in Washington for months.
Early this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein spoke of using a microphone to record talks with Trump and the possibility of dismissing the President through the 25th amendment.
However, Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he came to the White House, among reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was in New York on Thursday.
Trump said he'd rather not have to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a clash with the hearing of the Senate judicial committee where Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women accusing him of inappropriate sexual conduct.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week's investigation into the FBI's allegations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate vote.
Sarah Sanders, Trump's press secretary, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Before the question about the meeting with Rosenstein, he answered, "There's still no fixed date, it could be this week or it could be another week late, given all that's going on in the supreme court.
We'll see, but you know I like the press being informed."
Some journalists questioned that statement, since Sanders has been running since September 10 without holding a press conference.
When presenter Chris Wallace asked him why,
Sanders said that the lack of information sessions was not due to an aversion to the grandeurness of the reporters, although he added that it would not be her who denied that attitude.
He also suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president grants more interviews than the previous president," he said, although he did not quote any sources that endorsed that data.
Informational meetings will continue, Sanders said, but he insisted that "if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, that's much better than directing the questions to her.
You are witnesses to how we've been doing this over the past few weeks, and that will replace a press conference where you can talk directly to the president of the United States.
Trump usually answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with dignified visitors.
However, press conferences alone are scarce.
Perhaps the president has demonstrated the reason for this week in New York, with a free appearance and on strange occasions with the journalists gathered.
A letter from the Health Secretariat to calm down in front of Brexit
The Health Secretariat addressed a letter to EU workers in Scotland's NHS expressing the country's gratitude and expressing its desire to stay behind Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter less than six months after the United Kingdom left the EU.
The Scottish government has pledged to cover the cost of requests for covered status for EU citizens working in their decentralized public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on abandonment continued, and it is planned to reach decisions this fall.
However, the UK government, for its part, has also stepped up its preparations for a possible situation of disagreement.
I know this is a period of anxiety for everyone.
That's why I want to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each of the staff, regardless of their nationality.
The colleagues of the European Union and beyond provide an undeniable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here with us."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, linebacker of the Tennessee State Tigers, was submitted to an emergency surgery after a head injury during the defeat of Saturday (31-27) in front of the Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ de Tennessee.
Rod Reed, the Tennessee State trainer, informed journalists that the injury occurred shortly before the break.
Apparently, it fainted when reaching the bandwidth line.
The trainers and the medical staff gave him oxygen on the bandline before taking him on a stretcher to carry out a further evaluation.
A Tennessee State technician informed Chris Harris, WSMV journalist in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
He also added that there are still no details of the type or extent of the injury, and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second year Red T-shirt student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five tickets in total on Saturday before leaving the game, which raised his total of the season to 18th.
A stamp tax will be applied to foreign buyers who buy property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax when they buy a property in the United Kingdom. This additional money will be used to help homeless people because of their new conservative plans.
This measure will neutralize the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters
Increase in bell tax will apply to people who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax when they buy property in the United Kingdom. Theresa May will announce that this extra money will be used to help homeless people.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters with promises to promote more accessible homes and focus on people with high incomes.
The increase in stamp tax will apply to people and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the money raised will serve to support the government's campaign to reduce the number of people who sleep in the street.
The charge, which is added to the current stamp tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago for second dwellings and rental purchases, may be up to 3 %.
We hope that the change will be able to raise up to £120 million a year.
About 13% of new constructions in London are purchased by non-residents in the United Kingdom, which is causing an increase in prices and making it difficult for people who want to buy a home for the first time have more difficulty accessing the real estate market.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "phantom cities" because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy applies just weeks after Boris Johnson has applied for the application of a cut in the income tax to help new people acquire their first home.
He accused the great builders of keeping the prices of the high dwellings by buying the land and not using it, and urged Mrs. May to eliminate the percentages of tax revenue on the low-priced houses to fix the "gray of the housing sector" that is lived in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn has announced an attractive series of reform proposals relating to housing, including rent control and the ban on evictions in which the tenant is not guilty.
He also wants to grant the municipalities greater powers when building new dwellings.
Mrs May said, "Last year I said I'd devote my mandate to restoring the British dream: that life should be better for every new generation.
And that's what it takes to fix the disastrous housing market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and start a life here.
However, it's not fair that it's as simple for those people who don't live in the United Kingdom as it is for foreign-based companies to buy housing as it is for British workers.
For too many people, the dream of being the owners of a dwelling is too far away, and the indignity that supposes not having a roof remains too real."
Jack Ross: "My last ambition is to be able to train Scotland."
Sunderland's manager, Jack Ross, declared that his "last ambition" is to become the Scottish electorate at some point.
This 42-year-old Scotch is enjoying the challenge of reviving the northwest club, which currently occupies the third square in the League One, three points away from the head.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"When I was a player my dream was to play for my country.
I played once in selection B, and that was all," Ross told the BBC Scotland's Sportsound program.
"I thought I saw Scotland playing in Hampden many times with my father when I was a child, something I always wanted to live again.
But that opportunity will come only if I succeed in running a club."
Among Ross' predecessors in Sunderland's training post are Dick Advvocat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Alloa Athletic's former manager says he didn't feel any concern about the fact that these figures were so consolidated in such a large club after he had previously rejected proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Will success for me depend at this moment on whether I can return this club to the Premier League?
Because the club's structure and facilities are undoubtedly unique to a Premier League club," he said.
"It's not going to be a simple task to arrive, but it's likely that I've only found success here if I can return the club to the Premier."
Ross has only been a coach for three years after a period of assistant in Dumbarton and a 15-month period within the technical staff of Hearts.
In that period he helped Alloa recover from the descent into the third division and managed to get St Mirren from being about to go down to winning the title of the Championship the next season.
Ross claims to feel more comfortable now than ever during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"I probably found myself in a real crossroads," he recalled, about taking over the Alloa.
"I really thought that training was perfect for me, even more than playing.
It sounds weird because it didn't hurt me, I earned reasonably well my life and enjoyed some successes.
But playing can be hard.
There are many things that you must overcome every week.
I continue to suffer from stress and work pressure, but training likes it.
I always liked training and now that I'm doing it, I feel more comfortable than ever in my adult life."
You can listen to the full interview at Sportsound on Sunday, September 30 at Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 (British summer time)
According to a survey, the perfect time to take a look is 17:30 a.m. on a Saturday.
The summer heat wave increased consumption in British pubs with more difficulty, but put more pressure on the chains of restaurants.
Pubs and bars experienced a 2.7 percent increase during July, but consumption in restaurants dropped by 4.8 percent according to the figures.
Peter Martin, a member of the CGA trade council, responsible for compiling the figures, said: "The sunny days and Britain's permanence in the football world for longer than expected caused a pattern similar to that of June, in July, where pubs enjoyed an increase of 2.8 percent in consumption, although restaurants suffered even greater punishment.
The fall of 1.8 percent in the turnover of restaurants during June worsened during July.
Pubs and bars specializing in drinks were the best results obtained with increases in consumption greater than reductions experienced by restaurants.
The pubs specializing in meals also suffered the sun, although not as dramatic as restaurant operators.
Seems like people just want to get out drinking.
In controlled pubs and bars, drinking increased by 6.6 percent during the month, and food decreased by 3 percent."
Paul Newman, an employee of the RSM company for analysis of leisure and hospitality activities, said, "These results are a continuation of the trend that has been taking place since the end of April.
The time and impact of the main social and sporting events continue to be the main factors related to consumption outside the home.
It's no surprise that groups of restaurants continue to suffer, however, a fall of 4.8 percent annually will be especially painful if the continuous increase in costs is added to that.
The warm and long summer couldn't have arrived at a worse time for the restoration business and time will be responsible for saying whether the moderation of the temperatures experienced during August will provide the much needed breathing for the sector."
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent during July, which reflects the slowdown in brand launches.
The UK's Coffer Peach Tracker Industry sales indicator of pubs, bars and restaurants collects and analyzes data on the performance of 47 operating groups with a combined profit of more than 9,000 million pounds and is considered the sector's benchmark.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that hide their parents
One in five children (some only 11 years of age) have secret social media accounts that hide their parents and teachers according to a survey
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in the number of "False Institute" pages.
This news has led to an increase in fear of sexual content being published
Twenty percent of students said they had a "principal" account to show their parents
One in five children (some of them just 11 years old) are creating accounts on social networks that keep adults secret.
A survey conducted to 20,000 high school students showed a growth in the number of "False Institute" accounts (in reference to the social network for the exchange of Instagram photos).
This news has led to an increase in fear of sexual content being published.
Twenty percent of the students said they used a "principal" account smoothed to show their parents while they had other privates.
A mother who found her 13-year-old daughter's secret account found a teenager who asked for her "violation."
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40% of boys and girls between 11 and 18 years old had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
HMC leader Mike Buchanan said, "It's alarming that there are so many teenagers who are trying to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" on the council of the Scottish athletic federation
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the council of the Scottish athletic federation as the non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the board of directors.
Doyle is the most award-winning Scottish athlete and President Ian Beattie has defined this decision as an excellent opportunity for those who run the sport to benefit from their extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys a huge respect within the Scottish community, the UK and worldwide, and we are sure that Scottish athletics will benefit greatly from its incorporation into the council," said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I'm very eager to speak to athletes and I hope to be able to contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200 meters and the 400 meters in the 1996 Atlanta Games among a total of four Olympic gold and currently works as a usual commentator for the BBC, suffered a transient ischemic attack that prevented him from walking.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I suffered an apoplexy.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time could determine if I could recover myself and how much.
It was exhausting work, but I managed to recover completely, I learned to walk again and I am currently doing fast exercises.
Thank you for your encouraging messages.
An announcement from a breast milk extractor compared to women with cows divides public opinion into networks
A company of breast milk extractors divided public opinion into networks with an announcement of how to compare breastfeeding mothers with cows that are being weaned.
To announce the release of the proclaimed "first silent portable breast milk extractor in the world", Elvie published an ironic announcement in the style of a musical video to demonstrate the freedom offered by the new breast milk extractor.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of ugly for cows at the rhythm of a song with letters like the following: "Yes, I moved myself, but I don't have tail" and "Because you didn't notice, they're not drunk, they're my breasts."
The choir goes on, "Woman, Mwah, I'm feeding babies, Mwah, Mwah, Mwah, I'm watering my friends."
However, the announcement, which was published on the company's Facebook page, caused controversy on the networks.
With 77,000 reproductions and hundreds of comments, the video gave rise to different reactions among the viewers, many of whom claimed that this post manifests the "horrors" of the dairy sector.
"Using cows to advertise this product was a very poor decision.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk, but in their case we steal their children days after giving birth," wrote one.
Elvie's milk extractor can be quietly placed inside a mother's milk holder (Elvie/nai)
Another viewer commented: "Of course traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But yes, why aren't they used to advertise a milk extractor for mothers who stay with their babies?"
Another viewer added the following: "What an ad with so little tact."
Other spectators defended the ad, even a woman claimed that the song seemed "very funny."
"I think it's a great idea.
If I was still breast-feeding, I'd buy one.
Extracting my milk made me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad's a little crazy, but I played it like a joke.
It sounds like a great product," wrote one.
Another commented: "This is a fun announcement addressed to mothers who extract their milk (often in their workplaces or in bathrooms) and feel like cows."
This is not an ad to commend or judge the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, this group of women revealed that they were dancing with discreet extractors inserted in their subjects.
The concept on which the campaign is based is that many women who extract their milk claim to feel like cows.
However, Elvie's milk extractor is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and can quietly fit into a mother's bra, which gives women freedom to move, hold their babies and even get out there while they're extracting their milk.
Ana Balarin, wife and creative executive director of Mother commented: "Elvie extractor is such a revolutionary product that deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By describing the parallelism between women and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on milk extraction and all the challenges it implies while we demonstrated in an entertaining and close manner the incredible sense of freedom that the new extractor will offer.
It's not the first time that the Elvie extractor occupies the headlines of the newspapers.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two creatures paraded on the gateway to designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of emigrant children were quietly displaced to a camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children increased despite the fact that the monthly number of border crossings remained relatively invariable, partly due to the strict rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration made it difficult to assign standards for children.
Traditionally, most of the parents were also immigrants without roles and were afraid to jeopardize their ability to stay in the country by taking a step forward to claim a child.
This risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that the potential fathers and other adult members of their homes would have to send their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high-ranking U.S. Customs Immigration and Control Service, testified to Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who asked to sponsor minors without company.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no criminal record.
"About 80 percent of the people who are patrons or who are part of the home of these people are illegally found in the country, and a large part of them are foreigners who have committed crimes.
That's why we'll keep chasing these individuals," said Mr. Albence.
In order to prosecute the children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that will require one of these to appear in court before a month has passed since their detention in place of 60 days, which was the previous rule, according to the refugee workers.
Many will appear via videoconferencing instead of in person to try to legalize their case in front of an immigration judge.
Those who fail to meet the requirements for assistance will be deported quickly.
The longer they stay in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which may lead to violent robberies or attempts to escape according to the workers of the shelter and reports of the system published in recent months.
The lawyers said that these fears increase in centers of greater dimensions like that of Tornillo, in which there is a greater possibility that the symptoms of a child having a hard time go unnoticed due to its size.
They also added that moving the children to the camp area without giving them enough time to prepare them from an emotional point of view or to say good-bye to their friends could be a trauma that many continue to suffer.
Syria requests the U.S. occupying forces, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
The Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, addressing the UN General Assembly, also asked the Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also holds the position of Deputy Prime Minister, declared that foreign forces were found on Syrian soil illegally, on the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they would "take care of it in a timely manner".
"They must retire immediately and without conditions," he communicated to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions of them have had to flee their homes.
He also stated that Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we clear all Syrian territories" of terrorist groups and "all illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly to train and advise the Kurdish forces and the Arab Syrians who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 soldiers in this war-torn country.
On the subject of refugees, Moualem stated that the conditions for their return were given and blamed "some Western countries" for the "dissemination of irrational fears" that caused the refugees not to return.
"We use the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They're politicizing what should be a mere humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not offer aid for reconstruction for Syria until a political agreement has been reached between Assad and the opposition to put an end to the war.
UN diplomats claim that the recent agreement reached between Russia and Turkey to establish a neutral zone in the last major rebel bastion of Idlib has allowed political talks to continue.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey avoided a large-scale assault by Syrian troops supported by Russia in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem pointed out that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed his hope that the military actions would be targeted by the Shihadists, including the Al-Nusra front soldiers linked to Al-Qaeda, who would be " eradicated".
The envoy of UN Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition to draw up a draft of a post-war constitution for Syria and to facilitate the holding of elections.
Moualem set out the conditions to ensure the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that the work of the body should be restricted to "revising the articles of the current constitution" and warned against possible interference.
Why Trump's gonna win a second term
Following that logic, Mr Trump would be able to re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberals are waiting, impeachment and scandals put an end to his presidency prematurely.
In what no doubt would be "The most dramatic end of a presidency"
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue among observers.
Since 2014, the premium-time audience rates have multiplied by more than two, up to 1.05 million viewers in the CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million in the MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in premium-time hours, an increase of 1.7 million over four years ago according to Nielsen, and the MSNBC program "The Rachel Maddow Show" led the cable channel audience indexes with 3.5 million viewers during the nights when important news took place.
"It's like a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, showrunner of the drama for the ABC "Designed Survivor," which is a secretary of the ministerial cabinet who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another theory.
Remember a taxi trip in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver commented that he was going to vote for Mr Trump.
Why? asked him.
"He said, "Why makes me laugh," Mrs. Scovell said.
There is entertainment within chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the plots that run around Washington can determine the future of the Roe versus Wade case, if the emigrant families can reunite and the state of the world economy.
To disconnect from reality is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
Even so, it means something beyond being an informed citizen to spend six hours watching an expert panel discuss Bob Woodward's use of anonymous sources for his "Fear" book, Paul Manafort's 15,000-dollar ostrich skin bomber jacket ("a garment full of arrogance," said Washington Pos) and the implications of Stormy Daniels' s s scrutinious descriptions of Mr. Trump's anatomy.
I won't look at Super Mario again the same way.
"Part of what makes it look like a reality show is that it's giving you something new every night," commented Brent Montgomery, senior executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", a space that deals with the changes in characters and daily argumental tours of Trump's show (the conflict with N.F.L., the compliments to Kim Jong-un...).

When I got in touch with Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sun and a temperature of 26 degrees out of the house on the north coast of Kauai, but it was locked in the house watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He wasn't able to pull himself apart while Brett Kavanaugh was about to face the Senate Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging on a wire.
"I remember when we were doing all those crazy shows at the time and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

External money comes to lots to fund candidatures to the House for half-legislature elections
It is not surprising that the 17th Congressional District of Pennsylvania is receiving a large flow of money due to the reorganization of a Congressional District with two career representatives to occupy the same position.
This district located outside Pittsburg that was recently reorganized is represented by the Democratic candidate, Conor Lamb, who earned his post in another district in a special election held last spring.
Lamb stands against another representative in office, Republican Keith Rothfus, currently representing the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is largely superimposed on the new 17th district.
The maps were reorganized after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decided in January that the Republicans had manipulated the electoral district of the old districts in their favor.
The electoral career in the new 17th Congressional District triggered a campaign financing festival between the main financial arms of the parties, the Congress's Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after gaining an adjusted victory in the March special election for the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania, which enjoyed broad follow-up.
That post was occupied by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won in the district for 20 points.
Political experts give Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States valued the possibility of penalizing El Salvador for its support to China and then retreated
The diplomats warned that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a pleasant meeting with the president of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017 and even owned a hotel in Panama until his partners launched the Trump Organization management team.
State Department officials decided to order the leaders of the U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama "for recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the department's spokesman in a statement made this month.
However, only the possibility of sanctions against El Salvador, which received approximately $140 million in US aid during 2017, was disputed, including to control drug trafficking, development and economic aid.
The sanctions proposed, including cuts in financial aid and visa restrictions, would be very negative for the Central American country and its high rates of unemployment and murder.
As the internal meetings progressed, US and Central American officials postponed the holding of a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year, which was considered a step forward in efforts to prevent people from emigrating to the United States.
But in mid-September, important management officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to move forward, effectively ending any possibility of applying sanctions to El Salvador.
It's scheduled for Vice President Mike Pence to conduct the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, in a symptom of the importance the administration attaches to it, said the diplomats.
The three American envoys discreetly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new message or harsh punishment from Washington.
A spokesperson for Mr. Bolton's White House declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to talk about the internal deliberations whenever and when the participants remained anonymous.
His accounts were corroborated by an external analyst close to the administration and who also agreed to speak whenever his anonymity was preserved.
Study history
The next negative case could be the report by special adviser Robert Mueller on the case of possible obstruction of Mr Trump's justice, of which currently there is abundant evidence in the public archive.
According to reports, Mr. Mueller is also directing his investigation to discover whether Mr. Trump's campaign conspired with Russia in his attack on our elections.
If Congress changes its hands, Mr. Trump will have to render an account in that body, just when he has to prepare for the elections, and he may finally have to face a popular jury.
They're many incognitoes and I don't want to suggest that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable, as are his European counterparts.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the battle.
In 1938, German officials were determined to give a coup against Hitler if the western front resisted and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of subsequent killings.
The course of history revolves around those points of inflection, and the inexorable advance of democracy is accelerating or shrinking.
The Americans are facing several of these turning points right now.
What are we going to do if Mr Trump fire the Deputy Attorney General of the State, Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been carrying water to his neck since this newspaper reported that last year he suggested secretly recording to the president and speculated that he was unable to hold office.
Mr. Rosenstein said The Times information isn't true.
"How shall we respond if the investigation just requested by the F.B.I. on Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or is not impartial or if its appointment to the Supreme Court is confirmed despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And, above all, will we vote in the half-legislature elections for a Congress that demands Mr Trump's responsibilities?
If we don't pass those tests, democracy will be subjected to a long winter.
But I think we won't fail, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech-loving Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that also occupied my home, which was known from the embassy.
He survived, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to arrest Shabat's candlesticks on that table which included a swastika.
With that inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about the future?"

Rangers Graham Dorrans player is shown to be optimistic about the fight against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers receive the Rapid Vienna on Thursday knowing that a victory against the Austrians, after the impressive draw achieved in Spain in front of the Villareal this month, would place them in a very favorable position to qualify in Group G of the European League.
An injury on the knee prevented the camper Graham Dorans from starting this season up to the 2-2 tie in front of the Villarreal, but he thinks Rangers can use that result as a trampoline to get more important things.
"It was a good point for us, since Villarreal is a good team," declared the 31-year-old player.
"We entered the game believing that we could get something positive and get a point.
We had a chance to win at the end, but in general, the tie is probably a fair result.
They were probably better during the first half, but in the second we were superior.
Next Thursday will be another great European night.
We hope we can achieve all three points, but it'll be hard, because they got a good result in their last game, but with the support of our audience, I'm sure we can fight to achieve a positive result.
Last year was tough between everything that happened with my injuries and changes in the team, but there's an excellent environment right now.
The team is good, the boys are having a good time and the training is good.
We hope we can fight, forget last season and succeed."
Women worry about saving their retirement.
Despite the fact that the survey participants were clear how they wanted to be cared for, few people spoke to their family about the matter.
Approximately half of the participants in this study conducted by Nationwide stated that they commented with their couples on the cost of prolonged care.
Only 10% said they'd talked to their children about it.
"People want you to be looked after by a relative, but they're not taking the necessary steps to have that conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the nationwide life insurance department.
You can start with the next one.
You can't prepare your family to take care of you unless you tell them your wishes in advance.
He collaborates with your advisor and your family to agree on where and how to receive care, since these decisions can be a determining factor in determining the cost.
Call your financial advisor: your advisor might also help you find a way to pay for those expenses.
Prolonged care funding options include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash-value hybrid life insurance policy to help cover these expenses or self-insurance covered with your own funds, whenever you have money.
He negotiates your legal documents: Avoid legal battles.
Get a health care representative to appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical care and make sure professionals meet your wishes in case you're not able to communicate.
It also appreciates the possibility of signing a notary power to manage your finances.
You'll have to choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and make sure that your bills are paid if you're disabled.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that your father or mother has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about her medications and allergies?
Please note in detail that information in a written plan to be prepared.

One man gets several shots with a compressed air rifle at Ilfracombe
A man received multiple shots with a compressed-air rifle as he walked back home after leaving at night.
The victim, about 40 years old, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
The agents described the shooting, which took place at approximately 2:30 a.m. (British summer time) as a "random act".
The victim didn't see the aggressor.
His wounds are not serious and the police are looking for possible witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
A powerful earthquake and tsunami that affected the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to official sources, caused the death of at least 384 people, a figure that is expected to continue to increase.
Due to the cut of communications, rescue bodies could not obtain any information from the regency of Donggala, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 degree magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key data on Palu and Donggala on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Célebes Central, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Célebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency that lies along more than 300 km of coastline to the northwest of the island of Celebes.
This region, an administrative region below a province, had a population of approximately 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy of the Central Célebes province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years by the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit the western part of Donggala in 1996, causing the death of nine people.
Indonesia finds itself on the Pacific high-seismic firebelt, so it suffers from earthquakes regularly.
These are some of the main earthquakes and tsunamis that have suffered in recent years:
2004: An important earthquake on the western coast of Aceh Province of Indonesia, in northern Sumatra, which occurred on December 26, resulted in a tsunami that affected 14 countries, resulting in the death of 226,000 people on the Indian coast, more than half of them, in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes affected the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias in front of the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6.8 degrees magnitude struck the south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that devastated the southern coast, resulting in the death of nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 degrees magnitude near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake of 7.5 degrees magnitude affected the Mentawai Islands, located opposite Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 metres that destroyed dozens of people and caused the death of approximately 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake affected the regiment of Pidie Jaya, located in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, as people remembered the devastation caused by the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
On this occasion, there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died because of the fall of buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes have occurred on the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, which caused the death of more than 500 people, most of them in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily tossed.
Arrest Sarah Palin's eldest son on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin, has been arrested for assault.
Palin, aged 29, wasa natural from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for a crime of domestic violence, for preventing the filing of a complaint for domestic violence and for resistance to authority, according to a note published by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took off his phone.
Palin remains in pre-trial detention at Mat-Su Pretrial Facility with a $500 bond, he reported to the KTU.
He appeared before the trial on Saturday, in which he declared himself "not guilty, of course" when asked, he informed the chain.
Palin faces three minor crimes of type A, which means he could go to prison for up to a year and get a fine of $250,000.
He was also charged with a minor type B crime, punishable by a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges are filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently in the Alaskan War Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic assault, of preventing the filing of a complaint for domestic violence and possession of drunk weapons in connection with the incident.
His bride had accused him of poking a fist on his face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after linking her son's violent behavior with post-traumatic stress disorder after serving with the army in Iraq.
An earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia causes hundreds of deaths
They count at least 384 deaths after the earthquake that affected the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The 7.5 degree magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami to destroy thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not available, and the balance of deaths is expected to increase over the course of the day.
The earthquake took place right in front of Central Celebes, in the north-east of the capital of Indonesia, Iacarta.
Video streams through the partner networks where the impact moment is shown.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a festival on the beach in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors try to apply a few times the death penalty for the suspect of a terrorist attack in New York City
The federal prosecutors in New York are trying to apply the death penalty to Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the New York terrorist attack that caused the death of eight people, a penalty that has not applied in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30-year-old, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bicycle lane on Lower Manhattan West Side Highway, following the life of the pawns and cyclists he found on his way in October.
To justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and caused serious "intentionally" injuries to them, according to the notification of the intention of applying for the death penalty presented in the South District of New York.
Both crimes involve the possibility of applying the death penalty in accordance with the trial document.
Weeks after the attack took place, a federal jury presented to Saipov a charge of 22 crimes, including eight murder crimes in collaboration with an organized crime group, usually used by taxes on organized crime cases, and a crime of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required a "notable planning and premeditation," declared the prosecutors by describing how Saipov carried out the "harrow, cruel, and depraved" attack.
"Sayfullo Habibullaev Saipov has caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," as indicated in the notice of intent to accuse.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
For a decade now, the South District of New York has not been prosecuting a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug traffickers, but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied to a federal case in New York was in 1953, in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a marriage that was executed after being convicted by conspiracy to commit espionage to the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed a lack of repentance during the days and months following the attack according to court documents.
He told the investigators that he felt good about what he had done, as the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that in order to carry out the attack, he was inspired by the videos of the ISIS he displayed on his phone according to the accusation.
He also asked to be able to see the ISIS flag in his hospital room, the police said.
He was found not guilty of the accusation of 22 crimes.
David Patton, one of the federal lawyers responsible for representing Saipov, indicated that they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to ask for the death penalty instead of accepting a conviction with life imprisonment without the possibility of revocation will only prolong the trauma caused by these events for all the people involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecutors not to apply for the death penalty.
A Member of Parliament tory claims that NIGEL FARAGE should be put in front of the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize an army of people" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party stated that politicians had to "feel pressure" on Eurosceptics (when one of Theresa May's own parliamentarians suggested that they should deal with negotiations with the EU.
Regular Member Peter Bone said in front of the Birmingham demonstration that the United Kingdom would 'have already left' the EU if Mr Farage were the secretary of Brexit.
But the challenge faced by Mrs May to reconcile the divided ranks of her party was evidenced by joining the Tories in favour of staying in the EU to an independent protest against Brexit held in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to maintain the commitments of his Chequers plan between the attacks of Brexit supporters, the opposites and the EU.
His allies insisted that he continue to fight to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the negative response, to force Eurosceptics and Labourers to choose between their plan and chaos.
Mr. Bone said at the concentration of the Leave Means Leave Soulihull movement that he wanted to end with the Chequers plan.
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been told to take responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If I had given him the job, we would already be outside the EU right now," he said.
The member of the Wellingborough Parliament added: 'I will continue to defend Brexit, but we must abort the Chequers plan'.
Showing his opposition to the EU, he said: "We do not fight world wars to serve.
We want to make our own laws in our own country".
Mr Bone denied the suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their mind and want to remain in the EU is completely false".
The member of the tories and supporter of Brexit Andrea Jenkyns also went to march, from which he told the reporters: "The only thing I say is: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers plan does not enjoy popularity among public opinion, the opposition will not vote in favour of it, it is unpopular between our party and our activists who, to begin with, are those who occupy the streets and allow us to be chosen.
Cancel the Checkers Plan and start listening".
In a message addressed to Mrs May, she added: “The prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises”.
Mr Farage said at the concentration that it is necessary to make politicians feel " uncomfortable" if they intend to betray the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"Today this is a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit's decision and here we are gathered today to tell them we won't let them get away with it."
In a message addressed to an enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray Brexit's decision, feel uncomfortable.
"We are mobilizing the army of people in this country who gave us the victory in Brexit and who will not rest until we become a proud, independent and autonomous United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, supporters of staying in the EU took a march through Birmingham before holding a two-hour concentration in the city centre.
A few activists waved banners with Tories Against Brexit after the group started this weekend.
Labour Lord Adonis ridiculed the conservatives for the security problems they suffered in an application of the party at the beginning of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems in order and all the best technology for Canada, to have a frontier without friction, to enjoy the free market without frontiers in Ireland," he added.
"It's an absolute farce.
Brexit's concept of good doesn't exist," he added.
Warren plans to think seriously or introduce himself to the presidency
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said he would seriously consider his candidacy for the presidency after the November elections.
Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future on Saturday during a municipal session in a town west of Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will be presented to the re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of the Trump campaign in 2016 in Massachusetts.
It has been focused on speculations that place it as Trump's successor in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with his constituents using the municipality's format since Trump assumed the presidency.
An assistant asked if she was planning to introduce herself to the president.
Warren said this is the time for "women to go to Washington to fix the problems of our government, and for that we need a woman in the presidency."
Arrested related to the deadly shooting of Sims, the player in the LSU
Baton Rouge police, Los Angeles, announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested for the murder of Wayde Sims, the basketball player at LSU on Friday.
Baton Rouge police department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson in a press conference held at 11:00 (Eastern time).
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday asking for help to identify a man who was going out in the pictures.
Yes, 20 years old, he was shot near the Southern University campus in the first hour of Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a bullet wound in his head and finally died as a result of it," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday through 247sports.
Wayde stood up to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being present on the scene with a gun and admitted shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incidents and placed in custody in the East Baton Rouge Parish police department.
Sims, a 2 meter youth who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 matches with 10 headlines last season and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton comes to the world title thanks to team orders, which allowed him to win the victory over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas classified himself in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes' team orders would be decisive in the race.
Bottas, who was leaving from the pole, had a good way out and almost left Hamilton alone while defending his position during the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went into boxes first and let Hamilton run with traffic on the back of the group, something that would be decisive.
The Mercedes stopped in boxings a later time and went out behind Vettel, but Hamilton stepped forward after several wheeled maneuvers which caused Ferrari's driver to give up reluctantly on the inside the risk of being delayed after a double defensive maneuver on the third curve.
Max Verstappen left from the last row of the exit grid and climbed up to seventh square at the end of the first round on the day of his 21st anniversary.
Then he led the race during a large part of this thanks to which he retained his tires to get to go faster at the end and advance to Kimi Raikkonen by the fourth position.
He finally went into boxes around 44 but couldn't advance any positions in the last eight laps, which ended with Raikkonen in fourth place.
It was a difficult day, because Valtteri did an excellent job all weekend and was a real gentleman.
The team did an extraordinary job to get the first two squares," said Hamilton.
An improper body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein in an event celebrated on Saturday for his insistence that he had not leaked Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court of sexual abuse.
In a speech given in an act in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly of Ford's testimony to the Senate's Judicial Committee and remarked instead that what was happening in the Senate proved that people were "miserable, repulsive and lying".
"The only thing that could happen and the most beautiful that is happening in the last days in the Senate, when you see indignation, when you see that people who are angry and miserable, repulsive and lying," he said.
"When you see these publications and leaks and they say, "Oh, I didn't go.
I didn't go."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you do any filtration?
Remember his answer... did you filter the document?: "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't go.
Wait a minute.
Did we filter it?...No.," she added by imitating the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh made by Ford in July and filtered in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't filter his story," Feinstein told the committee as reported in The Hill newspaper.
"I ask you to keep your privacy and do what you asked of me."
But his denial did not seem to sit well with the president, who commented the following during the Saturday night act: "I tell you that body language was not the right one.
He may not have leaked it, but he used the worst body language I've ever seen in my life."
Continuing his defense of the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was accused of improper sexual conduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power by any means necessary.
They are wicked and repulsive, they don't care who they hurt, they have to run over to regain power and control," said the president, mediate.

An air traffic controller dies to make sure hundreds of passengers from an aircraft can escape an earthquake
An air controller from Indonesia considered a hero after dying to make sure a plane loaded with hundreds of passengers could safely take off.
The balance of dead people is 800 and there are many missing after a great earthquake shook the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong replicas continue to feel in the area and there are many people who are trapped under the cracks of the city of Palu.
Although his fellow workers fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan grande refused to leave his post at the control tower at the airport Mutiara Sis Al Jufri de Palu who was swinging violently.
He stayed in his post to make sure that Batik Air's 6321 flight, which was on the runway at that time, could take off safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought he was going to fall.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesian spokesperson Yohannes Siriat stated that this decision may have allowed hundreds of lives to be saved, reported the ABC News channel from Australia.
We've prepared a Balykpapan helicopter in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
"Breath our hearts when we hear," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the death balance may be thousands and the country's disaster management agency has stated that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The victim balance is believed to continue to increase due to the fact that there are many bodies under the rubble and many of them could not be reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency's spokesman.
Waves up to six meters devastated Palu, where a massive burial will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial planes are transporting help and live.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said to Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance is bringing bodies.
Drinking water is scarce.
People are looting the miniarchies».
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Cross Indonesia is struggling to help the survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could become much worse."
Indonesia's president, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready?" he informed CNN.
Indonesia suffered earlier this year earthquakes in Lombok where more than 550 people died.
Aircraft accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now claims that there is a missing person after a plane crash in a lagoon
The airline that operates a flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now claims that there is a missing one after previously asserting that the 47 passengers and crew had left without incident the plane that was sinking.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they were unable to locate a passenger.
The airline reported that it was working together with the authorities, hospitals and local investigators to try to locate this man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more detailed information on the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Ships from the area helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crash against the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
The authorities stated on Friday that seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturdays and everyone was stable.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy confirmed that the plane landed in the lagoon before reaching the runway.
Some witnesses claim that the plane passed by the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American national passenger, commented that he entered very little height.
"That's something extremely positive," Jaynes remarked.
Jaynes said that both he and other passengers managed to advance between the water that reached their waists to the emergency exits of the plane that was sinking.
He also remembered that the flight attendants were screaming and scared, and that he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy indicated that sailors who were working near the site on the improvement tasks of a dock also helped rescue by using an inflatable boat to move people to the coast before the plane sank about 30 meters.
According to Aviation Safety Network data, 111 people died in airline accidents registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none of them affected Air Niugini.
An analyst composes the chronology of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecution referred to the evidence on Saturday at the retrial of a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in intelligence analysis.
During the trial he described to the jury how he used the records of a mobile phone to recompose the movements of the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19th victim Jessica Chambers on the night of his death.
Rowlett stated that he received data from the location of several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was meeting with Chambers the night of his death contradicting his earlier claims as reported in The Clarion Ledger's newspaper.
When this data showed that his mobile phone was meeting Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went up to the stage on Saturday and testified that he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when she said she was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford said she was "lie because my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradiction consisted of Tellis claiming that he had known Chambers since about two weeks ago when he died.
Mobile phone records indicated they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett declared that shortly after the death of Chambers, Tellis removed Chambers' messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"Borrone of her life," said Hale.
It's scheduled for the defense to begin its final allegations on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped that the trial would be brought to trial by the jury that same day.

They want to go back to their roots and get the fighting hip hop back to popular.
Artists like The Fugees and Common recently experienced a resurgence in the United Kingdom through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another nigger?!
A New York Child Caregiver demands a couple after a "racist" message
A New York Child Caregiver will sue a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a message that she would not have addressed to her from the mother who complained that she was "another black".
The couple denies being racist and compares the demand with "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, showed her anguish to discover that the babysitter Giselle Maurice was black when she presented her first day of work in 2016.
"Nooooooooon, other black," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a message.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After realizing her mistake, a "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, claiming that the nurse who had just left, who was African-American, had done her job wrong and expected a Filipino according to the announcement from the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice was paid on the day of work and sent home to a Uber.
Now Maurice is going to sue the couple for compensation for dismissal and requires compensation of $350 a day for the six months of internal work for which they were initially hired even though there was no average contract.
"Look, I want to show you that these things don't happen," he declared to the Post on Friday, adding later "It's a case of discrimination."
The couple responded to the accusations of racism by claiming that firing Maurice was the most reasonable thing, because they were afraid they couldn't trust her after they offended her.
"My wife had sent him a message I didn't intend to send him.
He's not racist.
We're not racist," declared husband Joel Plasco to the Post.
"But would they leave their children in the hands of a person they offended, even if it had been due to a mistake?
Your baby just born?
Come on!
After comparing the demand with "extortion," Plasco said that his wife had just had a baby two months ago and that she was in a "very difficult situation."
"Are they going for such a person?
That's not very ethical," added the investment banker.
As the legal process continues, the public opinion court quickly denounced the couple on social networks, attacking them for their behavior and applied logic.
Paddington editors feared that readers would not identify themselves with a talking bear as it can be concluded in a new letter
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, commented on the letter: "It's hard to get into the skin of a person who reads it for the first time before it was published.
It's really fun to know now what we know about Paddington's huge success."
After stating that his father, who had worked as a camera for the BBC before being inspired to write the children's book on a small toy bear, would be optimistic about his refusal to work, he added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "aggressive" after his death last year.
From Paddington, to whom he describes as a "very important member of our family," he added that his father was discreetly proud of the success he finally achieved.
"He was a quiet man and nothing presumptuous," he said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if you had a son who gets something: you're proud though you didn't really do it yourself.
I think I felt Paddington's success a little that way.
Though it was a creation of his own and product of his imagination, he always gave all the credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye through the phone
After the landing, his daughter was quickly taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where the doctors worked without success to save his life.
"Nothing called regularly to say that it was too bad, that it was not expected to survive.
"Then I received Nad's call to tell me she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, my love.
I'll meet you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs the doctors gave him to keep his heart beating were slowly consuming and leaving his body.
He had already died a while before, and now he was shutting down.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing it was happening.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I had to take it."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Lapered, at that time of mourning for the loss of her daughter, entered the plane along with the other passengers, without noticing the ordeal she was suffering.
"No one has detected him," he said.
"He had a low head and tears fell on me all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight when I felt this awesome feeling of solidarity for Nad.
That I needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved her."
Posters of distressed women to avoid suicide on a bridge
Two women who lost loved ones because of suicide are working to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting cards on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers to which you can call for help.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, was 13 when he started to suffer from depression, and he committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want no father to feel how I have to feel every day," he said.
45-year-old Mrs Davis living in Lydney commented that her son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said their smile lit up any room."
However, he left his job before he died and was "in a very deep depression."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs Davis commented, "I have a continuing concern that there is a side effect."
Mrs. Davis created the cards' to inform people that there are people you can talk to and talk to, even if he's a friend.
Don't be silent, you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after her mother's death.
"He didn't comment that he was sad or depressed or anything like it," he remarked.
"A couple days before Christmas, we detected a change in his attitude.
Christmas Day hit the bottom (when the children opened their presents, he made no visual contact with them or nothing)."
He said that his death was a huge trauma to them, but they must overcome him: "He torn the family apart.
He threw us out.
But we have to keep going and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs from a thread while the FBI initiates the investigation
"I thought, if we could get something like what I was asking for (a limited time research and limited scope), we might get a little unity," commented Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "scraping" because of the paralyzing of the supporters.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican sympathizers want the FBI to conduct the investigation?
Your reluctance is due to a matter of deadlines.
Five weeks left for half-legislature elections (November 6th). If, as expected, Republicans get bad results, they will be severely weakened in their attempts to get the man they want to be elected to the country's highest court.
George W. Bush was calling senators, exerting pressure to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush, thanks to which he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen when the FBI carries out its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, currently occupying 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's still unclear if Mr. Kavanaugh can reach at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break the tie and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
The number of deserters in North Korea falls under Kim's mandate
The number of deserters in North Korea to South Korea has been reduced from Kim Jong One's access to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean law enforcement officer.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea's Ministry of Unification, said there were 1,127 desertions in the past year, away from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China and the increase in tariffs charged by people in charge of crossing people across the border were key factors.
Pyongyang made no public comments.
The vast majority of deserters in the North were finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul declares that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run through China, which has the largest border crossing with North Korea and which is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized area between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often repatriate them.
The relationship between the north and the south (which technically continue to be at war) has improved markedly over the last few months.
This same month, the leaders of the two countries gathered in Pyongyang to hold talks focused on negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons that were parked.
This took place after the historic June meeting between the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and Kim Jong-un held in Singapore, where they agreed to work very hard to eliminate nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the sanctions imposed by the United States for the lack of progress since then.
"If we don't trust the United States, we won't be able to trust our national security, and in those circumstances there is no possibility that we will be unilaterally disarmed first," said Mr. Ri in a speech delivered in front of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "historical" and claims it's inappropriate to access the Supreme Court
The leader of the minority in the House, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate for the "historical" Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court and assured that he was not suitable by his nature for access to the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview held on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Austin Festival, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman were ever to behave like that, they would call it hysterical," declared Pelossi about his reaction to Kavanaugh's statement to the Senate Judicial Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations of sexual abuse of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During the initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, on occasion almost shouting and talking while describing his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Committee's Democrats, categorizing the charges against him as a "murder of the grotesque and coordinated reputation" organized by liberals outraged by the defeat of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential elections.
So he said he believed that Kavanaugh's statement showed that he could not access the Supreme Court because he demonstrated that he had prejudices against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats," he said.
So he objected when he was asked whether he would try to challenge Kavanaugh if it's confirmed in the post and if the Democrats get the majority in the House of Representatives.
"What I have to say is this: if you're not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then it's inappropriate to be not only in the Supreme Court, but in the court you're currently in," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Washington D.C. Appeals Circuit Court.
So he added that, as a Democrat, he was concerned about the possible resolutions that Kavanaugh might adopt against the law of protection to the patient and care for accessible health or the Roe case against Wade, since he is considered a conservative judge.
In view of the confirmation, Kavanaugh escaped questions about the annulment of certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not the time for a hysterical and prejudiced person to access the court and still above us to say, look how well!" said Pelosi.
And women need to exercise it.
It's a justified diaphragm, months and years of rage overflowing, and you can't expel it without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Mrs Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's that weird, do I?"
He continued, "I got a lot of help from a woman who was an executive somewhere, who said she was also crying when she got angry, but who developed a technique that consisted of that, when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, "You're probably thinking I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And then he went on.
I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are allowed as a partial escape valve for anger because they are essentially not understood.
One of my sharpest memories of one of my first jobs in an office dominated by men, in which I began to cry with an impossible anger to describe, was that an older woman grabbed me from behind her neck, a distant superior who had always provoked me a slight fear, and led me to the gap of the ladder.
"Never let them see you crying," he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll comfort you if they come to you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a democratic congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidatures.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an out-of-married adventure on a ship named Monkey Business and was withdrawn from the presidential career, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought there was no reason why she could not consider presenting herself to the presidency.
"It wasn't a well thought-out decision," I remarked in laughter 30 years later.
"There were already seven candidates in the race and the last one they needed was another one.
Someone called it "Brancaneves and the seven dwarfs."
Because the campaign was advanced, it was delayed in fundraising, so he swore he wouldn't enter the presidency unless he could raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
He found that some of those who supported her contributed $1,000 to the male candidates would only provide $250.
"What do you think, that I have a discount?" she wondered.
When he made his speech to announce that he would not present a formal campaign, he was overcome by the emotions (thanks to the people who supported him, frustration with the system that made it difficult to raise money and address the voters instead of the delegates and angered by existing sexism) that remained speechless.
"You'd think I'd suffered a nervous crisis," Mrs. Schroeder recalled about how the press reacted to it.
"You'd think Kleinex was my sponsoring company.
I remember thinking, what are you going to write on my tombstone?
"Did you cry?"
How the US-China Trade War for Beijing Can Be Positive
The initial bombings of the trade war between the United States and China were deafening and, despite the fact that the war is far from over, a gap between the countries can be beneficial for Beijing in the long run, the experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, launched the first warning earlier this year by recording key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation took place this week with the application of new tariffs that affect an equivalent of $200 billion, recording half of the items coming to the United States from China.
Beijing counter-attacked again and again, the most recent raising the rates from five to ten percent to $60,000 million in American products.
China has promised to imitate American measures and it seems unlikely that the world's second largest economy will be immuting in the short term.
To get Washington to step back, it would be necessary to give in to their demands, but to bow publicly to the United States would be much more shameful for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Still, experts say that if Beijing knows how to play its letters correctly, the pressures of trade war with the United States could favour China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the necessary conditions for starting an economic crisis in both countries is actually much more dangerous than previously recognized," said Abigail Grace, an Asian-centered researcher at the Center for New American Security, a study center.
Syria is "ready" for refugees to return, says the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria claims it's ready for the voluntary return of the refugees and is asking for help in rebuilding the country devastated by a war of more than seven years.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem declared that the conditions of the country are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is much more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
Now all the necessary conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people are still living in the country and need humanitarian aid.

But he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe wins victory at Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won Ryder Cup 2018 defeating the US team for a final score from 16.5 to 10.5 at the Le Golf National club located outside Paris, France.
It's the sixth consecutive defeat of the United States in European territory and it has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe recovered the crown when the Danish captain's team Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points needed to hit the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who was the one who fought most during the tournament, sent the ball to the water in the hole 16 pair 3, losing his match against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer has shined in all his series, becoming one of the only four players who have achieved a 5-0-0 since the current tournament format was implemented in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5&4 by the player with the worst ranking of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen, from Denmark.
The first ranking in the world's ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2&1 against the English Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran with eight Ryder Cups played, Spanish Sergio García became the European player with more tournament wins, with 25.5 points.
"I don't often cry, but today I can't help it.
It was a hard year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to be able to get my drink back.
The important thing is the team, and I'm glad I could help," said a excited Garcia after the European victory.
He passed the witness to his compatriot John Ram, who managed to defeat the American legend of Tiger Woods golf by 2&1 in the individual game of Sunday.
"It's amazing how proud I feel today for being able to defeat Tiger Woods. I grew up to play that boy," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost his four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 at the Ryder Cup.
It's a strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, a 14-year-old winner, located just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had problems all weekend not to get out of the streets, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finanu, who played a high-caliber golf course throughout the tournament.
Captain of the United States, Jim Furyk, said after his team's frustrating performance, "I'm proud of these boys, they fought.
This morning, for a moment, they put the Europeans into trouble.
We fought.
I'll take my hat off to Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
His 12 players played very well.
We'll reorganise, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll move on.
I want these 12 boys and I'm proud to be a captain.
It's to take out the hat.
They were superior."
