Former head of the Brazilian presidential cabinet is brought before the court
On Tuesday, a federal judge accepted the charges brought against the former head of the Brazilian presidential cabinet for its alleged involvement in a massive corruption scheme on Petrobras state oil company.
The federal prosecutor's office said Jose Dirceu would be sued for allegations of corruption, deception and money laundering this month.
Fourteen other persons will be tried, including Joao Vaccari Neto, former treasurer of the Workers' Party in Brazil, and Renato de Souza Duque, former president of the Petrobras business services.
Dirceu is the oldest member of the ruling Workers Party taken in custody for connections to this scheme.
Dirceu served as chief of the former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva between 2003 and 2005.
He was arrested early August at home, where he was already under house arrest, with an 11-year sentence for involvement in a voting scheme in Congress over 10 years ago.
The prosecutors said Dirceu developed the Petrobras bribe-taking scheme, accepted bribes while in operation and continued to receive payments from entrepreneurs after it was closed at the end of 2013 for the scandal of the votes purchased.
According to prosecutors, the Petrobras scheme involved approximately $2 billion in bribe and other illegal funds.
Part of that money would have returned to the campaign fund of the ruling party and their allies.
It would also include bribes to Petrobras directors in exchange for inflated contracts.
‘miraculous’ recovery of a surviving student from the Peshawar massacre
A child paralyzed after being shot four times in Pakistan's worst terrorist attack succeeded in a "miraculous" recovery after following treatment in the United Kingdom.
Mohamed Ibrahim Khan, 13-year-old, the doctors in Pakistan had told him he'd never be able to go again.
At least 140 people, most children, were killed when armed men attacked the public school of the Peshawar army last December.
Mohamed, who arrived in London last month for the operation, will be discharged later from the hospital.
Just nine months ago, an ordinary morning on Tuesday, Mohamed sat at first aid and listened carefully to his teachers.
Even then, seven armed men disguised in uniforms of security officers entered public military school.
They wore belts with explosives and had a simple mission to accomplish: to kill all men, women and children out of the way.
"I can't forget what happened that day," Mohamed says with a rough look.
I was sitting in the amphitheater, asking questions... then I heard gunshots out.
The terrorists went inside and started killing. Our teacher was burned alive.
Mohamed describes how he pulled four students out of the amphitheater as the carnage unfolds.
Then he says he heard his friend, Hamza, yelling at him.
He said "oh, brother, save me."
I held him by the hand.
Then I was shot in the back, and he in the head.
Most of the people killed in the attack were students
Hamza died in Mohamed's arms.
Mohamed remembers that immediately after that he passed out and that the next thing he knew was that he was on a hospital bed paralyzed from the brass down.
The doctors in Peshawar in northern Pakistan, then the doctors in Rawalpindi, near the capital, told his family that there was no treatment and that he would never be able to go.
"When I saw him, I felt how my soul came out," says Sher Khan, Mohamed's father.
Those nine months were the hardest of my life.
But Khan and his wife, Sherbano, refused to believe that their son so passionate about cricket would never be able to use his feet again.
They campaigned and called for help from Pakistani television, attracting support from famous people like Imran Khan, a cricket player who became a politician.
In the end, they managed to raise funds to take Mohamed to the United Kingdom and provide treatment at the Harley Street private clinic in London.
The neurosurgeon Irfan Malik described Mohamed as "fearing" when he arrived at the hospital.
“He had spent the last [a few] months lying in bed without being able to move on one side,” Malik says.
He was weak, he had put a lot of pressure on his back.
He wasn't in a very good shape.
A vertebrae at the base of Mohamed's spine had been destroyed
Mohamed had been shot in the shoulder, hip and back during the attack, and his lower spine had been destroyed, leading to paralysis.
However, during a six-hour operation, Malik and his team were able to rewire the nerve endings and rebuild the destroyed part of the column.
Even Malik was surprised by what happened next.
Just a week after the operation, Mohamed stood up and started to step in and walk.
We weren't expecting such a good result.
It was a miracle," he says.
Within two weeks of the operation, Mohamed is ready to leave the hospital and start the long recovery process.
Mohamed challenged fate and began to go again
He wants to become strong and continue his studies in the United Kingdom.
However, it is determined to return to Pakistan, join the army and fight terrorism.
"I feel like I still have a chance to live," he says, showing the weapons images drawn by him next to school textbooks and pens
Physically, Mohamed gets stronger every day, but the psychological trauma he passes through and now is unimaginable.
"My fury hasn't dropped," he confesses.
In my school were little children killed.
What crime did they commit?
His mother wipes out a tear, comforts the child, and says: “I see my son going again. ”
He'll be able to continue his life naturally.
The “Super Voice” 4G service from Three provides better signal
Three uses a 4G spectrum with a lower frequency, which can cover a wider area
The Three Mobile Phone Provider launched a service in the United Kingdom that says it will improve the reception inside buildings and in rural areas without signal.
The 4G Super Voice service allows customers to make calls and send text messages using a spectrum with a lower frequency.
Other networks intend to introduce the same technology, known as "Voice Over Long-Term Evolution (VolTE)".
This currently only works with Samsung Galaxy S5, but recent iPhone phones will benefit from it in the following months.
Three mentions that up to 5.5 million customers will have access to the service by 2017.
Chief Technology Officer Bryn Jones said: “By the end of the year, one million of our customers will have access to a better indoor coverage and will be able to use their phones in many places as they have been before.”
The sights are preparing for the pantomime season
The pantomime season is very important for theatres throughout the United Kingdom, many of which are now preparing for this year's season.
Now, at the Christmas theater, some of the biggest names in the showbusiness are taking part.
Matthew Kelly and Hayley Mills will appear in Cinderella - first in the role of one of the evil sisters, and second in the role of the fairy.
They reveal the secrets of their pantomime at BBC Breakfast.
Steven Wilson: "If I do nothing, I feel guilty"
Steven Wilson was recently designated as the great winner of Progressive Music Awards
Steven Wilson has often been called the most active musician in the progressive rock world.
The musical talent won three awards at Progressive Music Awards, which took place this month in London, including the award for the best album of the year for Hand.
In his five-star review, The Guardian called the album "an intelligent, expressive and exciting artwork".
Since the 1980s, Wilson has been the engine of several musical projects, the most known being the Porcupine Tree rock band.
Now, before two house shows closed at Royal Albert Hall, Wilson launches a double LP only in vinyl format, Transience, to show the "more accessible" side of his solo activity.
He told BBC about his love for vinyls and his charged program and explained how the comedy actor Matt Berry came to open his shows.
What does vinyl mean to you?
I grew up right at the end of the vinyl era and I remember that then I was just waiting for the CD to appear, because the vinyl was so annoying.
You bought a record, you went with him home, had a scratch and you had to bring him back.
I love CDs, and for certain types of music, for example the classic one, they're better than vinyls.
But the problem with CDs and digital downloads is that there is nothing left to truly value.
Having a vinyl is like having a nice painting stuck in the living room.
It's something you can hold in your hand, while you get absorbed in the lyrics and overwhelmed by the artistic act.
I thought it was just a nostalgic thing, but it doesn't have to be like that if some kids are too young to remember vinyls like this kind of experience.
Do you have any vinyl you especially hold?
I admit I got rid of all the vinyls in the '90s.
All the vinyls I have are bought again.
I started from the idea of remaking the collection I was 15 years old, but I went beyond that limit.
The first disc I convinced my parents to buy me was Out of the Blue from the Electric Light Orchestra.
If I still had the original copy, it would have had sentimental value, but unfortunately it is somewhere through a charity store.
Steven Wilson hopes the album will be a gateway to possible new fans
Why did you launch your new Transience compilation on vinyl?
This was originally conceived as an idea for the day of the record stores, but I missed the opportunity.
My house of suggestive albums to gather some of my shorter and more accessible songs.
I became easily obsessed with the idea of doing something like "introduction into Steven Wilson's music" and I had to keep the project being launched only on vinyl.
Whoever buys the vinyl also receives a downloaded variant to high resolution.
Are you worried that the album won't show your music in its true light?
No, because, although I'm focusing on longer music, there's one thing I've always appreciated above all else: the melody part.
There is a lot of progressive rock that focuses more on technical complexity than on the melodic side.
Pink Floyd, the most famous progressive rock band of all time, passed the test due to the fact that they always put the emphasis on the melody and the atmosphere.
What are you preparing for the Albert Hall shows?
I don't want you to reveal too much.
The repertoire will be completely different in each of the nights.
In the first, there will be a version of the Hand show. Erase. which I had this year, but on steroids, with a few guests.
The second night will rather be an incursion into my history, being directed more towards fans who have been following me over the years.
How did you choose Matt Berry to open your show the second night?
And me and the others in the tournament team are great fans of [the comedy series on Channel 4] Toast of London, to the point where we always quote from him.
I thought I'd listen to Matt's music, so I bought his album, Music for Insomniacs.
I talked to him about our common love for Mike Oldfield and asked him to sing at the Royal Albert Hall.
Seems to me I'm extremely lucky to have him in the open.
You remixed albums of such bands as XTC, Tears for Fears and Yes.
How much does this affect your own music?
I am not consciously inspired by this, but, inevitably, when you deconstruct these classic albums, they keep you in mind.
My last solo album, The Raven That Refused to Sing, was undoubtedly the most progressive old school album I ever created.
I don't think it was a coincidence that I remixed King Crimson, Jethro Tull and Yes almost all the year before.
The current album, Hand. Erase., is much more open, because I worked at Tears for Fears and XTC.
You are often described as the busiest progressive rock musician.
Is that how you feel?
You can remove the word progressive.
I think I'm probably one of the most obsessed people in today's music world and I don't say that proudly, because please believe me, it's a curse.
I think I inherited this from my father, who has an incredibly strong work ethic.
If I don't do anything all day, I'm starting to feel guilty.
That's why remix work was a gift, because it means I don't have to do my music all the time.
The music industry is a tough place to make a career.
Now I wouldn't recommend this to anyone as a profession.
I work every day and I'm not rich, but I live well.
I love what I'm doing, it's a privilege, but if I was lazy, I don't think I'd have survived.
Transition will be launched in the United Kingdom on September 25.
Steven Wilson will sing at the Royal Albert Hall on September 28 and 29, as part of his 2015-2016 European tour.
A new contract brings back jobs to Skytrans
The new Skytrans hired a part of the airline staff who had lost their job when the old Skytrans went bankrupt.
Skytrans, the refurbished company in northern Queensland, has awarded a $25 million contract to transport employees to the QGC natural gas company, which meant that 18 crew members recovered their job.
Skytrans, company owned by the Wild family, became very active in January, after the Newman government rewarded the subsidised routes that formed a large part of the airline's business.
The bankruptcy caused several communities to face a potential isolation, and Warren Entsch, a federal-liberal parliamentary national-liberal for Northern Queensland, was the representative voice of the critics of the national-liberal government.
Another company, Collings Aircraft Holdings, relaunched the Skytrans brand in March.
Michael Thinee, Executive Director of Skytrans, said that the QCG airline contract has already created jobs.
"We have managed to reassign 18 Skytrans staff members with a full term, as pilots and crew members," he said.
We are also pleased to have a new staff, with direct logistical experience in managing flight operations for QGC customers.
In just five months, we married 100% of the workforce, 78 staff being employed in Cairns and now in Brisbane.
The contract seeks Skytrans to extend its flight operations from its central headquarters in Cairns, which serves Cape York and Strait Torres, and also to include a base in Brisbane.
Skytrans will operate 18 return flights per week for QGC staff and entrepreneurs from Brisbane to locations in Chinchilla and Taroom, in its 36-seat Dash-8 aircraft, starting on Monday, 26 October.
Tony Nunan, Executive Director of QGC, said Skytrans received the contract following an invitation to tender.
"We are delighted that this contract will contribute to the expansion of a company in Queensland," he said.
The Skytrans contract maintains its high-quality and consistent flight services to support our operations and projects.
Liberal Parliamentarian and fresh Mother Kelly O'Dwyer is advised to make a greater supply of milk to avoid missing votes in the Chamber
Looks like more women will be part of the cabinet.
Malcolm Turnbull's new government will be invested on Monday and there are strong signals that more women will take over the portfolios.
One of the government's rising stars, Kelly O'Dwyer, was advised to make a greater supply of milk for her newborn to prevent breastfeeding from intervening in her duties in Parliament.
The advice comes from the government disciplinary officer Scott Buchholz, who subsequently consulted his Labour counterpart to find out which is the most appropriate approach for a breastfeeding parliamentarian, according to the orders in force.
Liberal MP Kelly O'Dwyer with her daughter, Olivia.
In accordance with current orders - the set of rules governing the behaviour of parliamentarians in the Chamber - breastfeeding mothers obtain voting powers in Parliament.
That means that their vote is considered valid even when they are not present in the Chamber.
But Whip did not know about this exemption before consulting with opposition discipline manager Chris Hayes on this issue.
Things rushed on two occasions when O'Dwyer could not attend a division meeting and could not fulfill his obligation to hold a speech because he had just begun breastfeeding.
On one of these occasions, her team was asked whether the parliamentarian was planning to make a bigger milk supply instead of breast-feeding.
Scott Buchholz, a parliamentary from Queensland, is responsible for the government's discipline.
Afterwards, the two solved their dispute.
Both refused to comment when contacted by Fairfax Media, but separate sources from Buchholz and O'Dwyer said for Fairfax Media that the representative of the Higgins division was furious when he was told to make a higher supply of milk instead of breastfeeding his daughter, Olivia, born in May.
This is revealed even when new Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is working on the design of his new cabinet.
Buchholz, a liberal national parliamentary from Queensland, was promoted as a disciplinarian by former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, as part of the negative effect of the February-year census motion.
O'Dwyer, in a picture with Amanda Rishworth from the Labour Party and her son Percy, is one of the three mothers in Parliament.
The former discipline manager, Phillip Ruddock, was removed only a few days after Abbott faced a motion of censorship by which he wanted to eliminate his function, being replaced by Buchholz.
Another supporter of Abbott, Andrew Nickolic, liberal of Tasmania, was also promoted and appointed responsible for deputy discipline.
Nickolic had recently kept the front page of the newspapers, after he had discovered that he had sent Turnbull a message asking him to give up contesting Abbott's leadership.
In August, O'Dwyer returned to Parliament for the first time after the birth of her daughter, Olivia, in May.
It's one of the three parliamentarians who have become moms this year.
Labour Party spokesman Catherine King said on Wednesday that the voting power for breastfeeding mothers was introduced when her son was a baby.
"Now she's [seven years old]," she wrote on Twitter.
The discipline manager should have known.
O'Dwyer was promoted in the cabinet at the end of last year and can be promoted under Turnbull, who said on Wednesday that he wants more women in his office.
"No one wants more than I can see more women depending on power, influence, in Parliament, in the ministry, in the whole country," the Prime Minister said in front of reporters in Parliament.
Abbott included a single woman in his first cabinet and, following pressure to increase female representation in the Coalition, promoted a second woman in the cabinet after the December remand.
Five things the business environment wants from Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull
Malcolm Turnbull: How will the markets react?
Mal Maiden, an editor at BusinessDay, examines the impact Malcolm Turnbull may have on Australia's business sector.
Tuesday, lobby groups in the business sector did not know how to manifest their greater enthusiasm when Malcolm Turnbull took over the country's ranks as prime minister.
The main reason is that a large part of what many of them would have wanted to see had been abandoned under Tony Abbott's leadership.
Or he had just ended up in a negotiated suspension due to Abbott's "crash-or-crash-through" political style.
Representatives of interest groups spoke at unison about their hope in Turnbull's ability to satisfy public interest, reach political agreement and do things well.
So what exactly does the country's largest companies and their representatives expect from our new prime minister?
ChAFTA will be a first test of Turnbull's ability to overcome negative advertising.
Turnbull itself set the free trade agreement with China as the initial objective.
In his first speech in which he mediated that challenge, the Free Trade Agreement between China and Australia (ChAFTA) represented the central point of his attack on Labour leader Bill Shorten.
In a speech in August, Turnbull criticized the "revolutionary economic shocks" of the Labour Party on that problem and expressed concern about the racist temptation of critics.
“In the context of ChAFTA, winners are, numerically, much more than losers,” he said in the same speech.
The business environment hopes he will win this debate.
Don Argus, the legendary representative of the business environment, stressed that this is an essential point, being supported, among others, by the Australian Business Council (which represents the largest 100 companies in the country) and by James Packer, the billionaire in the gaming industry.
The business environment wishes to conclude this agreement, and it will be a first test for Turnbull's ability to overcome negative advertising and negotiate with the whole Senate.
Minister for Small Business, Bruce Billson, supports the Harper Analysis recommendations.
This could lead from the beginning to certain differences with the business environment.
The impact assessment shall apply in the case of large mergers and other contracts in order to decide whether consumers will suffer due to lack of competition.
It is called "effect assessment" because it takes into account not only the actions and intentions of the company but also the effect they will have on competition and the market.
The way in which this assessment is drawn up is extremely important for the outcome.
Harper's analysis of the competition law recommends a change in the assessment of effects, which will make it more difficult for large corporations to remove smaller operators from the market.
The government led by Tony Abbott was on the Australian Affairs Council and major retailers.
Turnbull now makes it clear that he wants the entire cabinet to think about what he's going to do next.
CAA jumped to burn to state that if Turnbull follows Harper's analysis recommendations, consumers will need to pay higher prices.
It is ironic that the whole business environment is the one who advised the new Prime Minister to have greater respect for cabinet processes, which Turnbull seems to do and by that he let Bruce Billson, the Minister for Small Business (which is on Harper's recommendation) support his arguments in front of his colleagues.
Mediterranean diet could contribute to the prevention of breast cancer
Spanish researchers followed women aged between 60 and 80 years.
Those who mainly eat olive plants, fish and oil have reduced their “significant” probability of breast cancer.
Terrence Howard puts the multiplication table under the sign of the question
Terrence Howard is of the opinion that I fully misunderstood the arithmetic.
The negative character in the Empire told Rolling Stone magazine that he doesn't think one times one is equal to one.
"How is it equal to one?" he said.
If one times one does one, it means two doesn't have value, because one time he doesn't have effect himself.
One times one do two, because the fourth square root of his four is two - so what is the fourth square root of his two?
There should be one, but we're told there's two, and that's impossible.
Terrence, we don't really understand what you mean.
Not surprisingly, Howard's teachers disagreed with his theory, so he gave up at Pratt Institute, where he studied chemical engineering.
"I mean you can't close your eyes when you know something's wrong," he explained.
Howard found for his parallel approach to mathematics called "Terryology".
The actor confesses that he spends his time cutting and reassembling scissors, wires, magnets and plastic sheets to illustrate his theory "one times one" and other similar theories of his.
He said for the magazine that he and his ex-wife, Mira Pak, spent up to 17 hours a day creating these illustrations.
The Rolling Stone editor described Howard's creations as "more complex, two-dimensional and three-dimensional infinite-form bricks linked with copper wire or magnetized wire".
Howard says, among other things, that he hopes to receive the U.S. patent 20150079872 A1 ("Systems and methods for improved building brick applications").
Also, the actor in "In the footsteps of an idol" also says that Pythagora Einstein and Tesla would "crazy" if they saw Terryology.
"You know," he says, "I've been wondering since I was three-four years old why does a bubble take round shape?"
Why doesn't it become a triangle or a square?
I understand why.
Howard added that he hopes to change the course of education.
“This will be the last century when our children will learn that one or one will make one,” he said.
There will no longer be need to grow in ignorance.
In twenty years now, they'll know that one times one do two.
We're about to reveal a new truth.
True universal mathematics.
We'll check in about 20 years.
Ariana Grande imitates Britney Spears at Wheel of Impression
Tuesday, during the show "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon", Ariana Grande perfectly imitated Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera.
The 22-year-old pop star played little at Fallon's Wheel of Impression, playing "Mary Had a Little Lamb" as Spears, then displaying his vocal qualities with the song "The Wheels on the Bus" sung with Aguilera's voice.
In turn, Fallon did a good job imitating Sting and Aaron Neville.
The two also interpreted versions of The Weeknd's "I Can't Feel My Face".
This week, Grand's name has been appearing in the press.
On the same day it was also at Good Morning America, where it opened the show with the incident of the doughnut linen.
Taco Bell hopes that the restaurants "Cantina" in which it will be served will become points of urban interest
Would you like to spend an elegant evening in town?
Taco Bell is an option.
On September 22, the Mexican-style fast food restaurant chain will open a new location in the Wicker Park area of Chicago, offering a tapas menu of appetizers, a fresco painted by a local artist and even alcoholic drinks.
It is the first location of the Taco Bell Cantina restaurants in the chain, which are aimed at young people, concentrated in increasing numbers in city centers.
Taco Bell, which has almost 6,000 restaurants in the United States, has its roots mainly in the suburbs and is associated with cheap food, quickly prepared, such as Doritos Locos Taco, extremely popular.
With an average payment note of 7 USD Taco Bell, the company used drive-through service and quick services to attract the number of customers needed to make profits.
But Taco Bell says that in order to address the new generation that "searchs for more central urban environments in which to live, work and enjoy", test locations must follow a different model, with smaller spaces and more expensive options.
So you can do a drive-through, you need land.
Can you imagine what it means to buy an acre of land in an area like Wicker Park?
"Don't allow yourself," said US TODAY Neil Borkan, franchisor Taco Bell who will operate the location in Chicago.
At the location of Chicago, the new menu will be prepared alongside the traditional Taco Bell offers, in an open kitchen, where "you will be able to see your own food" before being prepared, told the Associated Press Meredith Sandland, head of development at Taco Bell.
Also, wine, beer and frozen alcoholic drinks will be served at the new location, following the recent example of many of the Taco Bell competitors.
Now, seventy-five Starbucks cafes offer "nightly" menus that include beer, wine and snacks.
One thousand of the approximately 1900 Chipotle restaurants offer alcoholic drinks.
The company said that another Taco Bell Cantina location will open in San Francisco next to AT&T Park this month, replacing drive-through service and parking with an indoor yard and a sales window.
These changes in location, atmosphere and attachments indicate that the chain of fast food restaurants wants to attract other types of customers besides those looking for fast food late at night.
Taco Bell decided for the first time on a higher quality culinary line in 2012, when he inaugurated more expensive Cantina and burritos menus to compete with Chipotle, the project being supported by an advertising campaign focused on the protein content of new preparations.
If they succeed, the Cantina restaurants will represent another step towards a higher level.
Taco Bell said that by 2022 he intends to open 2000 restaurants in the United States.
As Sandland said for AP, "a few hundred" of these will be "Cantine".
They burned the phones in the middle of the night: Elton John makes Putin's yard
Russian President Vladimir Putin contacted Elton John only a few days after the British artist publicly declared that he wanted to meet Russian politician to discuss the old legislation together in Russia.
The British singer, declared homosexual, tried without success to get an interview with Putin while he was in Russia in November 2014, one year after he challenged the protests in this country and held two concerts in 2013, in a turbulent period in the history of this state, after the adoption of controversial laws, which prohibit "homosexual propaganda" in the children's ranks.
In 2014, in Sankt Petersburg, British artist criticized these laws and made the following statement to fans: "Although I am gay, I always felt welcome here in Russia."
If I wasn't honest about what I am, I couldn't compose these songs.
It doesn't mean gay propaganda.
They represent the way I express my life.
If we start punishing people for this, then the world will lose its humanity.
Last Saturday, the artist revealed that he wished to meet Putin to discuss this controversial issue.
So far, there is no clear information on the phone conversation between the two personalities.
Cocos "sing" all in the ANRP file
Businessman Dorin Cocos tries to save himself from a scorching sentence, "singing" in front of the judges and detailing how he shared millions of euros to former members of the ANRP Commission.
Yesterday at the High Court of Marriage and Justice in the case where he is tried with his son or Alin Cocos, former head of DIICOT Alina Bica and former members of the Central Commission for the Settlement of Damages under the ANRP, Dorin Cocos was struck by the lightning of sincerity.
He admitted all the charges and told judges how he helped the businessman Gheorghe Stelian in the case of damages from the ANRP, instead asking to be judged more quickly and to take into account his collaboration.
Thus, Cocos showed that he had known Gheorghe Stelian since 2006 and had been engaged with him after several real estate businesses.
He specified that Sergiu Diacomatu met him in 2010, and he told him he was working at the ANRP.
Then I found out that (Diacomatu, n.r.) is vice president, and because Gheorghe Stelian had a file at ANRP, I asked him to help us.
I promised him money, 2.5 million euros, money I told him I'd give him in more trances.
I promised him political support, to stay in function.
"Diacomatu then told me that he was helping me, but he needed support," Dorin Cocos pointed out in the courtroom.
He also said that later, through knowledge, he came into contact with Crinuta Dumitrean, who was then head of the Central Compensation Commission, who promised him 800,000 euros.
For Gheorghe Stelian's second file, I knew he wanted to get over 300,000 euros.
Diacoma already had political support, I gave her five million euros.
Dumitrean's crook a million euros, Dragos Bogdan I gave him 800,000 euros.
I need all this money to put him in a trance so I can make sure the file's settled.
"That's how I told them to fix the file, fix the damages," Cocos said.
Asked why he came to do these things, Dorin Cocos said he received eight million euros for the positive resolution of Gheorghe Stelian's second file.
I received, for the second file, eight million euros to solve the problem, but I only got 1.2 million euros.
In 2013, I also met Alina Bica.
"I never talked to this money or land," Cocos said.
He also pointed out that "the era of notoriety as the ANRP all members understood before the meeting."
I wasn't nervous that they wouldn't give a positive vote.
All functions were political in the ANRP, but I personally didn't help Diacomatu politically.
"I told him I'd help him politics just to calm him down," Cocos concluded.
Ponta brings the European Court of Justice to DNA
Prime Minister Victor Ponta was in DNA yesterday, for only five minutes, when he filed new documents in the "Turcani - Rovinari" file.
Victor Ponta escaped DNA with a European Court of Justice document
Convinced that the case prosecutor will receive him for a discussion on the side of the file where he is researched for fake entries under private signatures, complicit in tax evasion and money laundering, Victor Ponta went from his own initiative to DNA, although the documents that could have been sent by counsel.
It wasn't like that, because the prosecutor didn't have time, the primer leaving after five minutes, when he left several documents at the registry.
I wanted to file (file n.r.) the decision of the European Court of Justice of 3 September explaining what happens to service contracts.
I say we've done business, the prosecutor says we haven't, the European Court of Justice has told us to see each other's business, because as long as the taxes are paid, it's okay.
"From the point of view of the European Court of Justice, which is mandatory, of course, for all countries of the European Union, we do not have a case here," Prime Minister Victor Ponta said at the exit of DNA.
Ponta also said that, from the point of view, the decision of the European Court should apply if we are EU members.
Until then, the prime minister expects the prosecutor to read out the decision of the European Court and call it back to hearings, but also to give him an answer to his requests, including the file's disqualification.
Iohannis enjoys his mandate without television
In Romania today, there is no legal provision to force you to watch TV.
And you don't even own such a device, since you pay your TV fee once you bill for energy.
But if you're the head of the state, things change radically.
Because, in practice, it is assumed that the position of the President of Romania is also included in the connection to everyday realities.
President Iohannis sinks daily in total silence in the office or from Cotroceni
Only to the astonishment of his closest men at the Cotroceni Palace, Klaus Iohannis refused to have television in the presidential office.
And after not watching TV - no programs, not even German posts RTL or Pro Sieben -, the president does not listen to radio stations and does not read newspapers.
In addition, it does not even receive "negative monitoring" which, for example, the predecessor or a priority request.
On the other hand, Ihannis is pleased to receive only the relationship with the news that puts him in a positive light.
And next to this informational self-isolation, in which the only breach is access to the facebook, much more serious is the blocking to which, through its passiveness, the head of the state pushes the entire activity of the Presidential Administration.
And that's because, although he's been so bitter since his installation in office, Johnnis hasn't yet signed the statements of loyalty of more than half of the employees of the Presidential Administration.
Which becomes an increasingly serious problem, both from a human point of view and legal point of view.
Quiet and peaceful
Those in the presidential entourage are already clear that no one and nothing can damage "feng shui" from the office of the head of state.
Where it's quiet and peace.
What is right, only after nine hours without a minute (no more, no less!), in the morning, when the former building of Sibi asks for the presence of the officials.
A habit that probably didn't stand out from the time he was leading the primary city of Cibin.
And about the fact that Iohannis doesn't want television in his office has already been born with no legends, being already people from the Cotroceni Palace who have become inclined towards the variant that the president would try to avoid his monitoring.
Especially since he doesn't have any radio devices.
Only at this rate will they meditate as soon as possible in the dark, because the lighting equipment can also hide the audio-video recording technique.
Just fine.
Also, another strangeness from the Cotroceni Palace is the delivery to the head of the state only of the "positive monitoring" of the president's activity.
I mean, if there's any good news about Klaus Iohannis or his wife, the head of state will get the contents on the bio.
If not, no!
And more interesting is that he was banned from "negative monitoring" under conditions where, for example, Traian Basescu was recognized not only as a result of the night television broadcasts on which he was criticized, but he asked every morning, with priority, for negative news.
That doesn't mean museums like he helped him with something, but, that talk, the gesture matters!
And at least he can't ever have the excuse that he wasn't well informed from alternative sources.
Not outside, not confirmed
Now, after all, love her and mystery why she doesn't want to watch Klaus Iohannis on television.
Until then, however, it would be more important to resolve, regardless of the formula, the contractual situation of hundreds of employees of the Presidential Administration.
Which, in order to be able to work here, are obliged to sign a declaration of loyalty to the head of the state and which must also bear its signature.
Only that, from December and so far, Klaus Iohannis has not signed for confirmation at least half of these statements, although this should have happened in no more than 30 days.
So hundreds of employees, representing over half of Cotroceni Palace staff now have an uncertain situation.
Because, legally speaking, if the head of state doesn't personally sign their statement, they should be thrown out.
Only that they didn't all get any negative opinion!
So, at one point, they can come anytime to the Court of Auditors, who will find that, over half a year, so many hundreds of people have received their salaries at least somewhere on the edge of the law.
That until the president decides whether to kick him out or confirm him in the positions, the decision being strictly his.
The authorities said a teenager was launching an attack on Pope Francis during his visit to the United States.
The inspired ISIS plan of a teenager to attack Pope Francis during his visit to the United States was rather "aspirational" than operational, confirmed on Tuesday a police source for Fox News.
The 15-year-old boy was arrested in the Philadelphia area in August when the law enforcement authorities took over the plan.
The plan is the same as the representative of Texas, Mike McCaul, the president of Internal Security during an interview on Sunday, said a source for Fox News.
"We monitor very carefully the threats against the Pope for his visit to the United States of America," McCaul said at ABC's "This Week".
Pope Francis was not referred to as the specific target of the plan in a bulletin.
the common information of the FBI and the Department of Internal Security of 14 August, in which it is claimed that the adolescent planned to use more attackers, firearms and explosives, having as target "a foreign dignitary during a high-level event".
The bulletin states that the minor has been radicalised through social networks.
He may have suffered from mental illness, said a source of the law enforcement authority for Fox News, but without giving accurate details about the young man’s disease.
On Sunday, McCaul also acknowledged the potential for an attack by a so-called "lover lonely" at the entire nation level and noted that it was informed by the Secret Services about a "strict secret location" for the visit of the Pope.
And with that comes a great security risk... But as the date approaches, I think we'll all be very vigilant and protect it when it gets to the United States.

The skeleton from the medieval period discovered in the tree suffered a violent death, experts say
Irish archaeologists have revealed amazing details about the strange skeleton dating from the medieval period, found at the root of a 215-year-old tree.
The Collooney Fae, Sligo, fell during a storm this year, bringing to light the macabre view of a skeleton caught between its roots.
The Irish Service of National Monuments has brought experts from the Sligo-Leitrim Archaeological Services to excavate and analyze the remains, thus discovering a frightful story.
"He was killed violently," said Marion Dowd, director of the Sligo-Leitrim Archaeological Services, for FoxNews.com.
In the upper part of the chest has wounds caused by the knife. It also has such a trail in the left hand, which suggests that it tries to defend itself.
The skeleton is of a young man between the ages of 17 and 20.
Radiocarbon analysis shows that the remains are between 900 and 1000 years old.
"We cannot know if he was killed in battle or in a personal dispute," says Dowd, noting that the body was buried after Christian ritual, with his head headed west.
"Probably he was buried by family or community," she added.
Dowd told FoxNews.com that whoever planted the tree didn't know about the grave.
"It was just a coincidence, the context is an unusual one," she said.
There are historical documents showing that there was a church and a cemetery in the area, but today there are no visible traces of them.
There is still an unusual aspect of discovery: the height of the young man.
"It's 1 metre 77," says Dowd.
For early medieval society, that means quite a lot.
The federal government spends 1.5 million dollars to study what babies think about food
National Institutes for Health (NIH) spent almost $1.5 million studying what small children think about food.
The project, called "The way in which babies and young children perceive food" is carried out by the University of Chicago and, so far, has established that young people are not willing to eat smooth food from other people or who have sneezed others.
According to the project's financier, "appropriate nutrition is important for health and longevity, but many Americans do not have nutritionally healthy diets".
There is evidence that the first food models of babies and young children have long-term consequences for the health of their entire life.
The premise for this study is that there is a lack of research on how babies look at food.
“Despite the complexity and significance of the food selection, psychologists for the development of the child have dedicated little attention to the study of the way infants and young children perceive, learn and understand food, the financier said.
The current proposal applies methods of cognitive development to test social influences on the choice and consumption of food in infants and young children.
Researchers say about babies that they have "limited food knowledge".
Children between three and six years of age "know more about food than babies and young children", but are "extremely mofturous consumers".
An actress who played "Star Trek: Voyager" is accused of indecent exposure in Tennessee
An actress who played "Star Trek: Voyager" television show was arrested in the east of Tennessee, being accused of being exposed to children.
Several media channels report that actress Jennifer Ann Lien, aged 41, who played Kes' role in the television series, is accused of two indecent exposure offences involving children under 13 years of age, according to the arrest report.
The officers of the Roane County sheriff's office brought the arrest warrant to Lien's home in Harriman on September 3, where they said they found an empty undercover on the couch.
The officers said that Lien refused their demands to dress.
Harriman's chief of police, Randy Heidle, says that Lien has received several charges, including the aggravated bodily injury, after the April incident in which he says that Lien has entered a police car with his personal car.
He still doesn't know if he has a lawyer.
Police identified the victim found in the Epping Forest
A man whose decomposition body was discovered in a tourist forest was identified.
On 9 September, 53-year-old Hidir Aksakal was found near Hollow Ponds in the Epping forest in northeastern London.
The man of Turkish origin lived in Margate, Kent, and had close ties to the Green Lanes area of Haringey, north of London.
The last time he was seen in Green Lanes in the morning of Monday, August 17.
A postmortem analysis proved he was killed, and detectives say his body has probably been in the Epping forest for several weeks.
Inspector General Jamie Piscopo of the Metropolitan Police said: “Mr. Aksakal was very well known locally as the Cetin Boxer and we hope to find out from the Green Lanes community information to help us in the investigation.
Hollow Ponds is a busy and popular tourist resort, where there is a cafe and a lake for boat rides.
It is also surrounded by streets with intense traffic.
Please all those who have been in the area in recent weeks and may have noticed some unusual or suspicious activity, come and talk to us.
Super chief: six women juggle between maternity and service
Unlike any other country in the world, except Papua New Guinea, there is no centralised policy on paid maternity leave in the United States.
Two weeks ago, when the executive director of Yahoo, Marissa Mayer, announced that she was pregnant with twins, but she was going to take a very short maternity leave and "work during" her spare time, the 40-year-old woman was widely criticized for encouraging a culture that awaits the female or nothing.
But mayer, herself a symbol of the top woman, is to blame for unrealistic expectations?
How are other women leaders doing?
Seema Patel, a lawyer and deputy director of the San Francisco Labour Standards Office, just got a government job in Washington DC a few years ago when her boss amazed her with unexpected advice.
"I don't know anything about you," her boss told her.
But if you're going to make a family in the future, grab your vacation now.
Patel's employer was the federal government, and she didn't even get a day's maternity leave paid as part of her employment contract.
During that time, Patel was single and very focused on his career, and the family was the last thing he was thinking about.
But she listened to her boss's advice.
She avoided using her days of medical leave for four years, so when she was pregnant with her first child two years ago, she had completed three months of paid leave.
Six months ago, when he was born the second child, Patel could no longer apply the same strategy.
The four months of vacation he took were completely missed.
Patel says she didn't feel rejected by her colleagues, but she has a problem with the structure of work.
"I find it very discouraging for anyone trying to have a family," she says.
Send a message: Your country does not put any value on the fact that you will become a parent.
Karen Choi, Vice President at the Capital Group asset management firm, says that any woman employed who is and mother should be praised.
Choi, who has four children, one of whom is a six-month-old baby, describes the juggling between the quality of mother and job as "a constant struggle".
The secret not to sink is to have "an incredible family with you" and a nanny and a babysitter, to accept that there are things that aren't going to be the best ("not everyone can be Martha at home arrangements") and just go through it.
Choi says she took an increasingly high maternity leave for each child, starting from two and a half months for the first and ending six months for the last.
That makes her an exception, especially in her field of activity.
When your child is sick, has a fever, puke and you stay up all night to look after him and you know that the next morning you have to take your other kids to school, then go to work...
Then it gets very complicated," she says.
But her company supported her and stated that her investment portfolio performance had nothing to suffer.
When she entered the finance industry after university, about 20 of her college colleagues had chosen the same way, she says.
Today, about 90% of them have given up.
Women who give up the job, then start again don't have the same chances at top paid positions well, she says.
It is difficult to remain: “In the short term it is a sacrifice, but in the long term the results are seen.”
Anyway, her children helped her make sense of this sacrifice, because all four of her children are girls.
One of the things that helps me to go on is that I would like to be a model for them.
The idea of being an example for her four children is what motivates scientific researcher and teacher Kelly Posner, aged 48.
Children know that their mother helps, in her own way, to save human lives.
Posner, founder and director of the Centre for the Evaluation of the Risk of Suicide at Columbia University, says it is important that women know that they can have a "great objective" in terms of career and fulfill it.
It's very important that women think they can have a vision.
Most don't allow themselves to believe that," she says.
He once held a presentation in front of 200 people, including government officials, in Italy during a webinar, when she was pregnant in eight months.
She also helped technology, she says, because she can stop the car and answer the phone after she picks up her children or responds to an e-mail from the walk.
The gap between maternity and a requesting career has been helped by an optimistic personality, inclined to solve problems, she says. Of the ability to bring things to a successful end even when this seems impossible.
Jennifer Epps-Addison, aged 33, the executive director of Wisconsin Jobs Now and mother of two children, says that making maternity and career work together only through private aid networks, such as bonnets, is wrong.
"You shouldn't be lucky or win the lottery to succeed," she says, describing the failure of the system to support women and families - mentioning the very low wages, the poor health system and the lack of a paid maternity leave.
"As a society, we don't care for each other," she says.
We can't even guarantee the recovery of mothers who were just born.
Epps-Addison, who was pregnant while attending law school, gave birth to her baby while she was receiving a scholarship.
With a husband and a child based on the health care offered by the scholarship, the labour leader was able to take a maternity leave for only two weeks and then returned to work.
Lisa Mosko, a fashion designer and mother of two children, says that fewer and fewer women will abandon their profession if they receive more social support, in the form of day care services from companies, the maintenance of programmes agreed upon and the acceptance of the fact that effective work does not mean staying out of program.
At the forefront of logistical constraints, says Mosko, there is the additional pressure to activate in an area where being a mother is sometimes synonymous with the epitome of lack of taste ("mother's clothes" is one of the most serious insults).
“The image is part of our job – it lifts you up or pulls you down,” she explains.
Moscow's "permanent negotiation" for its multiple roles to work harmoniously means keeping its appearance and a nice bag in hand, from which, however, sometimes to fall a double toy.
If he remembers that even men are fathers, society could allow women to do more.
People don't judge men that they're not good fathers to the extent that they judge women who are mothers.
Shola Olatoye, the president and executive director of the New York Housing Authority, who deals with homes of over 400 000 New Yorkers and has over 11,000 employees, says that maternity and career do not mean to talk about "balance".
The notion of balance is a little inappropriate.
It looks more like a swing," she says.
Three-child mother, one of whom is only three months old, she just took a maternity leave seven weeks after she was born this year.
“It was a very important time for the agency,” she explains.
She knew that seven weeks would not be enough, but her husband managed to take his paternity leave, and she managed to have a flexible program, which meant leaving early or late, so that she could breastfeed her child.
Olatoye, who runs with her friends every morning ending at 06:00 (" cheaper than therapy") still breast-feeds.
At work, he tried to create a "friendliness for parents" environment, in which delay due to a child is permitted, and the response to e-mails must not be sent out of the office.
"The concept and the notion of the family have changed and changed greatly," says Olatoye.
"The family is very different from what was 25 or even 10 years ago."
The job is the one that needs to adapt.
Russian humorous people say they tricked Elton John about a call from Putin.
For cynics it seemed too nice to be true: a phone from Vladimir Putin, President of Russia, to Sir Elton John, singer and activist for the rights of sexual minorities, in which to discuss the rights of homosexuals.
Unfortunately for John, it was not true: despite an exuberant post on Instagram in which he thanked the Russian leader for addressing him about the problem, it immediately became clear that whoever called him on Monday night was certainly not Putin.
The Kremlin had already declared that he had no knowledge of that conversation.
And on Wednesday, two famous Russian humorous people acknowledged that they, not the president, had been the foreign voices from the other end of the conversation.
"We thought it was unlikely that Putin would want to meet him or call him, or at least not too soon," says Vladimir "Vovan" Krasnov, who imitated Putin, while his colleague Alexa "Lexus" Stoliarov became the spokesman of President Dmitri Peskov.
"But it seems Elton John was actually waiting for this phone, so he immediately thought it was really a conversation with the right people we were giving ourselves," he said for the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda.
He said, “Thank you, it was the surprise of the day.”
This day and this conversation were the most wonderful and delightful of my life.
In order to complete John's embarrassing situation, the two announced that they would publish a recording of the conversation on a popular Russian night show.
John's representatives didn't give statements about speculation.
On the basis of the story are the comments made by the singer during the weekend, in which he criticized Putin for his "ridical" attitude toward homosexuals while the LGBT rights militia in Kiev, particularly criticizing a Russian law adopted in 2013, which prohibits the spread of "propaganda for non-traditional sexual relations" among minors.
"I would like to meet [Putin], let's talk," John said to BBC, saying that although the idea was "probably unrealistic", it still deserved a try.
Then, Monday evening, the singer aroused the distrust of observers when she posted a message on a social network, claiming that Putin responded to his critics by taking the phone and calling him.
He said “he looked forward to meeting [the president] face-to-face to discuss LGBT equality in Russia”.
Unfortunately for John, Putin was not the one at the end of the other line, but Stoliarov and Krasnov, known for telephones given in the joke of many Russian and Ukrainian celebrities and politicians.
Stoliarov, who speaks well English, played Peskov's role and pretended to be the interpreter of the two.
When asked about the possibility of a conversation, the true Peskov told the journalists Tuesday that Putin would be "ready to meet Elton John and answer all his questions," but that no such request was received from the singer at Kremlin.
The Kremlin had reason to question the authenticity of the Instagram post, he added, “especially because it is not entirely written in a correct English.”
We don't think Sir Elton John would have written with similar grammar errors.
Even before the Russian duel declared its public prank, the local media already assumed that John had been the victim of a joke.
Some online users had identified Krasnov as guilty, known for the pranks made to telephone politicians they record and post them on their YouTube channel as Vovan222.
Phone calls in a joke to public people, then publishing records has become a real phenomenon in Russia in recent years.
Stoliarov, who is regarded by many as the initiator of the genre, has developed his talent to prank Ukrainian politicians.
He was interviewed on the phone on Ukrainian television by imitating Anton Gerashchenko, direct adviser to the Minister of Internal Affairs, Arsen Avakov.
He imitated Gerashchenko so well that last year he spoke to the former governor of Dnipropetrovsk, Ihor Kolomoiski, more than six hours in several days.
Krasnov became known after the 2011 parliamentary elections which led to massive street protests after mass fraud reports.
Acting as Arkadi Dvorkovich, the president's adviser to Dmitri Medvedev, convinced the chairman of the electoral committee, Vladimir Churov, that Medvedev intended to fire him.
In addition to numerous Russian celebrities, among his victims were former USSR President Mihail Gorbachev, Kiev's mayor and box champion Vitali Klitschko and Russian sports minister Vitali Mutko, who tricked him into apologizing for his athletes' drunken behavior.
Last year, Krasnov would have called Belarusian President Aleksandr Lukașenko, becoming the son of the outgoing Ukrainian leader, Viktor Yanukovici.
It was so convincing, that the person at the other end, whose voice resembled Lukasenko, offered him asylum.
John's initial statement that he would like to talk to Putin caused a huge reaction in Russia.
Lawyer Vitali Millonov of St. Petersburg, who contributed to the "propaganda" law, told The Guardian that John should not bother Putin with such an "irelevant subject" and that he was ready to meet with the singer to explain Russia's position.
The newspaper Moskovsky Komsomolets opened an online poll for readers, in which 39% of respondents felt that Putin and John should meet, and 22% thought that such a meeting would damage Putin's reputation.
A new study shows that more people die from air pollution than malaria and HIV/AIDS
According to a new reference study, more than 3 million people per year die prematurely due to outdoor air pollution, more than malaria and HIV/AIDS together.
The main cause, especially in Asia, is firewood and coal for heating homes and cooking, but research shows that such an alarming reason is agricultural emissions from Europe and the United States, which are the main reason for these deaths.
The report warns that if no action is taken, the number of deaths - already equivalent to six deaths per minute - will double by 2050.
"These projections should trigger an alarm signal for public health agencies around the world," said Professor Michael Jerrett, environmental expert at the University of California, who was not involved in research.
Most of the deaths caused by the rain of the air are caused by tiny particles, which can be inhaled deep into the lungs.
They cause heart attack and stroke, which are responsible for three quarters of the 3.3 million deaths per year, while the rest are caused by lung cancer and respiratory disease.
Research did not include the effects of indoor air pollution, for example from cooking fires, which is estimated to cause another 3.4 million deaths per year.
The new study, published in Nature newspaper, was the first to highlight various sources of outdoor air pollution and estimated the number of premature deaths caused by these, taking into account road traffic, fossil fuel power plants and other sources.
Researchers have used a detailed computerized model of the global atmosphere to assess the impact of air pollution on different populations, including new information on how pollution affects the inhabitants of China and India.
A third of all premature deaths were the result of the use of fumbling fuels, such as wood and coal, for heating homes or cooking, and the use of dirty diesel generators for electricity, all being recognised dangers.
The consumption of this type of internal energy causes half of India's 645 000 annual deaths and one third of China's 1.4 million annual deaths.
However, research has found that ammonia agricultural emissions have had a "remarkable" impact, according to Professor Jos Levelveld of Germany's Max Planck Chemical Institute, which led the research.
A fifth of the global deaths are caused by these emissions, mainly from cattle, birds and pigs and from excessive use of fertilizers.
The ammonia reacts with the exhaust gases from traffic and industry and produces tiny particles, being the main reason for the deaths due to pollution of the air in the east of the United States, Japan and Europe.
"For London, agriculture is the main source," says Leslieveld.
Throughout the United Kingdom, 48% of premature deaths were the result of agricultural pollution.
Traffic pollution is still an important factor in developed countries, causing one fifth of the deaths, despite measures against polluting vehicles.
It only caused 5% of deaths worldwide, but the figure could increase as more and more cars appear on the streets in developing countries.
The air pollution by the power plant, especially those operating with coal, was significant globally, causing one of seven deaths.
In the United States it is the main single factor, causing one third of the 55 000 deaths per year, compared with 16% in the United Kingdom.
Natural air pollution, especially in arid and very dusty regions, has caused almost one fifth of the global deaths caused by air pollution.
This source is a major factor in some arid countries, being responsible for 92% of the deaths in Egypt and 81% in Iran.
"The overlap between the high level of pollution and the large number of people says their word about public health, but nothing else is known about sources of pollution responsible for premature deaths," Jerrett says.
The results are surprising and potentially important for the protection of public health at global level.
All particles are currently supposed to be as toxic.
But if those caused by the burning of fuels are more toxic, as some scientists suspect, the percentage of premature deaths that can be attributed to agricultural emissions would be lower.
Even so, Jerrett says "discovery is very valuable... because agriculture has not generally been seen as a major source of air pollution or premature death and suggests that much more attention should be paid to agricultural sources, both from scientists and politicians."
Dr. Oliver Wild, an atmosphere expert at Lancaster University in the United Kingdom, said: “The study really highlights the need for air quality control, in order to avoid these deaths, especially in highly populated areas of Asia.”
A statement by Victor Ponta tenses even more relations with Hungary
Budapest asks Ponta to stop lying, the Roman prime minister talks about attitudes that remind us of Nazism
The relations with Hungary, already tense after the announcement of the construction of a border fence with Romania, after the Serbian border, have experienced a new depreciation following the statements made by Prime Minister Victor Ponta, who on Monday accused the authorities of Budapest of treating refugees "with bat and inserted".
The Hungarian Diplomacy reacted hard by talking about "extremist and lying" claims, but neither did Victor Ponta stand up and accused government officials in the neighbouring country of being "a shame" for Europe.
It should be noted that it is not for the first time when Ponta tries to tense Roman-Hungarian relations through statements made at delicate or electoral times.
It all started from a statement made on Monday by Victor Ponta, in which he tried to argue that Romania could not receive more than 1,800 refugees.
The problem with our logistics of treating those people like people, not how our neighbors treat Hungarians, with bat and inserted.
I don't agree with that.
Mr. Basescu has put himself at the forefront of a ugly and horrible feeling that exists in all societies, namely a xenophobic feeling.
It's very good to have a debate, but we're going to have to solve the problem.
"We'll treat those people like us," Victor Ponta said months, quoted by the Truth.
It is not clear what Victor Ponta referred to when he spoke about the insertion of refugees, but Czechia was recently at the centre of criticism after he wrote numbers on the hands of migrants on several trains, in a gesture that remembered the procedure used by Nazis to identify Jewish prisoners in the concentration camps.
Peter Szijjarto appreciated, according to the Hungarian news agency MTI, taken over by magyaridok.hu, as probably the internal political crises that shook Victor Ponta's position make him make the statement "extremist and lying".
The Romanian businessman from Budapest was summoned to provide explanations, mediafax informs, quoting MTI.
"Mr. Victor Ponta recently made inadequate statements about how Hungary manages the immigration crisis," says the Hungarian Foreign Ministry.
Levent Magyar, State Secretary for Foreign Trade and Foreign Affairs in the Hungarian MAE, expressed "surprise" in connection with Victor Ponta's "constant attempts to save his controversial moral position through anti-unique lies", stresses Budapest's diplomacy.
"I don't want to answer the challenges that have come from Hungarian government representatives - but read the story below and you will understand the indignation that I feel, as a man and a European citizen, of the mentality and attitudes that Europe saw only in the 1930s-40s!!!," Ponta wrote on his Facebook account.
He claims that, like other European policies, he has "the duty" to draw attention and sanction "the constant behaviour of government officials of the highest level in Hungary" who are "a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union" by "anti-semit attitudes", "the treatment of minorities of all kinds, and now in the refugee crisis!"
"Arma chimpata, aggressive laws, prisons and brutality will certainly not solve the problem - they will only show that in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, they are political decision-makers with nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which refugees are fleeing!", accused Ponta, claiming that he believes in "solidarity, rational and sustainable solutions, and above all European values", and "what we see in the last days in Hungary is in complete contradiction with these objectives and values!"
During the evening Ponta was invited to Antenna 3, where the main subject constituted Hungary.
If Mihai Gada called Viktor Orban the black sheep of Europe, a dictator, Ponta wondered what would happen if the Hungarian military took over and shot or killed some children or women, in a speech in which he made more references to Nazism.
In the dispute, UDMR President Kelemen Hunor also intervened, who considers that the Roman authorities should not have a "feeling approach" in relation to Hungary's intention to build a fence at the border.
The UDMR leader says that it must be understood that this solution is not directed against Romania or Roman citizens, he showing that the fence could even help our country not become an intense transit route by migrants who want to reach the Schengen area, according to Agerpres.
First of all, I want to point out, I mean, that we don't have to hysteria, take this whole thing as something against Romania and not have to use it to worsen the relationships between the two governments anyway, because that's not the case.
I think any sentimental approach, visceral isn't right.
"We must see the rational part, see why we have come here and we must know and say this, that it is not against us, it is not against Romania, of Roman citizens and does not prevent free movement between the two states within the EU," Kelemen Hunor said.
The West ignored Russia's offer to raise Bashar al-Assad from Syria's leadership in 2012
Russia proposed more than three years ago the removal of the President of Syria, Bashar al-Assad, as part of a peace agreement, according to a high official involved at that time in negotiations with closed doors between the Western countries and the Russian Federation, writes The Guardian.
The former President of Finland and winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, Martti Ahtisaari, said Western powers have not benefited from the proposal since.
Since 2012 tens of thousands of people have died and millions have been forced to flee the country, giving birth to the worst refugee crisis since the end of World War II.
Ahtisaari held discussions with representatives of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council (SUA, the United Kingdom, France, the Russian Federation, and China) in February 2012.
He further stated that during the talks, Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churchin offered a plan that included among others and the proposal addressed to Assad to give up power at some point after the beginning of peace negotiations between regime and opposition.
He proposed three things:
One-- we don't have to arm the opposition.
Two - we must initiate a dialogue between Assad and opposition immediately.
"Three - we must look for an elegant way for Assad to withdraw," Ahtisaari said, relating the position of the Russian ambassador.
However, he also said Ahtisaari, the United States, Britain and France were so convinced that the Syrian dictator was going to fall, that they ignored the Russian ambassador's proposal.
"It was a lost opportunity in 2012," Finland's former president continued.
Officially, Russia has firmly supported Bashar al-Assad over the course of four and a half years of war, insisting that its withdrawal cannot represent a proposal in any peace agreement.
Assad thinks Russia will never abandon him.
Moscow recently began sending troops, tanks and military aircraft to Syria, in an effort to stabilize the regime of Assad and to confront the extremists of the Islamic State.
Antena 3's live programme will be available against cost
Antenna 3 informed its viewers on Tuesday that from 1 November the program or live will be able to be watched online against cost, on the basis of a monthly subscription.
In a "writer to viewers", the news post of the Intact trust states that "we do this with a narrow heart, wanting to stay with us and in this new stage, imposed by the conditions of the market".
According to the same message, the subscription will be 1 euro per month "for those of you who are following us online", the television promising that viewing will be at a very good quality.
Antena 3 claims that "all these live broadcasts from the country and abroad, campaigns, daily news have been and are possible through a constant, assumed financial effort, which has assumed permanent retechnologicalisation and quality focus".
We managed to support ourselves, under conditions where the distributors offline and online contributed nothing to the content offered.
The announcement comes under conditions where the news television program is accessible on the basis of subscription and online platform Antenna Play, where, moreover, they were most often accessible exclusively and the recordings of the programs from Antenene.
Reports show that the population of marine animals and plants has halved in the last 40 years
The crisis of marine animals and plants is documented in detail in a study that states that marine species around the globe, including those essential for the safety of human food, are in a decline that can be catastrophic.
Unprecedented pressures from several directions to the global ocean ecosystem combine and create a round of difficulties for almost all marine life, says the WWF Blue Planet Report.
Coral reefs are subject to serious decline risks (WWF) Some marine habitats, such as mangroves and seaweed, which depend on many other species, have experienced a significant decline, while the entire population of fish with commercial value, such as macro and tuna, have decreased vertigo by three quarters compared to the 1970s, shows the report.
Many coral reefs, usually described as tropical forests of the oceans due to their huge biodiversity, could be threatened with extinction by the middle of this century if the ocean's acidity continues to worsen as a result of the increased levels of CO2 in the atmosphere, resulting in a direct proportional increase in the level of carbonic acid in the sea.
"Healthy seas are an extraordinary source of beauty and natural wonder and are also a basis for the functioning of the global economy," said Louise Heaps, Chief Marine Policy Advisor at WWF-UK, who contributed to the preparation of the report.
"By overfishing, which damage coastal habitats, and without solving the global warming problem, we sow seeds of an ecological economic catastrophe," says Dr. Heaps.
The report, based on a review of published scientific literature, but also on the Indices of the living planet, a database maintained by the London Zoo Society, is one of the most detailed studies on marine life ever undertaken.
Almost 20% of all mangrove areas disappeared between 1980 and 2005 (WWF) It researched a great variety of marine species, from fish, marine turtle frogs and sea cucumbers - an animal like a worm, with rough skin - to marine plants such as mangroves and algae.
The report found that the seaweed areas decreased by approximately 30% in the last century, while the total mangrove areas decreased by 20% between 1980 and 2005, mainly as a result of shrimp fishing and other forms of aquaculture.
Over a single generation, human activity has caused enormous damage to the ocean, catching fish faster than it can reproduce and also destroying their banks.
Deep changes are needed to ensure abundant ocean life in the next generations," said Marco Lambertini, CEO of WWF International.
Some of the most dramatic declines have been recorded in commercial profit species.
For example, 58 populations from 17 species belonging to the Scrombidae family - macro, tuna and sardines - decreased by 74% between 1970 and 2010, without showing signs of recovery, says the report.
We are in a fishing race that could end up depriving people of a vital source of food and an essential economic engine.
Overfishing, destroying marine habitats and climate change have serious consequences for the entire human population, and poor communities, which are based on the sea, will be hit the fastest and most powerful," Lambertini said.
"The collapse of ocean ecosystems could trigger a serious economic decline and could undermine our fight for poverty and undernutrition," he continued.
Professor Ken Norris, scientific director of the ZL, said: “These alarming figures prove how quickly people change plants and animals in the oceans and are a clear warning of the problems we may face as a result.”
Seaweed: deep-sea "passions", which captures mineral-rich sediments and stabilizes the bottom of the sea.
Over the last century, the cover area has decreased by 30%.
Mangroves: Their existence is known in 123 countries, almost half of the total area representing only five countries.
Almost 20% of all mangrove areas disappeared between 1980 and 2005, mainly because of human invasion.
Coral reefs: some of the richest and most biologically productive habitats on earth.
A quarter of the total marine species live in or near coral reefs, but three quarters of them are currently threatened and many may disappear during this century if the acidity of the ocean continues to worsen.
Deep habitats: very little is known about the deeper areas of the ocean, but the decline in the amount of fish caught in these inaccessible locations over the past 40 years suggests that they are affected by global marine change.
Steven Gerrard denies the accusations of racism that would have been brought to him by his former Liverpool teammate, El-Hadji Diouf
In a passage from his autobiography in "My Story", serialized by Daily Mail, Gerard criticizes the Senegalese player saying that "he is not really interested in football" and that he is the colleague he liked "the least" in the 17 years spent at the club.
As a reaction, Diouf would have responded to Gerrard's Senegalese radio station Grupo Futurs Medias, with quotes attributed to the attacker, who would have said that "Gerrard never liked color people."
Gerrard's lawyers denied any charges of racism brought to him.
In his most recent book, Gerard, who made himself public before and before his bad opinion of Diouf, criticized the attitude and degree of professionalism of his former colleague.
"I don't want to waste my time thinking about El Hadji Diouf, but I have to mention his wasted seasons in Liverpool as an example of how I can go things upside down," he writes.
“It seems to me that Diouf is not really interested in football and he doesn’t care about Liverpool,” he continued.
For example, the way he spat a huge and viscous phlegm in a Celtic fan in a game of the Uefa Cup at Parkhead in March 2003 is evidence of his contemptuous and spiteful behavior.
Diouf proved to be a controversial figure all the time spent on Anfield, his most famous night being Celtic Park.
The Senegalese advance was questioned by the police after the episode of the spit and amended with the equivalent of his salary for two weeks at the club, the amount of £60,000 being donated to a humanitarian organization in Celtic's election.
In his previous autobiography, published in 2007, Gerard describes Diouf as lazy and selfish.
"His attitude was completely wrong," Gerrard wrote.
I felt he wasn't just willing to make every effort to help Liverpool get back to the top.
Diouf, who now plays at the Malaysian Sabah club, publicly criticized Gerard and attacked Gerard's old friend and teammate Jamie Carragher.
In 2012, Diouf called Gerard "egoist" and claimed that no one on Anfield liked the player who led the team to the Champions League victory in 2005.
Diouf is also quoted as saying that Gerard is "zealous".
He said: “Gerrard is just jealous of me.
He didn't touch the results I had in football.
When I came to Liverpool, I came with the chief's status, and he lives there.
I am respected in the world of football, the greatest football experts have framed me among the first seven players at the World Championship and among the first 100 players of the century.
Many big players don't have a sense of belonging.
Wherever I go to other countries, I am revered, while Gerrard is fled whenever he leaves his hometown Liverpool.
From hero to professional dancer: Alek Skarlatos's quick way to "Dancing With the Stars"
At this season in "Dancing With the Stars", Alek Skarlatos does not only play the role of the hero in uniform.
It is also a young, attractive and athletic type, equally discreet and modern, tell the producers.
"We always look for the most popular of the moment," said Deena Katz, executive co-producer of the ABC show.
I swear he'll find his printer after that.
It's charming.
She's got something special.
Before he competed at the famous show - but only a few weeks earlier - Skarlatos arrived in the international press after taking a stand in the face of great danger.
He and his two childhood friends, Spencer Stone and Anthony Sadler, immobilized a man armed with an AK-47 on a train full of travelers traveling from Amsterdam to Paris.
The three stopped what might have been a mass murder by a possible terrorist.
After that, Skarlatos, aged 22 years old, sentry in the National Army, who grew up near Sacramento, received a phone from President Obama, a Twitter message from Donald Trump and a dinner with Arnold Schwarzenegger and was decorated by the American army and the French government.
Although some local appreciations may have anticipated - in Sacramento on Friday, a parade took place in the honor of the young man - did not expect so many positive reactions or the invitation to participate in "Dancing With the Stars".
"Near in a million years I wouldn't have thought I'd get this offer," said Skarlatos on Saturday, in a break from the dance rehearsals with his partner, Lindsay Arnold.
Everything seems new and crazy to me.
Even though before the show of Monday night he acknowledged that he was "emotional user", he managed as a professional at his first foxtrot, obtaining scores that brought him close to the front of the competition.
Carrie Ann Inaba, Bruno Tonioli and Julianne Hough, who formed the jury, said she offered one of the best performances of the evening.
Katz and executive producer at "DWTS" Rob Wade said that they want to keep a free place in the show for contestants invited over the last hundred metres, as is the case with Skarlatos, who grew up in the eyes of the public.
In this case, Katz heard about the three American friends on vacation who played a gun attack on a train with 500 passengers and immediately thought to invite one of them to the dance contest.
He searched social networks, found family members and sent messages to Skarlatos.
When he appeared at "Good Morning America" to report the incident during which Stone and other passengers were injured, Katz worked with the sister program at ABC to avoid going through all the media dams.
He supported his five-minute plea, then waited eagerly to find out if Skarlatos would agree to participate in the DWTS.
"For a while everything was very uncertain, because that's so different from what he does," Katz confessed.
A little while ago, I was fighting in Afghanistan, and now I was asking him if he's in the mood for dancing.
Scarlatos, who is on a short leave from the National Guard, had not even seen a whole show until recently.
He hesitated to participate, mainly because he didn't want to be just him highlighted.
The show couldn't invite all three friends.
But the producers had an ace in their sleeve: Noah Galloway, veteran of war, with their hands and legs amputated.
They encouraged Skarlatos to call Galloway, last season's favorite fan competitor and finalist, and ask him about his experience.
That was probably the critical point, along with Katz's unstoppable "following" and "the insistent messages," she said.
“ Noah is a wonderful guy and I wanted to know how the army will look and how the image of my friends will be protected,” Skarlatos said.
He told me I should go.
So after that conversation, I agreed.
Scarlatos, a great lover of sport and history, had never danced before, and Arnold confessed in interviews that he was trying to make him relax and give up the military position quite rigid.
But Katz says she's confident that she'll adapt and that the spectators will react positively.
He'll get a lot of love from the start, because people are proud of him and what he's done.
"How can you not support him?" said Katz.
But that'll only take a few weeks.
To move on, he needs to dance.
Scarlatos, who is a bachelor and wishes to become a cop, says that so far he has had fun in this completely unknown environment.
The program represented the hardest battle, being required to travel frequently to Los Angeles between the moments he was acclaimed in the media and the various awards ceremony.
He said that at the end of August, when he returned to the United States immediately after the train incident, he just wanted to relax with the family.
"That lasted about a day and a half," he said.
Totally, I've been home for four days.
There is a risk in taking over a person who attracts media attention, but it is not common to be in the light of the reflectors, said the executive producer Wade.
And the show wants to make sure the competitor gets along and has fun.
"The pressure is great and we want participants to have a pleasant experience," Wade said.
"We would never want Alek to say, "Aoleu, what did I get into?"
Let's keep his fists having fun.
McRib from McDonald's comes back.
The time has come for those who wait all year for the pork sandwich in the form of mini-coasts to enjoy.
But is it harder to find this year?
CNBC reports that only 55% of McDonald's franchises in the country offer this season specialty.
Last year, 75% of restaurants served McRib sandwich.
"At the 2015 McGib promotion, there are approximately 8,000 restaurants," McDonald's spokesman Lisa McComb said for The Times in an e-mail.
In the US there are a little over 14 300 restaurants of this fast-food.
But according to McComb, the individual owners of the franchise decide whether or not they will serve McRib.
"Participation is not significantly different from last year," McComb says.
Owners/operators are free to offer the menu they think their local customers want.
And if you're still wondering what a McRib is, McDonald's tried to explain the ingredients last year, with a video showing the reality.
According to the video, the McRib sandwich is prepared from pork, water, dextrose and preservatives.
The sandwich will be available by the end of the year at the McDonald's restaurants that attend.
There is also a website with locations where McRib is served (unaffiliated to McDonald's), which can be useful.
People can report on the website if they discover restaurants with McRib and can search the nearest place where this sandwich is served.
However, a quick search on the site shows that the nearest McRib restaurant in Los Angeles is located in Sevastopol in Sonoma County, discovered last Saturday by Aidan Briggsonian.
Sometimes I just can't fight with the taste of BBQ chicken pizza.
Keith Richards understands that new Rolling Stones recordings would be prepared
Keith Richards is again in the light of the reflectors with a new solo album and an appearance in a documentary, but soon the other members of the Rolling Stones band may join them in the studio.
Richards announced that he and the others from Stones - Mick Jagger, Charlie Watts and Ronnie Wood - have recently met in London and made "clear recording plans," as he says.
Tuesday night, Richards spoke in the ICONS series at iHeartRadio with reporter Jim Kerr.
A possible new album from Stones would be the first LP of the band after "A Bigger Bang" in 2005.
But the band wasn't at all inactive.
In recent years they have had many tournaments on stadiums and have performed several small concerts in L.A., including representatives at Echoplex and Fonda Theatre.
At the latter, they reinterpreted the classic LP of 1971, "Sticky Fingers".
In particular, Richards was busy this year, collaborating with the documentary "Keith Richards: Under the Influence", scheduled to be released on September 18 on Netflix.
This year, he released his third solo album "Crosseyed Heart" in a five-year career.
Randy Lewis from The Times described Richards' new album in a previous interview with the guitarist: "As always, Richards' harsh voice is a rather kinder than distinguished instrument...."
But Richards sparked emotion in all 15 songs of the album and that always meant, in fact, rock 'n' roll.
In the interview, Richards claims that the band will most likely enter the studio after the South American tour from the beginning of next year.
He gave no further details, but judging after the last concerts, the band is still very full of life.
Toronto Film Festival: Jason Bateman about childhood, maturity and "The Family Fang"
Jason Bateman has already gone through some difficult transitions in his career, with a discreet charm that made them seem much simpler than they actually were.
Once a child actor in television shows such as "Silver Spoons", as an adult has reaffirmed itself as an unexpressive typical in the television series "Crissive situation" and in films such as "Chefi of Nightmare".
The first film he worked as a director was the very acid comedy "Bad Words", in which he also played.
The film was nominated at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2013.
Bateman returned to Toronto this week with "The Family Fang", the second film he directed, an ambitious tonal film, adaptation of Kevin Wilson's 2011 popular novel. The screenplay is written by David Lindsay-Abaire, winner of the Pulitzer Prize, and in the film plays Nicole Kidman and Bateman, in the role of the brothers with problems.
The film has as its subject a festival that seeks American distribution.
Many reviews of the book considered it a comedy with strong emotional tents; the film reinterprets the story, putting more emphasis on its dramatic, darker side.
In an interview with our publication on Tuesday, Bateman says he has always considered the book more a drama than a comedy.
"I've never seen the book like this before," he confessed.
In the book, the subject and the themes are very dramatic and very human.
I thought Kevin was dealing with a very sensitive subject in a very funny way.
So that was always the order in which I saw things, a drama with moments of complacency and comedy and eccentricity.
The world premiere of the evening benefited from an introduction by the director of the festival's programme, Kerri Craddock, who expressed his enthusiasm especially with regard to the sitcom "The Hogan Family" since the late '80s and the early '90s, at which Bateman worked. "I never met too many fans "Hogan Family", said Bateman sec when he climbed on stage.
However, the few episodes he directed from that sitcom brought Bateman, who was 46 years old, to Directors Guild at the age of 18.
The story of his new movie has a family named Fang downtown.
Parents, Caleb and Camille (Christopher Walken and Maryann Plunkett), are artists with an average reputation, best known for the way they use their children, Annie and Baxter, in their performances, for example by setting up a bank robbery with the academies or playing the role of very weak street musicians.
At maturity, Annie (Kidman) and Baxter (Baman) strive to find their own identity.
Annie is an actress with some fame, although she is more famous for public scandals than for performance, and Baxter is a novelist and magazine journalist who tries to become famous.
When Caleb and Camille disappear under mysterious circumstances, Annie and Baxter suspect it's just another trick of theirs and try to discover the truth about their parents and find new truths about themselves.
I don't think it's hard to see what the story of children who want to evolve into adult life has been directly and deeply reflected in Bateman.
"My childhood was a very atypical one," Bateman confessed.
I started acting when I was 10, with parents as managers, and this movie has many elements that overlap with the way I grew up.
So I couldn't see the story as a superficial and fun one.
"It's a story I feel tied up with and I understand deeply," he added, "and although I did not try to add to it my personal experience, I knew very clearly how to show this film to represent children with a non-traditional childhood."
The project started with Kidman, and she produced the film, which obtained rights for Wilson's book.
After Wilson refused to write his own adaptation, Lindsay-Abaire was co-opted, who adapted his own "Treet to Reality" piece, in which Kidman played.
Bateman confesses that he accepted the chance to record the film and play in it.
(Kidman, currently on stage in London in the production "Photograph 51", did not participate in the premiere of months.
The author of the book was in public.)
In Hollywood Reporter, David Rooney called Bateman's film "an intelligent and caustic adaptation" which "gives the emphasis of the much-exploited clichés of the dysfunctional family and defuses the mission, sometimes of a lifetime, of children to understand their parents in ways that can be amusing and sweet-loving, incisive and usually very dark".
In Variety, Justin Chang called the film "a very rough portrait" and said that Bateman "provides visible progress and greater maturity as film director with this cleverly structured adaptation, but never too tight or mechanical".
After the Monday screening, when Bateman and Walken went up to the stage for the question session, the audience waved over the Walken multiple.
About Bateman as director and actor, Walken said during the question session that "I was impressed every day.
I couldn't believe the ease with which he changed the film director's work, which is very difficult, and the actor in the scene.
His concentration is truly amazing.
In a certain stage of dialogue, Bateman stands on a ladder in the family house behind the house, hidden in the barn, only a shadow of the profile, while Kidman is closer to the room and becomes clearer.
It's not hard to imagine Bateman the actor talking to Bateman the director about the fact that he can't be seen.
"I find it incredibly interesting to watch movies," said Bateman.
All my decisions come from this, I never take them to benefit me as an actor.
Having the privileged position of being responsible for creating the entire experience for the public, not just one instrument in that orchestra, being an actor, is a complete thing.
No matter that... actor wants a foreground.
During the question and answer session, Bateman confessed that, after reading the script, he immediately thought about Walken for Caleb's role, but also about composer Carter Burwell for the soundtrack.
Known primarily for his long friendship with the Coen brothers, Burwell also composed the soundtrack for two other films at the Toronto festival: the animation film "Anomalisa" - a story about love and isolation directed by Charlie Kaufman and Duke Johnson - and "Legend Gangsters", Brian Helgeland's interpretation of the English gangster twins of the 1960s, Ronnie and Reggie Kray.
Burwell also composed the soundtrack for Todd Haynes' "Carol".
“Works with long-lived tones or obtains seem very interesting to me,” says Bateman, giving more explanations on Tuesday.
Sail through those shades and guide the harmonious and somewhat elegant audience from one to the next during the film.
Carter has built his career and an incredible reputation as a person who can navigate among the most complicated tones.
With "The Family Fang", Bateman took another bold step, both as a director and as an actor, in a career dominated by reinventing and deciding, a mix of comedy and drama, light and darkness.
As Bateman confessed when he completed his introduction to the film at the World premiere of Monday, "Good, bad, came out exactly as I wanted."
The festival flashes like Oscars about the story of the Boston Globe investigation of pedophile priests
Did you win $240,000 at the lottery?
A ticket to the X-LOTTO worth over $240,000 is unclaimed for a month.
The unregistered ticket to the X-Lotto extraction was purchased from the Ingle Farm Shopping Centre on Montague Rd, Saturday, August 15.
Together with the winning ticket sold in South Australia, there have been another 16 winning tickets throughout Australia, which have divided their sole X-Lotto prize fund of $4 million.
SA Lotteries asks everyone who bought tickets at X-Lotto from Ingle Farm Lotteries Kiosk to check them out as soon as possible.
The winning numbers from the X-Lotto 3555 extraction on Saturday, August 15, are 36, 23, 12, 6, 28 and 26.
The additional numbers are 43 and 27.
Kath Venables, the manager of Ingle Farm Lotteries Kiosk, says he looks forward to receiving the good news that the winner of the prize has checked his ticket at X-Lotto.
"We have tried hard to spread the news, for a person is our winner and has no idea at all," she said.
Detectives at the forensics are investigating the house on Beadell Street, Burton, where the missing man Daniel Hind was last seen
Hind's sister Chelsea Hind said it's frustrating to wait for information about her missing brother, especially because the police offered two different versions of his journey the night he was last seen.
Her family had asked the police to search the house since her brother's disappearance.
"I was hoping they'd look into the house, we weren't informed they'd do it," she said.
Miss Hind further says that her family also wanted those who knew what had happened to her brother to speak and tell the truth to the police.
"We just want to find out where Daniel is and what he did that night," she said.
We're four children and we have many other family members and half of us think he's alive somewhere, and the other half I think he's not.
Anyway, we want him home and put an end to the stories.
Until 2022, Bulgaria will add 635 kilometers of highway
Until 2022, the Bulgarian government plans to build 635 kilometres of new highways and repair 17 000 kilometres of existing main and secondary roads.
The completion of the work for the Hemus, Struma, Maritsa, Cherno More and Kalotina motorways, all of which form part of the pan-European transport corridor, is among the priorities of the approved road infrastructure development plan on Wednesday.
The plan aims to create a sustainable road infrastructure in Bulgaria and integrate it into the European transport network, but also to ensure increased road safety and efficient road transport management, the government said.
Bulgaria is a transit country for trafficking in cultural goods in Syria
According to Interior Minister Rumyana Bahvarova, Bulgaria is a transit country for illicit trafficking in cultural goods stolen from the Middle East due to its geographical location.
During a speech held on Wednesday at a conference on combating the robbery of Syrian cultural heritage, Bahvarova recalled that Bulgaria's national legislation had been renewed to fit the new context, stressing the prohibition of cross-border trade in Syria and Iraq.
Bahvarova, quoted by the Bulgarian Press Agency (BTA), said that the efforts of the competent units of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, in particular the Directorate-General for Combating Organized Crime (GDBOP) focused on preventing smuggling and selling illegal Bulgarian cultural objects.
He said Bulgaria is a country with a rich history, which recent studies have placed on the third place, after Italy and Greece, in the top of trafficking in objects and cultural goods.
Bulgaria's internal minister has also shown that trafficking in cultural objects and destroying historical sites in areas such as Iraq and Syria are a phenomenon that has become widespread, being described as an extremely serious war crime.
He stressed that concerted and decisive measures are needed to stop the intentional destruction of history.
UNESCO Director General Irina Bokova noted that footage of illegal archaeological excavations in Syria demonstrates that the country is affected by industrial robbery.
Participants at the Wednesday conference acknowledged that Syria's cultural heritage is seriously endangered and that the international community must unite to stop the illegal trafficking of cultural goods from the war-stricken country.
Aerojet Rocketdyne says the program for the new AR-1 engine could be modified
Tuesday, Aerojet Rockedyne Holdings Inc said it is expected to complete the new AR-1 missile engine by 2019, to replace a Russian engine that will be banned soon, but the date could be changed if it does not receive enough funds from the US government.
Vice President Aerojet, Julie Van Kleeck, refused to give statements about the fact that Aerojet offered $2 billion to buy the United Launch Alliance (ULA), a mixed company with equal actions for missile launch of Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co.
Analysts say the auction amount is a strategic move of Aerojet to defeat its rival Blue Origin, a company owned by the founder Amazon.com, Jeff Bezos, who develops a new engine that ULA wants to use for its new Vulcan missile.
ULA says Blue Origin's engine program is about two years before Aerojet's AR-1 engine, a statement that Aerojet contradicts it.
Work on new engines became a priority after American legislators approved a ban on the use of Russian RD-180 engines for the launch of American military satellites or espionage, after the annexation of the Crimea region of Ukraine by Russia last year.
Van Kleeck states that Aerojet tests hardware equipment for engine, which is designed with three-dimensional printed parts to fit both in the Atlas 5 missile of ULA, now powered by the RD-180 engine, and in the new Vulcan missile that develops ULA and that costs approximately $1 billion.
Aerojet claims that it will be less costly and less risky to integrate its engine into the Atlas 5 missile than to develop a new engine and a completely new missile, as is currently planned by ULA.
Van Kleeck says Aerojet was planning to start testing large-scale engines in 2017, followed by obtaining the certificate in 2019, but the date could be postponed if the company does not receive enough funding from the Air Force in contracts expected at the end of the first half of the fiscal year 2016, which starts in October.
She further claims that the entire company was eager to see how the Air Force would share a funding of approximately $160 million among rival competitors.
It also says Aerojet was thinking of trying other private financing options for the engine, but did not provide details.
The Air Force Competition is a public-private partnership and each of the bidders must provide a third of the funding and the Air Force covers two-thirds.
Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, and Blue Origin, both private companies, have self-financed their engine creation process and say they are not necessarily looking for government funding.
The brewing company AB InBev plans a merger of USD 275 billion with SABMiller
Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR), the world's largest beer-producing company, approached the rival company SABMiller (SAB.L) on a takeover that would form a colossus that would produce a third of the world's total amount of beer.
Such a merger would have a market value of approximately $275 billion at current prices and would combine AB InBev' in Latin America with SABMiller in Africa, both representing markets with rapid development but also with their Asian breweries.
"The real attraction is Africa, where AB InBev is not present, but also a few places in Asia and Latin America," analyst Andrew Holland from the General Society said.
AB InBev and other top beer-producing companies are trying to enter new markets and strengthen their weaknesses in North America and Europe, where consumers increasingly prefer beer produced by independent players or wine or spirit drinks.
SABMiller, the second-world company and the producer of over 200 beer brands, including Peroni, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell, said on Wednesday that it was informed by AB InBev's intention to make an offer, which must happen by 14 October at the latest, according to British laws.
AB InBev, controlled by 3G Capital, a private capital fund administered by a group of Brazilian investors, confirmed the approach.
3G, renowned for its cost-cutting policy on marketing, previously orchestrated the purchase of Burger King, Ketchup Heinz (KHC.O) and Kraft Foods.
A close source of SAB mentioned that it's too early to say what it's going to do, because they didn't get any bids.
"At this point, we are waiting and deciding," said the source.
Speculations of a merger, which would very likely raise concerns about the breach of competition rules on markets such as the United States and China, have circulated for many years.
The time of the approach, after more than a decade of acquisitions made by AB InBev, follows a reduction of approximately 15% of the price of SABMiller shares from August onwards.
"It's exactly the moment they expected," said analyst Phil Gorham at Morningstar.
Financially, for the first time in many years, it makes sense.
AB InBev will have to pay at least 40 pounds (62 USD) per SAB Miller action, maybe even 45 pounds, according to analysts, which would mean a total price of up to 130 billion USD, which would also include the SABMiller debt.
This would make it the most significant M&A transaction of 2015, which is already announced a record year after the 2008 financial crisis in terms of the amount of the transaction, and one of the largest purchases since 1980 here.
The SAB shares approached 19.9% to 36.14 pounds, giving him a foreign capitalization of $90 billion.
AB InBev actions reached 6.4%.
Rivalii Heineken (HEIN.AS), Carlsberg (CARLb.CO) and Diageo (DGE.L) suspect that SAB could search for another fusion as defence strategies, as happened in the previous year when he offered to buy Heineken, but failed.
Since then, he has combined his African bottle bottle of cool drinks with that of Coca-Cola (KO.N), and in recent weeks there has been a suspicion of a combination of Diageo or Australian Coca-Cola Amatil (CCL.AX) drinks company.
The overall market share of AB InBev, Budweiser, Stella Artois and Corona, was 21.1% in 2014 while SABMiller was 15%, according to industry experts Plato Logic.
AB InBev intends a two-fold ratio between net debt and gross profit (EBITDA) from 2.5 of the present.
It is possible to achieve the objective in 2016, the most realistic date at which the transaction could be concluded, so that it would have how to borrow to finance an acquisition.
When he bought Budweiser's producer company, Anheuser-Busch, in 2008, with USD 52 billion, the largest purchase of ice money in history at that time. he let the report grow more than 5 times.
An equally large rise would allow them to accumulate a debt of 100 billion.
The families that control AB InBev own a little more than half of the company, while the two main shareholders of SABMiller are the producer of Altera (MO.N) cigarettes and the Santo Domingo family in Colombia.
On Wednesday, Altera refused to give statements about AB InBev's approach, but on 9 September, its financial director Billy Gifford said at an analysis conference that he regularly evaluates the investment in SABMiller and that "this time we believe that the maintenance of assets is in the interests of our shareholders".
The Santo Domingo family could not be contacted immediately for statements.
Neil Dwane, the head of European investment, fair, at Allianz Global Investors, who holds shares in both companies, says AB InBev has faced increasing pressure to return excess cash to shareholders.
ABI pays a very high price, but the accumulation of income from small debts reaches about 15% somewhere.
But we believe that the profit obtained from this acquisition would be a disappointing percentage, 8%, after 10 years," said Dwane.
In the case of any combination there are significant weights related to the infringement of competition rules, especially in the United States, where companies own about 70% of the beer market.
"The savings that could be made in distribution operations are large, and the obstacles to the breach of competition rules are even greater," said Erik Gordon, professor at Ross Business School at Michigan University.
Such a transaction would allow Molson Coors to obtain the 58 percent of the holding company owned by SABMiller, according to the operating agreement governing it.
A change in control at SABMiller would automatically give Molson the right to get another 8 percent and appoint a new executive director of the company.
Molson, based in Denver, would be entitled to the first and last bid for the remaining 50 percent.
A Molson spokesman refused to comment on whether the company was interested in an auction, but Molson’s shares increased by over 12 percent, to their highest value.
Any merger could also have to sell shares in China, where market leader is SABMiller’s CR Snow-participation association with China Resources (0291.HK).
Heineken, Carlsberg or Tsingtao from China could be potential buyers.
Plato estimates that the combined group could have a 28% share of the global market after the concessions.
AB InBev is advised by Lazard, and SABMiller is advised by Robey Warshaw, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley.
Pakistani police accuse a former Air Force pilot of helping Qaeda
Pakistani police arrested a former Air Force pilot who would later have donated funds to the Taliban and Al Qaeda, said police officers Wednesday for Reuters, in a rare case targeting those who help finance activism.
The suspect, Syed Sheaba Ahmed, was detained in the southern city of Karachi.
He paid for the treatment of wounded Taliban militants at a hospital in eastern Lahore, the police said.
It also influenced two militants involved in a May attack on a bus with members of the Muslim minority Israeli cities, after which 45 people died, said for journalists the senior police officer Naveed Khawaja of the Department for Combating Terrorism of the Province.
He will be accused of financing terrorism, Khawaja said.
"Ahmed has already funded the Afghan Taliban, we are still doing research to see if he has provided financial aid through his business or behind him is anyone else," said the officer.
“In addition, Ahmed has also provided financial aid for AQIS,” he said, referring to the Al Qaeda organization on the Indian Subcontinent, a branch of Al Qaeda founded a year ago.
This arrest is a rare success for Pakistani police forces, who face activism, corruption and murder.
After, in December, the Taliban rifles massacred about 150 people, mostly children, at an army school, the government swore to undermine activism.
Hard attacks have taken place, while the army has also moved more to tribal regions outside the law border with Afghanistan.
But militant groups remain a threat and many have supporters from Pakistani cities under the control of very weak police forces and insufficient funds.
Ahmed, 52 years old, used to preach at a mosque in the good area of the Karachi Army Housing Authority.
His public statements were moderate, but in particular, he encouraged radicalism, the police said.
He studied at the Pakistani Air Force College in Sargodha and left the Pakistani Air Force in 1998 said another security officer for Reuters under anonymity.
He subsequently entered the paint and chemical industry.
Rapper Rick Ross rejected his copyright application for "Everyday I'm hustlin"
New York rapper Rick Ross cannot claim copyright for the words "Everyday I'm hustlin'", decided an American judge, rejecting his complaint against the LMFAO musical group, who sold shirts with a similar verse, "Everyday I'm shufflin'".
In a decision published on Tuesday by the Federal Court of Miami, District Judge Kathleen Williams said that Ross' slogan, a prominent part of his 2006 debut hit, "Hustlin'", is a brief expression for which the courts have mentioned several times that he cannot receive copyright.
Williams' judgment weakens the copyright infringement process that Ross, whose real name is William Leonard Roberts II, tried against LMFAO in 2013.
Ross claimed that the Los Angeles electropop duet, composed of Stefan Gordy and Skyler Gordy, copied "Hustlin'" for their own 2010 famous song, "Party Rock Anthem", which contains the "Everyday I'm shufflin'" verse.
The hip hop star said that the LMFAO song is "an obvious attempt to capitalize on the fame and success of Hustlin'."
He also sued Kia Motors for the use of the "Party Rock Anthem" song in an advertising campaign.
In his complaint, Ross claimed that LMFAO violated his copyright by selling shirts and other products with the slogan shufflelin'.
In the judgment of Tuesday, Williams says that "Hustlin'", as a song, is protected by copyright law.
But Ross's three-word slogan is made up of ordinary words and can't have copyrights, she said.
The judge compared it with other famous lyrics from the past, such as "you got the right one, uh-huh", "holla back" and "we get it poppin'", saying that it is "a short expression, which all courts unanimously declared impossible to place under copyright".
The judge did not decide whether the song of the LMFAO band is an unauthorized copy of "Hustlin'".
The trial is scheduled for October.
Ross and LMFAO's lawyers could not be contacted immediately for statements.
The case is William L. Roberts, II et al. v. Stefan Kendal Gordy et al., U.S. District Court for Southern District, Florida, Nr.

Dr Carson is approaching Trump in the most recent presidential survey of the Republican Party
According to the most recent presidential poll for 2016, novice politician Ben Carson approaches the bomb leader Donald Trump in the preliminary Republican elections.
Carson got 17 points last month, while Jeb Bush dropped into seven-point polls.
After Trump's 27% support in the most recent CBS/New York Times poll, Carson, retired neurosurgeon, reaches second place with 23 percent, followed by Bush, by television star Mike Huckabee, by the senator of Florida Marco Rubio, each with 6 percent.
Support from Republican voters in the preliminary elections increased from early August to early September for Trump, Carson, Ohio Governor John Kasich and former Executive Director of Hewlett Packard, Carly Fiorina.
Support for the last two remains, however, at one-digit numbers.
Jeb Bush, former governor of Florida and the one who leads further the Bush family standards, dropped by seven percentage points in a month, while the governor of Wisconsin Scott Walker dropped by eight points.
In the last survey, Walker support is 2%.
Carson attracted greater support than Trump among college graduates (29% versus 21%), while Trump was ahead of Carson in the preferences of non-university graduates (30% versus 19%).
Trump is supported more by men than by women, while women prefer Rubio more than men.
37% of respondents to the poll said they were determined what candidate to support in the preliminary elections in their state.
Those who said I know who they're going to vote with twice as much support Trump as Carson.
It's still too early to say for 63% of Republican voters for the preliminary election.
The results of the CBS/NYT survey carried out between 9 and 13 September will be made public on Tuesday, before a presidential Republican debate.
Carson's rise in this survey reflects that of Senator Bernie Sanders in front of the leader for the nominating of the presidential Democrats, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
The last follow-up to the presidential nominations of CBS shows that Sanders rose by 10 points and by 22 points in Iowa, respectively, in New Hampshire, among the democratic voters for preliminary rulings.
A leading ethics specialist claims that sex robots should be banned
A leading ethics specialist in the robotics industry launched a campaign calling for a ban on the development of sex robots.
Dr. Kathleen Richardson, robotics expert at the University of Montfort in Leicester, England, warns that sex robots could contribute to the systematic dehumanization of women and children.
“Sexual thieves seem to be an increasingly important subject in the robotics industry, and the models they inspire – the way they will look, what roles they will have – are very disturbing,” she said to the BBC.
Richardson explains that her campaign against sex robots is not against sex, but against exploitation.
Technology is not neutral.
It is inspired by class, race and gender.
Political power inspires the development of technology," she said for Washington Post.
That's why we can do something about it.
These robots will contribute to increasing the degree of sexual exploitation.
Although the sex robots that are now making are still relatively primitive, Richardson is concerned that they are the first step towards something more sinister.
It's a new and emerging technology, but we have to stop it in front of us.
Surely, the industry seems to be moving forward.
A few years ago, the inflatable doll producer True Companion launched Roxxxy, the "first sex robot in the world".
However, concern about the possible high dangers of artificial intelligence is not unusual, even among the great representatives of industry.
Just this spring, executive director of Tesla Motors Elon Musk wrote about “the risk that something really dangerous will happen in five years.
In an interview with the BBC last December, physicist and cosologist Stephen Hawking warned that "development of complete artificial intelligence could mean the end of the human race".
UK welcomes the first refugees from Syria - RT UK
The following days, Great Britain will receive the first refugees who fled the Syrian war, announced internal minister Theresa May.
They will receive assistance under the extended government resettlement programme.
Refugees seeking asylum arrive from camps on the border with the country torn by war.
These are the first of the 20,000 refugees that the United Kingdom plans to receive by 2020.
In a speech in the House of Commons, the Minister of Internal Affairs said the government is "working fast" to ensure more arrivals.
In the process of receiving vulnerable refugees in the United Kingdom, it is imperative to be already developed the assistance and support they need and deserve.
I know that honourable members and the general public want to learn more about the number of persons and the date on which they are expected to arrive.
May mentioned that the government must make further plans to ensure that refugees have adequate supplies when arriving.
I must point out that the level of enlargement requires careful and meticulous planning, to ensure that everything goes smoothly.
The Syrian refugee minister Richard Harrington and I will continue to keep the Chamber informed on this matter.
But I am delighted to tell the Chamber that we are waiting to welcome the first wave of refugees in the coming days and work quickly to plan more arrivals in the weeks to come.
Prime Minister David Cameron drew his anger to parliamentarians and militants when he unveiled the plan for government refugees, many of whom felt that the figure was too small.
In September, Cameron told the House of Commons that the United Kingdom “will rise to its high moral responsibility” and will receive 20,000 refugees from the Middle East camps until the next general election.
He added that refugees will not automatically receive full asylum, but a humanitarian status that will allow them to apply for asylum after five years.
But critics noted that the figures meant only 12 refugees a day, and former Liberal MP Paddy Ashdown said the measures were "distortion".
Further, Ashdown revealed that children included in this scheme are to be deported when they are 18 years old if they do not receive asylum.
Important public figures and figures have also condemned measures.
In a joint letter, big names such as Benedict Cumberbatch, Colin Firth, Jamie Oliver and Keira Knightley said the response to the crisis is "too little, too late".
"It is a responsibility that must be shared with our European neighbours, not simply thrown on the shoulders of countries close to conflicts that drive people out of their homes," they wrote.
Rubla is recovering from global insecurity - RT Business
Russian rouble was strengthened on Wednesday, being traded 65.66 against the US dollar and 73.98 against the euro at the Moscow Stock Exchange at 10:00 GMT.
In general, the Russian currency won seven percent from its lowest rate of 71 rubles for a dollar on 24 August.
Analysts say that the return of the rouble was due to the investor's reaction to the current global market disturbances produced by China's weights, the possible increase in the interest rate of the US Federal Reserve and the exaggerated reaction to cheap oil.
Brent rates increased by 61 cents on Wednesday, reaching $48.36 per barrel.
West Texas Intermediate (WTI) traded 72 cents more, at $45.31 per barrel.

"It is possible that volatility will say its word, fuelled by insecurity in China and at the time of growth in the federal interest rate, which will continue to give the tone for oil and rubble prices," said Bloomberg Piotr Matys from Rabobak, expert in monetary policy strategies on emerging markets, established in London.
Experts also indicate another factor that explains the strengthening of the Russian currency.
The main Russian oil companies Lukoil and Rosneft, whose contracts are related to the US dollar, began to buy ruble.
The global markets await the decision of the Federal Reserve on Thursday with their soul in their mouth, whether or not it will increase the interest rate.
Markets believe that what could be the first increase in the US interest rate in nine years will not happen and traded at higher rates on Wednesday.
Nasa and the United Kingdom work together on the drone traffic system
NASA is already working with the US government and with companies such as Google, Amazon and Verizon telephony company to develop a database that allows drone pilots to reserve airspace blocks for flights.
Nothing has yet been established at EU level.
Collaboration comes as a result of a widespread anxiety about the possibility of an air collision between small drones and commercial aircraft.
A new Forrester report describes in vivid colors the potential negative effect.
“Imagine thousands of drones operated by hundreds of companies delivering products or capturing data in high-density urban areas such as New York City, Chicago or San Francisco,” the research notes.
Without a common set of technological protocols and air rules, chaos could be installed.
According to Detta O'Cathain, Baroness of the House of Lords, the concern has grown on the bottom of the reports on events at the limit of an accident and drone operation above the football stadiums, near the nuclear power stations and the Eiffel Tower.
"Over the past two years, more than 400 calls made to the metropolitan police have been related to drone incidents," said O'Cathain.
Which is the solution: building a system that tracks all drones, especially those flying at a height less than 150 meters, regardless of whether they are driven by commercial or amateur pilots.
“As more and more small drones operate commercial flights at low altitudes beyond the level of visibility of the pilot, or even completely autonomous flights, a certain air traffic management infrastructure is required to separate flights in order to ensure the safety of complex operations, such as the delivery of parcels to cities,” she said.
According to Nasa, this drone traffic management system will include services such as air space design, methods to avoid unfavourable weather and wind conditions, congestion management, road planning and redirection by methods similar to the rules established for road traffic, such as signalling and tapes.
They are expected to have a functional prototype by 2019.
The drone industry is going to explode in the European Union over the next few years.
"We already see small and innovative EMS companies in the United Kingdom that use this technology with significant effects in the energy, agriculture and media industries," says Lord Tariq.
More than 670 permits for commercial drone operations were granted only in the United Kingdom by the Civil Aviation Authority in 2014.
The European Commission estimates that the drone industry could generate 150 000 jobs in the EU by 2050.
Dislike Button: Why Does Facebook Want to Know What Hurts You
"A Look Back" works similarly, gathering the most important moments (on Facebook).
But what will that mean for the many users inside the virtual borders of Facebook, who are now more than the population of any country?
First of all, of course, a empathy button will allow Facebook to understand you better.
The huge amount of Facebook - approximately US$ 240 billion after the last statistics - is due to the amount of unexpected data about consumers it owns.
Each interaction, posting, appreciation and friendship you make are gathered and build a remarkable image of complexity, located in a permanent update, about your person and about your preferences.
This is valuable primarily for advertising agencies, who can use all this information to carefully choose which people to see their ads on Facebook by selecting those who are most interested in their products.
An empathy button adds another set of data and certainly opens a door for another type of advertising agents to use the platform.
While a sports company is looking for people who “appreciate” a national football team, charitable organisations and promoters want to address those who, for example, “empathize” with the refugee crisis.
It will also probably change what you see on News.
Facebook uses incredibly intelligent and sophisticated algorithms to restrict that vast universe of content you could see, in the smallest stream you actually see.
This algorithm depends essentially on what you considered interesting in the past and especially on what you liked.
Undoubtedly, there is on Facebook fear that many interesting posts, but unhappy ones do not enter the algorithm, because people do not feel that they should appreciate them.
However, if Facebook understands more about what upsets you or makes you feel unhappy, it could make the decision to delete this kind of posts from News.
Facebook has carried out experiments in the past to understand how what you see at News affects your emotional state and, in particular, how this is transmitted from one person to another.
The representatives of the academic environment call this "emotional contamination" and, although it sounds sinister, it is probably just a simple attempt of Facebook (and published open with their consent) to better understand how their platform works and whether they can adjust algorithms to distribute several elements.
What will happen with the empathy button remains at Facebook latitude.
The really exciting thing is how the decision of one company to add a single button to its services can produce so much speculation.
The reason for this may be that the decisions made by Facebook - whether it involves the visible buttons that we see or the invisible algorithms that work hidden - have profound consequences on us today.
Now we spend a significant part of life in the digital world, which we access to to find anything, from love to comfort or a new job.
On the other hand, Facebook is a company and another one that carries on a constant struggle for survival in the fierce Darwinian world of technology and social networks.
The decisions they make, including new buttons, will be considered the most appropriate to remain on the surface in this race.
I think a lot of people can empathize with this and soon they'll also have a button for this.
Biometric bracelets can anticipate crises in people with autism
During ten years of research in America, Dr. Goodwin and his team have established that body signals can anticipate these changes, sometimes violent, before they occur, thus giving the assistants an opportunity to take appropriate measures.
The autism kids we work with can't tell us what's going on.
I can't say that his head hurts or that "here's too much noise" or "I don't like this teacher."
If we want to understand them, we need to see what their body transmits to us, and we need to do this in a gentle and unintrusive way.
For example, simple viewing of colors in an application can show the level of agitation. Red can be used to warn about a change of behavior, and blue for lack of interest, giving the assistant an understanding that the person is bored and needs stimulation.
The data from the bracelets can be collected in time and saved on a secure server, helping caregivers understand the overall picture of how the person responds to different situations and would be the most appropriate intervention.
I have to say very clearly that we don't read the mind.
Biometric sensors are not magic. They need a man to be interpreted.
He added that his team would work with producers to further develop this technology, to be specific for autism.
The research was appreciated by Jane Carolan, director of customer services at Wirral Austistic Society, who will present technology at the Autech 2015 conference on autism and technology at Manchester on 1 October.
When you work with people who suffer from severe autism, as we do, you see the spectacular difference that can bring in their life care technology. Now, apps for iPad give themselves a voice to people who have never spoken.
The robots help the autistic children learn to play by hiding.
"Who knows where this innovation could lead us," she says.
Assistance technologies can truly change life and we feel that they are part of our mission, as a charitable organization for autism, to ensure that everyone has access to this information and are also part of the debate on how we want to support people with autism in the future.
France will attack Isis in Syria "in the weeks to come"
In the following weeks, French warplanes will launch air strikes on Isis targets in Syria, announced the government on Wednesday, just a few days after President François Hollande declared the intervention as a "necessary".
France will conduct its first air strikes on the Islamic State jihadist group in Syria "in the following weeks," said Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian on Wednesday.
The French air forces are carrying out recognition missions in Syria on 8 September, and the attacks will follow "the following weeks, as soon as we have clearly identified targets," Le Drian said for the France Inter radio station.
Le Drian said Tuesday in parliament that the Islamic State has made "very significant progress" in Syria, especially in the northern Aleppo region.
“In the town of the Sea there is an extremely strong offensive, and if it succeeds, it could destroy what we still call the Free Syrian Army or the Syrian National Coalition or what remains of it,” he said.
France is part of a US-led coalition that has been bombing Isis positions in Iraq for a year, but Hollande changed the strategy last week to extend its actions in Syria, under conditions under which political pressure accumulates at the heart of the jihadist threat facing France.
The United States of America, Canada, Turkey and the Gulf States have already been involved in attacks on Isis militants in Syria.
The feature of blocking the ads in iOS 9 will make the phone even faster
The newest version of iOS 9 is released on Wednesday and contains many new features.
One of the most useful for iPhone owners - and worrying for online editors - is the ability to easily block ads during web browsing.
The new function will allow users to download third-party extensions that block cookies, ads, pop-up windows and other types of advertising while using the Safari browser mobile version of Apple.
At the test, it turned out that after the ad is blocked, news sites like New York Times are loading twice as fast as they can, according to Reuters.
It also helps users to maintain the use of data and battery autonomy.
Users will benefit from several advertising locking options, including 1Locker, Blockr and Crystal applications.
AdBlock Plus, a popular desktop advertising locking tool, has launched its own iOS web browser that limits ads; its creator intends to launch an extension for Safari in the future.
People who use software to block commercials receive some constraints.
Ads are still displayed in applications (this is where Apple earns money on iOS).
More and more media sites, including Hulu and The Washington Post, are trying to prevent their visitors from using such advertising blocking features.
However, their use on desktop computers increased to almost 48% in the previous year.
Their development raises great challenges for the online media, which is largely offered to consumers free of charge and is supported by advertising for many years.
One report says that blocking ads could cost online publishers nearly 22 billion in advertising revenues only this year.
In order to enable locking ads in iOS 9, users need to download an application for locking ads, then access Settings -> Safari -> Content Blockers to activate an extension for blocking content.
Obama talks about terrorism and the crisis of immigrants with the king of Spain
President Barack Obama welcomed King Philip VI of Spain to the White House on Tuesday, where the two discussed various subjects, but probably reduced to the importance of international cooperation.
Obama and the king have addressed the subject of the fight against the Islamic State and the growing crisis of immigrants in Europe - which has already faced hundreds of thousands of people who have left their country of origin to go west.
"Spain has tried very hard to cope with this problem in the past, with North African immigrants who are often involved in very dangerous travel, and the problem of human trafficking," Obama said.
Of course, the problem has worsened in recent months.
Obama also stressed the importance of cooperation, especially in the context of the Spanish territory of Catalonia voting in the elections that will take place this month.
"With regard to foreign policy, we have committed ourselves firmly to maintaining relations with a strong and united Spain," Obama said.
The Supreme Commander also told King Felipe that he would like to visit his country before the end of his term in 2017.
"We welcome you with open arms," Felipe replied.
The first lady, Michelle Obama, made the queen a tour of the White House and had a talk at the tea.
That was the first visit of the royal couple to the United States from the throne climb.
After they left Washington, they were about to make a visit to South Florida.
Alfre Woodard joins the "Luce Cage" series team
The famous actress Alfre Woodard joined the distribution of the future Netflix Luke Cage series from Marvel. She will be antagonist to Mike Colter, who plays the role of the superhero who gives the title to the series.
Woodard will play the role of Mariah Dillard - "a local politician from Harlem and cousin of the character Cornell "Cottonmouth" Stokes recently announced, played by Mahershala Ali - who intends to bring about an era of change on the streets that he has grown," says a press release.
Her personal life and professional career are given over by Harlem's newest hero, Luke Cage, but also by her cousin Cottonmouth's infamous actions.
"Alfre has an incredible, unique and intimidating presence on screen, which makes it perfect for the leadership role of the community in Harlem," says Jeph Loeb, executive producer and Marvel Television president.
We are delighted that an actress as famous and talented as Alfre agreed to join us in this adventure.
The series will be premiered in 2016.
Cheo Hodari Coker will write the first two episodes and work as a showrunner and executive producer.
Woodard, aged 62, is known for the TV series Hill Street Blues, St. Elsewhere, L.A. Law, Desperate Neveste and Law firm, but also for the movies Devil's Advocate, Mysterious Obsession, The Family That Preys, 12 years of slavery and Annabelle.
Luke Cage is one of four Marvel series from the Netflix franchise.
Also, Jessica Jones and Iron Fist will soon be broadcast, but also the second season in Daredevil.
"Scream Queens" and "Empire" have the world premiere on the same day
Fox predicts many positive results ahead of the premieres of two of his most expected series: Screen Queens and Empire.
The first season in Queens and the second season in Empire will be broadcast on all Fox International channels one day after the internal premiere.
As Variety reports, the strategy is a trend applied to high-profile series, as traffic in global social networks ensures success.
"Hollywood realizes how important it is to value the common voice of sincere international fans, especially for the series that is talked about very much, such as Empire and Screen Queens," said President Fox International, Hernan Lopez, according to Deadline.
"We look forward to broadcast these very interesting series for fans around the world," Lopez continued.
The viewers we serve each day bring the success of a series at the premiere and throughout its life cycle.
The next season in the Empire, where they will play famous celebrities such as Mariah Carey and Vivica A. Fox, is premiered in September.
The new Screen Queens series, in which Emma Roberts and Ariana Grande will be played, will be broadcast the next day in September.
Members of the British Royal Family will participate in the World premiere of the film "Spectre"
Prince Harry and the Dukes and Duchess of Cambridge will participate in London next month in the world premiere of the most recent film with James Bond, "Spectre".
The Kensington Palace announced the news on Wednesday on Twitter, appointing the premiere as Royal Film Performance for Cinema and Television Benevolent Fund.
According to a press release by producers, “Spectre” is the third Bond film chosen as RFP since 1946 here.
In the past, for royal premieres have been selected and "Don't Die Today" (2002) and Casino Royale (2006).
This year's event takes place on October 26th at Royal Albert Hall in London and will be a charitable one, after which they will benefit from the British film and television industry's backstage employees.
Also at the premiere will participate actors in the distribution of the film, including lead actor Daniel Craig, Christoph Waltz, Lea Seydoux, Ben Whishaw, Naomie Harris, David Bautista, Monica Bellucci and Ralph Fiennes.
Director Sam Mendes and producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson will also go on the red carpet with members of the royal family.
"Spectre" will be broadcast in U.S. cinemas in November.
There are rumors that Christie Brinkley and John Mellencamp would be together
The model Christie Brinkley and musician John Mellencamp were seen on Monday having dinner together, stirring up the rumor that the two would have a romantic relationship.
The two met to have dinner at Bowery Hotel in New York City, where the photographers surprised Brinkley cheerful and smiling.
The 61-year-old Supermodel was seen wearing jeans, tennis and a yellow jacket, while the 63-year-old rock star was dressed in broken jeans, coat and boots.
Last year, in October, Mellencamp would have been seen again with his girlfriend who is parting and with whom she is constantly reconciled, actress Meg Ryan.
Mellencamp praised the message star for you at the NBC Today show, saying he was "an angel who sent me and I'm very happy."
He added that "nothing will end until it ends."
In August, Brinkley's youngest daughter, Sailor Brinkley Cook, posed for Seventeen's magazine, trampling on her mother's tracks.
Arctic mosquitoes are large enough to hit a karibu
Many studies have highlighted species that have become more vulnerable due to the warmer climate, but global warming has proved a benefit to others.
One of these advantageous species is Arctic mosquito.
According to researchers at Dartmouth College, warmer temperatures in the Arctic region allowed mosquitoes here to appear earlier and grow larger, leading to the development of their population.
In a new study, researchers at the John Sloan Dickey Center for International Understanding at Dartmouth, experts in the Arctic region, used their field observations to illustrate the effects of temperature changes on Arctic mosquitoes.
Their analysis anticipates a 50% increase in the survival rate of adult mosquitoes under 2 degrees Celsius of temperature.
Tancers are small, but they are important members of the Arctic and ecosystem trophic chain.
The new analysis - detailed in a new work published in the Processings of the Royal Society B - aims to help biologists anticipate better how a growing population of mosquitoes could affect the caribou they feed with, the birds and insects that feed with them and the plants they pollinate.
To build their demonstration, Dartmouth scientists combined their field results with laboratory experiments that investigated how the temperature influences insect development and the predisposition to be hunted by predators.
While increasing temperatures make larger mosquitoes more vulnerable to coleopters, it also gives them an early start in the spring and makes the development of their larvae faster and more efficient, which is certainly an advantage.
More mosquitoes means a larger population, which can be developed but only to the extent that they can support insect food sources.
The ability of mosquitoes to transform their improved survival rate into an improved reproductive rate depends on their ability to ensure their blood for food.
Antidepressants taken during pregnancy do not affect the child
Three new studies show that the administration of antidepressants in pregnant women has no effect on the neuronal or behavioral development of their children.
Studies have shown that selective inhibitors of serotonin recovery (SSRI) have an increased risk of postpartum bleeding, but researchers have said that depression is an even greater risk for women and their children, which is why it should be treated.
"These studies add to an increasing set of evidence regarding the safety of antidepressant administration during pregnancy," said a press release John Thorp, Deputy Editor-in-Chief of the International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, who published all three studies.
Although there are some increased risks, so far the evidence seems to show that the risks of untreated depression are higher than those of antidepressants administration.
The Norwegian Institute for Public Health coordinated a study on the motor development of children whose mothers were treated with SSRI, analyzing the data of 51,404 children in the Norwegian cohort study of mother and child, investigating the effects of SSRI on the development of motor skills at 3 years of age.
Researchers found that 381 mothers had used SSRI during pregnancy, and 159 of them had been treated with drugs for a prolonged period.
Although exposure to SSRI was associated to some extent with a delay in engine development, researchers wrote in the study that the association “was not so significant as to give delay a clinical importance”.
A group of researchers from Adelaide University in Australia conducted an examination of data for 49 000 women from Danish national birth cohort to discover the effects of SSRI administration on children's behaviour up to 7 years of age.
The study found that uncontrolled depression in pregnant women was associated with an increased risk of behavioural problems.
Of 210 children whose mothers had been treated against SSRI depression, there was no increased risk of behavioral problems compared to the 231 children who were more prone to behaviour issues such as hyperactivity, lack of attention and socialization problems.
The same group of Australian researchers also found in a separate study that mothers are more prone to bleeding after birth if treated with SSRI.
Analysis of medical data from 30,198 who were born at a university hospital in Adelaide between 2002 and 2008 showed that the risk of postnatal bleeding increased by 5% between 11 and 16% if women were treated with SSRI.
The risk of severe bleeding or postnatal anaemia has doubled, researchers reported.
Researchers said that although the study linked the administration of high-risk SSRIs, there are a large number of variables - from medicines taken during birth to the limited amount of information obtained by researchers about women's specific medical conditions - which could have had an effect on the potential for bleeding.
"It is possible for women who have taken antidepressants at an advanced stage of pregnancy to have been those with the most serious stage of the disease, and this is the reason for the increased risk of postnatal bleeding, not antidepressants," says Dr. Luke Grzeskowiak, professor at Adelaide University.
Only on the basis of this study do we recommend that women stop taking medicines against depression during pregnancy, but be closely monitored to reduce the risk of potential bleeding as much as possible.
Matthew is charged with murder in the case of the murder of a student from Virginia Technical University
The man charged with the murder of Hannah Graham from Virginia University was charged with a qualified murder in the case of a student from Virginia Technical University missing in 2009, announced Tuesday the authorities.
The great jury in Albimarle, Virginia, charged Jesse Leroy Matthew Jr., aged 33, in Charlottesville, on Friday for the murder of Morgan Harrington, tell the officials.
Matthew is also accused of kidnapping with intent to rape.
Each head of charge receives maximum life imprisonment.
Harrington, 20-year-old, disappeared from a concert in Charlottesville in 2009, and her body was discovered three months later.
Her parents say the news of the indictment brought them relief.
"For six years we have been working hard and unbeatable for this purpose," says Gil Harrington, Morgan's mother.
I'm thrilled to know that when you take someone's life, you have to bear the consequences for your doing.
For Jesse Matthew, the dominoes of the consequences began to be laid down.
Police say there is a medical-legal link between Harrington, Graham cases and a 2005 sexual abuse in Fairfax County.
In June, Matthew was found guilty for the latter and awaits the sentence in this case.
He's in jail in Charlottesville.
Jesse Matthew accused of a qualified murder in case of the death of a student from Virginia University
Harrington had gone to U-Va on October 17, 2009, together with friends, to a metal concert.
The group separated when Harrington came out of John Paul Jones Arena from Charlottesville to go to the bathroom and couldn't come back.
Last time she was seen trying to take a taxi around 20:30 in front of the arena.
Harrington was dressed in a black shirt with Panthera band.
After her disappearance, Harrington's purse and mobile phone were found in the arena parking lot.
Family and friends started an extensive search for Harrington, a graduate of pedagogical studies, who wanted to become a teacher. Metallica wrote about her disappearance on their website.
In November 2009, the shirt he wore was found next to a chain of apartments in Charlottesville.
Then, in January 2010, her body was discovered in an isolated chain, in a farm in southwestern Charlottesville.
During the time of Harrington's disappearance, Matthew worked as a taxi driver in Charlottesville, but it's not clear whether that period overlapped with the date Harrington disappeared.
Police say that a significant advance in the Harrington case was represented by Matthew's arrest in the case of Graham's disappearance last year.
Officials who knew the investigation said these cases were linked by DNA evidence.
The investigators did not at this time publicize the details of the new evidence that led Matthew to be charged with Harrington's murder.
Defense attorney Douglas Ramseur, who represents Matthew in Graham's case, refused to give statements.
Announcement of the indictment comes two days after the one-year anniversary of Hannah Graham's disappearance in September.
This case is similar to the Harrington case: both were young students who disappeared when they left town in Charlottesville.
Graham, aged 18, from Fairfax County, was seen walking with Matthew in a mall in the centre near U-Va campus.
Matthew was arrested for that case a few weeks later after a national search.
Graham's body was found in October.
In July, Matthew will be tried for qualified murder in Graham's case.
In the first days after Graham's disappearance last fall in Charlottesville, Gil Harrington represented a constant presence at the meetings and vistas organized for the missing student from U-Va.
Harrington says she endured for her daughter speculations and media critics who must be silenced by the new charges against Matthew.
"During this time there have also been discussions such as "Why were we wearing a short skirt?" and "And looking for it with candle?" but this kind of question and judgment are not valid when it is clear that we are dealing with a predator on the tracks of the hunt," added Harrington.
In the case of Fairfax County, Matthew was convicted of sexual assault against a young woman in 2005.
The woman, who was 26 years old at the time of the attack, told the jury that one September evening while she was walking home from the store, a stranger came after her.
He took her to a versified area, beat her and held her by her neck, then attacked her sexually.
"I thought the end came to me, that I had to scream incessantly," the woman confessed.
I was afraid I'd die.
Matthew suddenly took her away, said the woman.
A prosecutor told the jury that Matthew might have been scared by the lights of a car entering a nearby parking lot.
He was convicted years later after the DNA tests linked him to this case.
Matthew will get his sentence in October.
Matthew will come to trial for the first time in the Harrington case in Charlottesville on Wednesday afternoon.
Dan Harrington, Morgan's father, said he'd most likely come to Charlottesville on Wednesday and visit the bridge where his daughter was last seen.
"A little bit, I've taken a step today," says Dan Harrington.
Is Jon Snow dead or not?
Actor Kit Harington gives us a clue
Actor Kit Harington gave an important clue to the fate of the character or the series Games of Thrones, Jon Snow, who was killed at the end of season four.
In an interview with the Dutch magazine Humo, he said he knew the duration of the contract or the HBO post, according to Digital Spy.
Asked in a few more seasons, he said he couldn't talk about it.
Let's just say that the show will be part of my life for some time, I'll probably be over 30 years when it's over.
But one thing is certain.
"When I leave the Games of Thrones, then will be the moment when I bury myself in film-long film projects," said the actor.
The series comes back on small screens in the spring of next year.
The Fans Games of Thrones triggered a hysteria after the end of season four, when the character Jon Snow was stabbed and launched several theories, according to which he will somehow be brought back to life.
Moreover, the Romans created an event on Facebook, called Jon Snow's "Pomana" 40 days after the end of the season, which has dragged over 36,000 supporters.
Good news for Romania from the European Commission
The European Commission decided on Tuesday to resume payments for Romania under the "Economic Competitiveness" and "Media" programmes, both interrupted at the beginning of April 2015.
According to a communication from the representative of Romania of the European Commission, following this decision, approximately EUR 120 million will be transferred to the Roman authorities in the immediate period.
I am pleased to announce the release of these payments and appreciate the efforts made by the Roman authorities to improve management and control systems within the two programmes.
It is important that the Roman authorities have been involved in identifying weaknesses and solving problems.
"I am hopeful that the measures taken will significantly reduce the risk of errors and irregularities in the future," said the European Commissioner for Regional Policy, Corina Crete.
"The extremist statements made by Mr. Gianni Pitella are incorrect," the chief of Hungarian diplomacy reacted.
Peter Szijjarto asked European Socialists to stop "the campaign of lies" in Hungary.
Referring to the statements made by Harlem Desire, French Secretary of State for European Affairs, on the fence built by Hungary, Szijjarto stressed that Budapest "maintains a common European immigration strategy", while insisting that national borders should be protected.
Romania wants to hit the rugby World

"We want two victories, with the teams of Canada and Italy," Mihai Macovei, captain of Romania said.

Refugee crisis: JHA without any solution
European Council President Donald Tusk announced that on Thursday he would take a decision on the possible convening of a European Union Summit on Migration in Europe.
German chancellor Angela Merkel and Austrian counterpart Werner Faymann called for a European Union summit on Tuesday to resolve the refugee crisis.
At a joint press conference in Berlin, Merkel said that Germany, Austria and Sweden cannot handle the refugee crisis alone.
The head of the German executive expressed his support for the recent decision taken by Berlin to impose border controls in the face of massive influx of asylum seekers, mentioning that the measure is intended to facilitate the registration of refugees.
In turn, Slovakia - which opposes the European Commission's proposal to redistribute refugees between Member States on the basis of compulsory quotas - has decided to organise an extraordinary EU summit.
EU Interior Ministers, meeting Monday evening in Brussels, failed to adopt the new proposal for the urgent redeployment of 120,000 refugees between the Member States of the European Union, presented on 9 September by the European Commission.
The first point of the plan, represented by the emergency relocation mechanism for refugees, provides for the rapid redeployment of 54,000 refugees in Hungary, 50,400 in Greece and 15,500 in Italy.
Charlie Hebdo, we controversial cartoons
The French satirical publication Charlie Hebdo again provokes controversy, after the publication of cartoons that mock the answer of the predominantly Christian European countries to the wave of immigrants from the predominantly Muslim countries affected by the war.
In the most recent issue of the article, the publication drew attention again, as well as critics on social networks, writes the agency Reuters.
One of the drawings infatuates a compelling image of Aylan Kurdi, the drowned Syrian boy, whose body reached one of the beaches of Turkey, after a failed attempt to cross the sea by boat, by his family, from Syria to Greece.
Charlie Hebdo's drawing shows a baby in shorts and shirts, with face down on the grand stage, next to a billboard offering two children's menus at the price of one.
"So close to succeed," is the message accompanying the drawing.
Another drawing, also the work of a cartoonist who survived the attack at the editorial office in Paris in January, is accompanied by the message "Prove that Europe is a Christian".
The drawing presents a character like Jesus, who goes on the water, while a smaller character wears short trousers with his feet up into the water, first saying "Christians go on the water", takes the second "Muslim children drown".
The French magazine became a symbol of freedom of expression, after an attack by Islamist militants in January, following repeated threats after the mocking of Muhammad.
A chain of supermarkets present in Romania, dramatically amended in Russia
The French chain of Auchan supermarkets was amended by more than $370,000 by Russian officials, being charged with food safety violations.
Anna Popova, head of the Russian consumer protection agency Rospotrebnadzor, said the fines total over 25 million rubles, i.e. 372,000 dollars, relates the Associated Press agency, quoted by US News.
But the reasons why these fines were granted were not specified, and Auchan made no comment.
The French chain of supermarkets is also the target of the Russian agricultural agency's accusations, which claims that some meat products have been detected as infested with bacteria such as E.coli and Listeria.
Food controls come within a period of tension between France and Russia, on the extension of the sanctions of the European Union and the decision of France to cancel an agreement on the supply of Mistral Russian ships.
The Roman Ministry of Foreign Affairs reacted to the news that Hungary could raise a metal fence at the border with our country.
MAE appears to have been briefly informed about this decision and that it is not a fair political gesture.
MAE shows, in a submission to the newspaper.com, that it was informed by the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs about this intention shortly before it was announced.
In its turn, MAE informed in due course the relevant decision-making factors in Romania in relation to this situation.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs considers that raising a fence between two Member States of the European Union and which are strategic partners is not a fair political gesture, in accordance with the European spirit.
This position has already been communicated to the Hungarian party, it appears in the communiqué.
Hungary plans to build a metal fence on a border segment with Romania, in the context of the immigration crisis, said Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto, quoted by Mediafax on Tuesday.
"The measure is necessary for smugglers of persons transiting Serbia to change their routes, and there is a likelihood that they will head for Romania," the head of the Hungarian diplomacy explained.
"The garden would start from the border point of Hungary/Serbia/Romania and continue a reasonable distance if the pressure of migration moves to Romania," Szijjarto explained.
At the end of August, the press reported that extra-Community immigrants transiting Serbian territory on their way to the European Union were trying to bypass the fence built by the Hungarian authorities through its eastern end at the common border between Serbia, Hungary and Romania.
In this context, extra-Community immigrants have discovered that they can wander around the fence through the area of the villages Majdan/Rade (Serbia) - Beba Veche (Timis, Romania) - Kubekhaza (Hungary).
The Hungarian government has allocated 22.2 billion forks (71.8 million euros) for the construction of a controversial metal fence at the border with Serbia, over a distance of 175 kilometres, and for the special centres needed for immigrants' homes.
The guard's initiative is criticized by the European Union and Serbia.
No need, he'll stay there.
The unscrupulous body of Cornelius Vadim Tudor will not be deposited in the Senate of Romania, despite the desire expressed by the widow of the politician.
According to a statement delivered by Diare.com, the Permanent Bureau of the Senate discussed, Tuesday, a request by Mrs. Vadim Tudor, on the approval of the uninscrupulous body of former Senator Cornelius Vadim Tudor at the Senate headquarters.
"From receipt of this letter until the moment of analysis, in the Permanent Bureau, the insubstantial body has already been deposited at a cult lake and will remain there, the Permanent Bureau appreciating that there is no need to be moved from there to the Senate of Romania," the Senate says.
Senator PNL Teodor Atanasiu argued that this request "does not agree with Romania's geographical position somewhere in Europe".
Also, Agerpres, the senators held a moment of gathering in memory of the former PRM leader, on the proposal of Senator UNPR Serb Michaelescu.
Corneliu Vadim Tudor died on Monday evening around 18:30.
PRM President passed inconsistencies at the Army's Emergency Clinic of Cardiovascular Diseases.
The Euronament will be buried Thursday from 12:00, at the Ghencea cemetery, and will have military honors.
Are refugees coming to Romania?
Mayors of border localities, questions about accommodation places
Mayors in the border localities of Arad County are questioned by Police and Border Police, these days, about the places of accommodation for possible refugees who may reach Romania, but also for gendarmi, if they will be mobilized to the border.
The building of Nadlac, Vasile Ciceac, said he had meetings on this subject.
Discussions were conducted with farmers in the area, who were asked to report on the presence of any foreigners near the border.
We had discussions with border police, national police and local police, as well as farmers in the area.
We all need to be more vigilant in the next period.
"I have asked the farmers, who have work during this period on arable land, to be careful and report any movement," the Edil said.
The immigration crisis in Hungary: Shields and water cannons on the border
He, like other mayors in the Hungarian border area, said that the police requested information on the places of accommodation available in the event of confrontation with a wave of refugees.
We were asked how many people we can hunt.
We don't have refugee spaces in our commune.
We believe that such special centres do not even have to appear at the border, because they are more difficult to control here, migrants being tempted to flee, because they are not interested in staying in Romania.
It would be best to set up such centres in areas beyond the border," said the mayor of the municipality of Iratosu, Papp Atila Iosif.
In turn, the mayor of Doobanti, Vincentiu Almasi, said he was asked about both places of accommodation for refugees and intervention forces, in case they would be mobilized in the area.
The police were interested if we could hunt the gendarmes.
We could find places on the Cultural Road, but for refugees we have no possibility of accommodation.
"We have been questioned about the length of the Hungarian border, probably working on an action plan," Vincentiu Almasi said.
He added that at the local police station, "starting Tuesday, since Hungary sealed its border with Serbia, it has established itself permanently".
"There's always a cop at the station, and the locals know they have to inform if they notice any strangers in the area," the Edil said.
Pilu Mayor's representatives said they could cause as many as a hundred people on the Cultural Road, the information being provided to the police at their request.
Also, Mayor of Curtici, Nicolae Aanitea, said there are accommodation spaces in the former headquarters of local public financiers, but here are necessary arrangements.
Also, a former Border Police barracks could be arranged to host refugees.
The representatives of the Arad County Police Press Office did not offer an opinion on the question of mayors during this period, confirming only that "in the border localities of Arad County, patrol activities have been intensified".
Army Club Commander Announces Radical Measures Against Becali's Star
Commander of the Army Sports Club, Colonel George Boroi, announced a series of radical measures to be taken against Gigi Becali's Star.
Although both sides have negotiated a package, Boroi maintains that the Army will have its own football team, which will take over the historical palm of the "ros-blues".
The team that won the Champions Cup is in the break for now.
"It's not a historic break, it's just a competitive break, because we don't have the team, but things can change from next year," Boroi said at Sport.ro.
At the same time, he announces that the process of requesting damage from Becali's team will continue.
The period we refer to by decision of the ICCJ is very clear.
We need to recover the damage from the FC Stara, the team that used the Stara brand without the acceptance of its own - i.e. CSA Stara.
It appears very clear and the continuity of the section, which was actually permanent of the Army Club.
"So the Bucharest Star football team, in one form or another, but in a legal form, must exist as a continuation of the perfumes it has so far in its palms," says George Boroi.
The star of Becali and the Army Club was in open war since the end of last year, when the supreme court decided that the military were the ones holding the "Star".

The region that "chooses" millionaires
Millions in Asia-Pacific will form this year the group of the richest people in the world, thanks to the assets accumulated in China and India, shows a study published on Wednesday by Capgemini and RBC Wealth Management.
According to this document, in 2015, the accumulated assets of the millionaires in Asia Pacific will exceed the total of $15,800 billion recorded in 2014, as well as the assets of the millionaires in North America, which currently represent the richest people in the world, with a total wealth of $16,200 billion, transmits AFP.
The study indicates that the Asia Pacific region already has the largest number of very wealthy people, named in the High Net Worth Individuals financial jargon, HNWI, with 4.69 million such individuals in 2014, compared to 4.68 million in North America.
HNWI are people who can invest at least a million dollars, without taking into account the value of real estate and other assets.
"In the future, HNWI wealth is expected to grow more in Pacific Asia than in any other region of the world, most of the new assets coming from emerging economies in China, India, Indonesia and Thailand," is shown in the study carried out by Cappemini and RBC Wealth Management.
The report estimates that China and India represent almost 10% of HNWI's global wealth and are responsible for 17% of the global increase in new assets after 2006.
China, the world's second economy after the US, had in 2014 a number of 890,000 millionaires with a wealth of $4,500 billion, increasing by 17.5%, and 19.3%, compared to 2013.
In turn, India has the fastest rate of growth in the number of millionaires, 26.3%, up to 198,000 people, while their accumulated wealth grew by 28.2%, up to $785 billion.
"Dorel" mounted the reverse traffic light
In Suceava, the workers set up a light above the ground, so instead of being informed that they have to wait 4 seconds, the passers-by receive the message "h", which they cannot decipher.
It's not bad, but everybody else goes red, informs the truth.
Everyone passes the way he cuts his head.
Two boys were gonna be picked up by a car because they went red.
"The police at Routera should be here, helping, until the world gets used to it," said a woman for the quoted source.
The lighthouse was recently mounted in front of the Great Stone in the center of Suceva, but the passers-by does not seem willing to consider it, as much as the information received appears to be inconceivable.
After 6 comes 8, followed by an L, instead of 9-8-7 series.
If "Dorel" did his job properly and someone found himself responsible enough to give him the ok for the completion of the work, then he would never have gotten into this absurd situation.
The head of the Road Administration and Routing Service in Suceava Town Hall recognizes with canadare that it was the girl when the traffic lights started working, but he did not realize that something was wrong.
We used them, but we didn't realize it was a mistake.
"I was really the girl when they were put into operation," Stefan Vasincu said, promising that the problem will be fixed in the shortest time.
Thank God it can be fixed, because there are situations where "Dorel" has done irreparable damage.
For example, when he worked at the Giurgiu-Russian pipeline, "Dorel" missed the drilling mill that dug the tunnel under Dunare, it is unknown where, probably under the ground, buried, was not to be found anyway, as even the minister of the economy, Mihai Tutose.
Police put guns with water on immigrants
On the main border of Hungary with Serbia, Hungarian granites used water and tear gas cannons against immigrants on Wednesday.
Although Hungary closed the border with a barbed wire fence and introduced harsh measures against illegal immigrants, including the arrest, at the Serbian-Hungarian border continued to gather refugees, says The Guardian.
The water cannons were put into operation when the immigrants managed to patrol through the barbed wire fence through the crossing point at the border of Roszke.
The Hungarian police maintain that gun operation was a measure of crowd control, which throws out bottles of water.
There are no reports of possible injuries, but some people cry after the use of tear gas.
The Greek publication Enikos writes, at the same time, that two German companies refused to deliver Hungarian ginger sarma.
Tara has already raised the fence to the border with Serbia and Tuesday has announced her intention to raise one and the border with Romania, a highly criticized initiative in Bucharest.
German companies claim that barbed wire is very dangerous and provoke cuts that can be infected.
It is used to secure military prisons or facilities, but should not be used against people who seek shelter, support companies.
In parallel with the confrontations at the Hungarian border, Croatia has mobilized to put at the disposal of the immigrants buses to transport those present at the border of the country with Serbia.
The Croatian Ministry of Internal Affairs confirmed that buses were sent to the border to take immigrants to reception centres.
373 people entered Croatia from Serbia, of which 73 children, also showed the Ministry.
Tsipras, about the drama of Greece - why agrees with the third agreement with the EU
The stated purpose of former Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras was to save the country from even more austerity and to fundamentally change its relationship with the EU leadership in Brussels.
Finally, the Syriza leader made part of a third loan agreement for this country in Greece, which involves even more years of austerity and reform, according to Euronews, which conducts an interview with the country.
Now, however, Tsipras asks the Greeks to again entrust his mandate as prime minister in elections which he claims will strengthen his political position.
Our goal was to obtain an agreement, not an exit from the euro area or the dismemberment of the euro area.
"Now, for the first time, the possibility of restructuring debt for Greece remains open," former Prime Minister Elen said.
Now, we have an agreement that can be described as a strict one.
"But I knew from the beginning that any compromise would have been concluded in the form of an agreement," Tsipras added.
It is of the opinion that the funding part of the agreement is a great success for the Hellenic government, showing that all the financial needs of the country are covered by 2019.
"Alexis Tsipras further says that Greece "is definitely in need of reforms", specifying that it must begin with the reform of the state.
Tsipras announced his resignation on 27 August, thus opening the way for early elections, in September, after seven stormy months at the head of the Athens Executive, the period when a third rescue loan was approved for Greece.
He picked himself with his neck broken and one grade burns after he blew up in front of his electronic cigarette.
A 23-year-old man in Georgia suffered one degree burns, fractured throat and finger and a hole like a coin in the sky of his mouth, after an electronic cigarette that he smoked exploded in front of his face.
James Lauria was taking a short break smoking at work when the incident took place after he stayed in intensive care for a week, writes The Daily Mail.
Lauria, who was connected to a breathing device, suffered also handburns and corneas and a front tooth entered her gum.
I was at work and things were quiet and I went out for a second, just like I always do.
"On the other hand, it exploded and I was on my way to the hospital in an ambulance, that's the last thing I remember," Lauria told me.
Six weeks after the accident, Laurie still can't swallow solid food and follow a liquid diet as she recovers from her parents' homes.
The electronic cigarette that caused the injuries of the man is in custody of the authorities, which conducts an investigation of the incident.

Star Trek's actress in jail because she's naked in front of some kids
Actress Jennifer Lien, known from Star Trek, where she played for three seasons, intriguing Kes, was arrested for indecent exposure to children.
The incident that led her to prison, where she was from 3 September - bail being set at 2,500 dollars - took place in front of her home in Tennessee.
Vedeta started arguing with a neighbor, Carey Smith, because of one of her children crying, reports Mirror.
At one point, during the fight, the actress lifted her shirt, showing her bust, because then, before entering the house, she would take off her pants.
When the police came, Jennifer refused to get dressed.
Moreover, it threatened to kill the cops and was forcibly taken to the car.
It's not the first time that the 41-year-old actress has trouble with the police; in April, she was also arrested, then making herself guilty of the attack.
Jennifer entered Kes's skin in 1995, after he appeared in "American History X", a film in which he also played Edward Norton.
He quit acting in 2002, when his first child was born.
She is married to the writer and producer of Phil Hwang.
They're caught in sight with the Western machine gun.
Stop supporting terrorism!
Syrian President Bashar of Assad has given a rare interview to the Russian press, in which he speaks against refugees and accuses the West as supporting terrorists and as "visoring" immigrants.
"The ocean cries for them and the West sustains terrorism from the beginning of the crisis, when it said it is a peaceful revolt," Assad said in an interview with Russia Today.
The leader of Damascus claims that his Western counterparts say the situation in Syria is terrorism like the Islamic State, "but because of the Syrian state or the Syrian regime or the Syrian president."
As long as this propaganda follows, they will have more refugees.
So it's not about the fact that Europe didn't accept them or hugged them as refugees, it's about not treating the cause.
If you're worried about them, it doesn't support terrorists.
That's what we think about the crisis.
"This is the core of the entire refugee issue," the Syrian leader added.
Assad continued the charges against the Western States and what they show against refugees.
It's like the West now is crying for refugees with one eye and looking at the machine gun with the second eye, because those refugees actually left Syria because of terrorism, mainly because of terrorists and crimes and, secondly, because of the results of terrorism.
"When you have terrorism and destroy infrastructure, you won't have the basic living resources, so many people go because of terrorism and because they want to win their existence somewhere in this world," says Bashar al Assad.
"If we asked any Syrian today what he wants, the first thing he would say would be 'We want security and security for every person and every family'," the Syrian president stressed, adding as political forces, whether inside or outside the government, "should unite around what the Syrian people want."
The President of Syria is of the opinion that the dialogue in the country should continue "to reach a consensus", which cannot be implemented "unless we violate terrorism in Syria".
"I would like to take this opportunity to ask all the forces to join against terrorism, because this is how we, as Syrians, can achieve the political goals we want through dialogue and political action," Bashar al Assad said.
He also spoke of one of his country's allies, Russia's president Vladimir Putin, claiming that, in the context of the Ukrainian crisis, he was transformed from a friend of the West into his enemy.
Bashar al Assad compares the situation in Syria with that in Russia, accusing the West once again of falsifying reality in both cases.
Notice what happened in the Western press after the coup in Ukraine.
What happened?
President Putin was turned from a friend of the West into an enemy and was characterized as a tar.
It is portrayed as a dictator who suppressed the opposition in Russia and who came to power through non-democratic means, despite the fact that it was elected in democratic elections, and the West itself acknowledged that the elections were democratic.
Now, they're no longer democratic.
"This is Western propaganda," said the leader of Damascus.
Not last, it included Russia on the list of friendly countries - and regional partners - with which Syria is prepared to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, alongside Iran and Iraq, "because it faces the same type of terrorism".
On the other hand, Bashar of Assad criticized Turkey, another neighbouring country, as well as President Recep Erdogan and Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, who said that "I can't even make a move without first coordinating with the United States and other Western countries".
In addition, the President of Syria accuses "the international coalition", led by the United States, which fights against terrorism: "In fact, since this coalition began to operate, the Islamic State has begun to expand."
In other words, the battle has failed and has no impact on the ground.
At the same time, countries such as Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Western countries that provide a cover for terrorism, such as France, the United States or others, cannot fight terrorism.
You can't be against terrorism at the same time.
"But if these countries decide to change their policies and realize that terrorism is like a scorpion - if you put it in your pocket, it will sting you - then we have no object in cooperating with all these countries, considering that it is a real and not false coalition that fights against terrorism," the leader in Damascus said.
Autumn?
No way.

The map of the countries with the highest prices and how Romania is staying
The breakdown of the share of oil has resulted in significant losses in the last year for workers in the extract of the title, the shareholders of energy companies and the countries that depend heavily on this resource.
But there is also a positive effect: gasoline has been very cheap.
A map compiled by Bloomberg shows that, from October 2014 to July 2015, in almost all 76 countries considered, the price of fuel fell.
The biggest price reduction in the pump is seen in Venezuela.
In this country, the engine cost 97%, so you can feed 24 SUVs less than a dollar.
At the opposite pole is Saudi Arabia, where the price is kept fixed by the state.
The cost of the engine varies from country to country, depending on the conditions of refinement, changes in taxation, but also fluctuations in the currency rate.
For a more accurate comparison, Bloomberg turned the average price of each state into US dollars.
The situation in Romania
The Bloomberg data shows that, in the second quarter of the year, the average price of a gallon of gasoline (approx. 3.8 litres) was $5.49.
So we're ranked 27th in the country with the most expensive fuel.
But we don't have to worry about this position at the top.
The last quarter girl in 2014, gasoline also got cheap in the Romans.
Then the average price of a gallon was $6.14, which means a price reduction of 10.6%.
However, the surrounding countries are still better off.
In Bulgaria, a gallon of petrol costs $4.92, and in Hungary - $5.20.
The Germans trace the fate of immigrants in the middle of the night: What Merkel promised
German Chancellor Angela Merkel promised, Tuesday night, that the federal government will provide additional support to the 16 federal lands in receiving and distributing the tens of thousands of migrants entering the country through southern Europe.
After a close four-hour meeting with prime ministers from the 16 federal states, Merkel said that "the most important thing now is to create an orderly and transparent process to face the large number of refugees," notes the DPA agency.
She added that the federal government will create 40,000 seats for initial arrivals as well as distribution centers.
"These pivot points are needed," she pointed out.
The entire country must provide a massive impulse to face the crisis, Merkel added.
The Land Premiers called for more help than the 6 billion euros agreed by the federal government coalition more than a week ago.
Thuringia Prime Minister Bodo Ramelow of the Standa Party asked for a sum of "the least double, and for commitments, to be accelerated", in comments to a local newspaper.
In his turn, the Land Prime Minister Renania-Palatinate, Malu Dreyer, insisted that migrants be quickly integrated into German society.
"We need a national pact between all players, not only the federal government, states and municipalities, but also businesses, trade unions and civil society," she said.
Dreyer also called for bureaucracy in the manipulation of refugees and migrants to be accelerated.
She noted that Switzerland completed the trial in 48 hours and the Netherlands in 11 days, while Germany needed more than 5 months.
Land Prime Minister Bavaria Horst Seehofer expressed similar feelings.
Until now, Bavaria bears the most heavy burden, with the most migrants arriving after crossing the Austrian border.
Seehofer, a strong federal actor as head of the Crestin-Social Union (CSU), a key component of the federal coalition government, entered into public conflict with Merkel after the chancellor announced a virtual open door policy at the beginning of the month, recalls DPA.
Mircea Lucescu scandalizes after the humiliating violation of Real Madrid
Mircea Lucescu was a nerve cart at the end of the game with Real Madrid, which Sahtior Donetk lost with 0-4.
The Roman coach was totally disturbed by arbitration, saying that Sahtior lost because he was disadvantaged.
Before the game, I said one thing, that I wanted to be respected.
Unfortunately, in the major teams in Europe we are always disadvantaged by arbitration.
They're two totally different ways.
We were given a yellow card right away, while the top teams weren't.
Besides, the first penalty wasn't in any way!
The ball hit Darijo in the back, without touching his hand.
Such a level game should not be influenced by arbitration.
"I'm sorry arbitration ruined the game," Mircea Lucescu said at the press conference.
"Ma'am, but what smells so ugly here"?
They were pieces of cut-off husband
A murder of a common sadism terrified the inhabitants of Targu Frumos and Roman.
Yesterday morning, in the early hours of the day, the markets in Targu Beautifuls were able to see terrifying scenes near the main market entry.
Along with the three dumpsters, the criminals have "liked" in pieces what seemed to be a man's body.
He was cut off, but his head, internal organs, and genitals were missing.
Finally, it would prove that it was the body of a former officer, who had been cut off by his wife, professor of geography.
"Iași's day" has been talking about bad things even with the taxi driver who helped the killer, without knowing, to the carrying of the sacks with the dead body.
His stories make your hair chubby.
The one who alerted the police yesterday about the fact that a woman whose three bags were horrifying, after parts of the body had been found on the market, was a taxi driver from Targu Bemos.
As in American films, the man himself helped transport bags full of human pieces, which smelled hard, but not knowing, the killer being a customer for a race.
The taxi driver exclusively told the "Iași's Day", the shocking scenes he went through, helping without wanting a killer to hide evidence.
It carried with his hands the bags in which were the pieces of body of the teacher's husband of geography, which he had cut down.
She had come to Targu Beautiful to hide the evidence of the crime as far away from her home as Roman.
Maybe he's got lambs.
I didn't know how you knew.
Nea Mihai, as is known by her friends who practice taximetry in Targu Beautifuls, became a star overnight in the small city in which she lives.
He saw American films throughout his life, but he never thought he would ever be the one who would be the one who would lay the groundwork for the discovery of a sadistic crime, and he would see with his eyes pieces of bodies.
It tells us that, on Monday night towards Tuesday, it expected as usual the arrival of buses that regularly transit the town.
It is near the intersection of the roads to Roman and to the Paccani.
The taxi driver reports that the killer woman observed it in the rear-view mirror, next to the bags with body parts supported by the indicator showing nearby locations.
She came in the night with Massaro's race from 1.30.
The bus left it ten metres from the pedestrian crossing from the Paccani, exactly at the terminal where it displays the km.
The bags were summarized by the signboard with the indicator.
After the bus left, I hit the sidewalk ten meters, up to it.
I opened the trunk and, after I put a bag, I asked, "Madam, what does it smell so ugly here?"
I saw that she's an old woman, and I told myself to help her.
I thought he was taking meat to the market, to the disposal, maybe he had lambs, I didn't know how to know.
I've thought maybe he wanted to bite someone with that stinking meat.
She was trying to pick up a bag alone, and I rushed to help her.
I put my hand on the top of the bag, where it was tied.
"He specified me to take her to the main gate of the market, when I took her from the bus," he began to tell Nea Mihai.
I couldn't stay in the car anymore.
He added that the woman was not saying anything at all, and therefore neither was he curious to ask her anything.
Until the destination, I didn't talk anything, because I was nervous that he put my thief in the car.
And when he put the bags down from the car, I noticed that it smells even worse.
She took off the bags from the trunk.
When I got back in the car, I gave two meters back to get back, and I realized I can't stay in the car anymore.
I left the trunk open and moved the car back and forth, to disappear the smell.
On the bus I didn't notice if it was helped by someone to bring down the bags, because we had lights in the back and we didn't see right in the mirrors.
"There were two bags of plastic and one of rabies," the man added.
Seeing the strange behavior of the woman, she says that she began to maim his curiosity.
In my mind, I realized something was wrong.
After he took his bags off, I went to the hospital, to the City Hall, and when I came back, I looked especially at what the woman with the luggage is doing.
She had drawn the luggage after the fence in the meantime, where there are also the dumpsters inside the market.
Then I left again.
It was a little agitated because a bus arrived from Italy and a bus.
I saw how the woman went to their drivers to get into them, disappear, but probably the drivers didn't want to take it, because they had international races, and they don't take passengers on occasion.
The woman was very agitated, she walked over and over.
At some point, the woman entered Peco and, out of curiosity, I asked an employee outside what she did inside.
The employee answered that he had gone and washed his hands.
Then I asked him where the police patrol was, because I had seen her a while ago.
I searched them and found them coming to the market.
I showed them the woman and told them it was something suspicious.
"Then I went somewhere else, a race to Belize," added Nea Mihai.
He told us that the woman had become agitated after he left the luggage at the dumpsters.
To me, the suspicion went away from the fact that the luggage disappeared, and I was curious what it did to him.
When the cops went to her, they asked her what she was doing there and showed up to me, telling her that I warned her that she had a suspicious luggage.
Then the woman went to the dumpsters and showed them the luggage.
"I went back to the place where he hid the bags around 3 o'clock, when I gave statements to the police and prosecutors on the spot," the cab driver finished his story.
The prosecutors in the Netherlands, who investigate the case, say that the 64-year-old teacher, Ana Zaharia, was surprised by the cameras of a gas station in Rome at 0.55, climbing with the three bags on the bus.
She arrived at Targu Beautiful at 1.30.
According to investigators, she would have killed her husband, with whom she had been married for four years, with a knife, then cut him in the house.
The man was called Gheorghe Zaharia, and he was a reserve officer.
Sunday night, the woman put the body parts in two plastic bags, which she carried to the bus station, and hid them.
Last night, he transported another one, then decided which direction to go, and chose the bus Bucharest - Iași.
Last night, prosecutors still didn't know where she hid her husband's internal organs, as well as genitals.
However, the head was found wrapped in newspapers and bags, in a bar in the woman's apartment.
She was retired, like her husband.
Until last night, prosecutors didn't find out from the woman who was the reason he killed his husband with so much cold blood and sadism.
Most likely, the teacher will be psychologically experted, and the body will be examined by the forensic doctors, to officially determine the cause of death and any other relevant details.
The City Hall took the national roads from the city, after years had been taken over by the Government, in order to be able to be asphalted with money from the national budget in the 2004 election campaign.
The decision was adopted yesterday by the local Council (CL), and in order to be implemented a decision of the Government is required.
Some sources say that the transfer of the right of administration from the Regional Directorate of National Roads was a condition for the latter to give the opinion for the Ur Banystic Plan General (PUG).
The City Hall took over a network of 11 km of roads.
In any event, a legislative amendment which was adopted in July 2015 obliges the municipality to take the national roads that transit the municipality.
No opinion can be issued from the National Roads if the law is not respected, so it was necessary to approve this.
National roads have been in our administration since today.
"Of course, government decisions will also have to be issued as a result of this decision of the Local Council," interim mayor Mihai Chirica said.
The national roads that shut down the municipality are DN 24 and DN 28.
The 28th National Road beats the Iash on the arteries: the road Păcurari, rue Munteni (to be mafur), Moara de Fire, Strapunge Silvestru, rue Silvestru, bd. Nicolae Iorga, bd. Primaverii, Viae Chisinăului, the road Toustora until the exit from the municipality to Tomești - Albița.
The other national road, DN 24, includes the road Bucium, Bd. Socola (up to traffic light), Bucium street (up to Base 3), Chisina Street, Bd. Tudor Vladimirescu, Bd. C.A. Rosetti and exiting towards Cârlig-Sculeni.
Radu Gyr and Eliade
Following the description of some of Mircea Eliade's "file" political sympathies of young people who, however condensed, would have been presented exceeding the size of a daily article and should be broadcast in the series, deserves, I believe, evoked the friendship between Radu Gyr and Mircea Eliade, one of the most vehement charges used by the detractors of the great Romanian scholar.
A less humorous description would, I hope, be useful in the real debate that the recent law, called "antilegionary", should spark it in the Romanian intellectual environment.
Analysing the various versions that talked about the registration of Eliade in the Legion through the "Axe" and Radu Gyr, Florin Turcanu discusses the volume of Mircea Eliade.
The prisoner of history (București, 2003), another hypothesis, which interests us in the highest degree in understanding the resumption of epistle contacts between Radu Gyr and Eliade in 1968, after playing Ceaușescu "scena del balcono" in August that year.
Based on the documents signed by Radu Gyr under pressure, during the security investigation in 1941, documents kept today in the SRI archive (FD, File 573, f.15) as well as on a tracking note from 1938, Florin Turcanu states that "Eliade will not enter their group, but in the so-called "legionary family" called the Light, a group of intellectuals, especially writers, led by the poet Radu Gyr".
Since there is no verifiable data about the Light nest, those in exile considering the existence of this questionable "legionary family", what needs to be discussed is, after all, the context in which this information was recorded in the file.
Leaving on a surprising side the kindness of the SRI to make these secret files available to Mr. Turcanu, it is more than obvious that, at that time, the aim of the pursuit of security was "commandant" Radu Gyr, mentioning Eliade by making himself, as noted in March 21, 1938, in the context of Armand Călinescu, the Minister of Internal Affairs had received free hand to take all necessary measures so that King Carol could impose his royal dictatorship, suspending his parliamentary life and eliminating the main political force of legions that began to enjoy an unexpected popularity (the All Party for the country had gone out third in the 1937 elections).
Eliade's arrest was carried out as a result of this note, quoted by Turcanu: "Eliad Mircea, writer and journalist, enrolled in the Legion Movement in 1935 in the group of writers and poets under the leadership of Professor Radu Demetresco Gyr".
As far as I am concerned, I see this note as a thin bureaucratic cover for the 1938 repression and it is likely that such superficial notes were made on the recast for the vast majority of legionaries or active sympathizers in the public area who were to be arrested but who were to be bound by an important legionary leader.
Radu Gyr's holograph statement recalled above, given in custody, in February 1941, after the collapse of the legislative rebellion, only makes it retrospectively confirm the first, the banal method of bureaucratic coverage in any police, authoritarian regime.
It would have been interesting if Turcanu had provided more details about the contents of the cited file 573.
Was it Eliade's file or Radu Gyr's?
Because anyway it must be a file built on the basis of safety documents, but then processed by Security to be used either against or against each other.
It is here a misunderstanding, as in the case of the use of the term "member" of the Movement, which only one who knows the interior structure of this radical organization based on a religious foundation knows that it represents a pre-eminent stage, evidence, in which the person in question acts as an active sympathizer, who is in the three-year trial period before becoming "camera" with acts all right.
Also, all these forms of secondary organization such as clubs or intellectual scenes, chairs, discussion groups with peasants, youth organisations or students gravitated around a nest, were his "family", were not his own nest, as a form of political organization and action.
This kind of nuances completely escapes the undressed reader by making Eliade's "membership" status (which may be plausible) to be understood and used ad literam to designate political registration in the nest.
Of course, the invocation of such subtleties of interpretation cannot conceal the public activity of support of the Guard and clear sympathy for the Captain who animated Eliade during the period 1935-1940, whether in the siege of Nae Ionescu or not.
Public support for a cause in which you believe, however, does not necessarily mean, and the political regime itself said much more as, normally, intellectuals of this size retain a type of superiority in the face of activists as such and does not enter politics unless they are given direct high privileges.
As much as I could form an opinion about the type of thinking of Eliade from that time, when he was the "leader of the young generation", I find it hard to believe that he would have accepted the hierarchical rigors of a legionary nest.
And Radu Gyr didn't have Nae Ionescu's intellectual ascendant, though!
In order not to mention, except in the past, the fact that, in any legionary "file", what it receives is anti-Semitic public activity as well as violence, both worthy of stigmatized, but non-existent in the case of Eliade, up to new evidence.
With regard to Eliade-Gyr's correspondence from 1968 to 1969, Mircea Handoca, an enthusiastic defender of Eliade, tries to sanction the claims of Florin Turcanu (based on some archival documents, even if he deserved more dissected and contextualized) with a questionable argument.
Mircea Handoca notes in the New Glossaries on Mircea Eliade (București, 2006) that "not one line of correspondence between Mircea Eliade and Radu Gyr does not contain any allusion to this frame".
He had no way in 1968, when he came out somewhat alive from the communist occas, Radu Gyr could not have risked any allusion in a letter that was obviously intercepted by censorship.
What I think meant to highlight Mircea Handoca is that the tone of these letters sent by Radu Gyr was a respectful, admiration and affection without any doubt about Eliade's descent.
There really is not even the paleest suggestion that Radu Gyr would ever have been head of Eliade.
Intelligently, the poet obliged to write at the Glasul of Patrie, exposes himself from the head of the place the embarrassing condition by signaling to Eliade (who knew very well exactly what mission he had that publication that had constantly dealt with with denigration of the exile of the right), in signature, after "your old friend", what to expect and is visiblely easy and happy when he responds affectionately after nearly three decades of separation since the "viclean time" drew them away.
There is no doubt about the fact that, beyond the "mission" with which he had been charged (to convince Eliade that now, in the new Romania, he could come back at least quietly to see his mother and friends) and that he skillfully fulfills his dryness and short sentences, broken by paragraphs, to suggest their character as a foreign body, Radu Gyr shows only interest in literature.
No mention of esoteric allusions, suggested refined political complicities or any evoked years of youth in a register other than the cultural one.
It is hard to believe that Radu Gyr would have been superior on Eliade's legionary line, but until the consolidation of this version with less circumstantial evidence than that offered by Florin Turcanu, we have in this correspondents memoirs confessing a mutual appreciation of characters who have marked different, but stately, our culture and who, beyond the severe trials of life, find the tone of civilization and interbelic education.
Important human and cultural documents and, why not?, predators for the strength of friendship and mutual respect beyond the fate "under" of the authors.
In the early 1970s, Eliade finally gave up his refugee status by obtaining American citizenship and, under the pretext offered by the health problems and the disasters in the country, announced the RSR authorities, through the embassy (with which he had a broad correspondence used to obtain passports for his sister), that he could not give the course of the invitation to return to the country.
The following was predictable: it is again put to the index, it mounts in Israel "Toladot business", the books sent to the family and friends (Fragments d'une journal, Gallimard 1973) are stopped by censorship, never to see their mother again.
Among friends in the country only with Noica has a sporadic correspondence although surprisingly, as a personal Chicago archive attests, a lot of individuals or Romanian institutions are still able to send them messages.
It's clear why Radu Gyr never received permission to write it after 1969.
And after 1977, when the Ceauşescu regime tried Eliade's second conviction operation (by official invitations, the steps of Noica, translations etc.) Radu Gyr had already passed forever.
New coach, foreign player
Due to the shortage of indigenous volleyballists, Penicillina Iași tested in sports tournaments in Serbia, Montenegro, Bulgaria and Poland.
The exits take part in training tournaments under coach Dan Gavril's command
Retrograded in the first half of the year of Division A1 of female volleyball, Penicillina Iași kept her place in the first stage due to the withdrawal and then the disbandment of the Miroslava Science, fresh promoted in the first stage following a barrage tour held even in the outlying commune.
The news took a little unprepared leadership of the exit group, which woke up without the main coach (after the departure of Rareș Puni, reached second to Bacău Science) and many missing players, some retired such as Cristina Lungu and the free Diana Studienanu, or left, as Ana-Maria Berdila (the Blue Blue Flight champion) and the sisters Maria and Iuliana Faca.
Of course, until the scheduled 10 October championship was resumed, there was still time for the batch to be completed.
First a new coach was found in Dan Gavril's person, who came from the male team LPS Piatra Neamț and who has been working on Penicillin in the last few years, he is humbling to sign a contract with the group led by Vasile Left.
Then two players were brought from the Science Miroslava, Raluca Pichiu and Tatiana Diaconită, being tried and some foreign players from Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro and Poland, closer to transfer being the Serbian player Katarina Jovanovic (from Amiens, France) and Montenegrin Jelena Cvijovic (Zrenjanin).
At the beginning of the month, the Peniciline group led by Dan Gavril performed a canton at the Gura Humorului, after which he participated in a tour held in Lugoj and equipped with Banat Cup, where the exits achieved a victory (3-0 with Cluj University), but also suffered two failures, 0-3 with CSM Lugoj and SCMU Craiova.
Next week, from September 23-25, Penicillina will take part in another tour in Craiova.
For the new championship we're trying to make up a valuable team.
We have a skilled coach with experience, but the Romanian player fund is quite small and that is why we will also call on volleyballists abroad, especially after the decision has been made that teams can use an unlimited number of players from outside the country.
This decision will affect the young generation of sportsmen from clubs in Romania.
"We were hoping to reach the end of the competition year on 5-6 places, even if it would be very difficult," said left Vasile, President ACS Penicillina Iași.
Exciting meeting.
Twins reunited after almost 70 years
The 69-year-old twins George Skrzynecky and Lucian Poznanski were born at the end of World War II in Germany after their Polish mother had barely been released from a labor camp.
Since she was too sick to care for them, the twins were sent to Poland for adoption, the two brothers being separated not only from the one who gave them life but also from the other.
Ten years George and Lucian didn't know about each other's existence.
At the age of 17, George discovered the documents that showed that he was adopted and that he had a brother.
In the 1960s, he asked the Red Cross to help him find his brother, but they did not discover any trace that would lead him to Lucian.
Just in 2015, thanks to the program, Restoring Family Links" of the Red Cross, the twins met, and the moment was more than exciting.
BBC reporters surprised this episode.
Ten children from Iași brought home from Stuttgart four medals to sports dance
Two gold medals, one silver medal and one bronze were won by the children out at the German Open Championship in Stuttgart, an international sports dance competition organized by the German Federation of Sports Dance and the World Federation of Sports Dance.
From Iași participated five couples training at the Dance Energy Club and dancing with 9,000 athletes from 20 countries.
The 10 children from abroad participated in five different categories (youths 1, junior 2, youth and amateurs).
Those who returned home with the medals were the pairs: Razvan Andrei Zaharia and Ana Maria Tarzianu (two gold medals and one silver), Vlad Constantin Donosa and Otilia Stefana Gologan (bronz medal).
And three other couples managed to occupy front seats: Bogdan Stelian Sunday and Sara Maria Dolniceanu, Vlad Ene and Antonia Ioana Iosub Cujba and not lastly Andrea Emilia and Raluca Elena Ioniţa.
As a coach, I really wanted to reaffirm the results achieved in March of this year, this reconfirmation being necessary both for us and for sportsmen in terms of their future development.
The fact that we managed to hear Romania's anthem twice this year at German Open and to return home with four medals, we are delighted and confident that we can raise both the club and its athletes to the highest level.
"All these could only be achieved with a few important elements: involvement, respect, trust and a lot of work," said Andreea Ramona Manolache, the coach of children at the Dance Energy Club.
Romania was represented this year by 34 clubs in the country, obtaining a total of 9 medals, thus qualifying our country for 4 out of the 20 participating countries.
Of the nine medals, four came to Iasi.
6 ways to get rid of stress in a minute
Too few of us allow ourselves to run a weekend to the mountain to get rid of stress.
Some keep our time, others - the finances, and others both.
But there are solutions to anyone who wants to get rid of a little bit of stress.
These do not involve high costs and special time allocated, according to lyla.ro.
Day care is inevitable, but it depends on us how we face them and what attitude we take toward them.
Instead of grinding you inside and feeling like an implosion takes place in your mind, try the following relaxation tactics that don't steal more than a minute.
Deep Breathe
Breathing exercises are not intended solely for soloists or yoga practitioners.
They work for any man in part, and adjusting breathing in a tense moment helps release endorphins in the body, process leading to a state of relaxation, informs Livestrong.
Be a child
We know we've passed the age of childhood and we're no longer allowed to join each other when we want to.
But that doesn't mean we can't go to a corner of the office building or anywhere we know we're alone (even behind the building) and not scream how much we keep our lungs.
You can get rid of nerves and negative energy accumulated over a day with a few wild whistles.
Imagine a nice place
We know the recommendation sounds worth a replica of during a psychotherapy session, but psychologists don't really use it often.
Imagining a beautiful place, which inspires calm and detachment of daily braking, can lead to nerve attenuation.
It is really self-sustainment, a process that can even change lives, both for good and for bad.
Everything depends on what we're self-susung.
The best thing is to think about an idyllic place that warms our soul.
Listen to music
Put your castles in your ears and listen to relaxation music.
Attention, it's not about favorite music, because if it's about heavy metal you might get weights in relaxing.
Listen even to relaxation songs, which are lined and do not contain lyrics, to regain balance when your fitil has been lit.
Decojiti or orange
Does it sound weird to tell you to peel an orange to your nerves?
Well, it's not!
Because it is not about the fruit itself, because it does not contain miraculous substances or Xanax to disconnect us completely (occasionally, too total).
It's about aromatherapy!
The smell of orange shell, during the peeling, stimulates the brain to produce endorphins, good condition hormone.
Eat an animal
Those who have animals nearby, whether it's about the one at home, or the one who's sitting next to the job, take a few seconds to handle it.
According to the U.S. National Center for Infectious Diseases, animal mania can reduce blood pressure.
time and rock with violin and guitar
Two musicians in love with some rival instruments, but collaborators in this acoustic project, sing Enescu, Vivaldi, Bach, Piazzola, Brahms, Mancini, Brubeck, Jobim, Django, Zeppelin, Purple, Queen, Floyd, but also famous pieces of Romanian folklore combining guitar violin.
The acoustic project belongs to the musicians Cristian Horia and Emilian Florentin Gheorghe and is titled WHEN Violin Meets Guitar, writes hotnews.ro.
Florentine: "We found each other, and since then it has made us very happy to sing together, with a virtually unlimited repertoire."
We thought this was the moment a violin met with a guitar.
Christi: "From the first meeting we realized that what we were singing is very well heard and that, from the point of view of the human component, things work."
Each of us learned from the other's repertoire and, what's very important, is that the sounds of the two instruments match.
Florentine: "I know there's a breakdown between people of classical music and the rest."
I think a lot of people can listen to classical music.
And secondly, we were stealing a Queen, a Deep Purple, our old rocks and, of course, jazz.
We want to find the bridge between genres, we want to offer a kind of music that could make those who only listen to classical music listen and rock, and those who listen only rock to get to like and classical music.
And we had the surprise of being told at the end of a concert that they never imagined they would listen to something like that and they would like it.
Cristi: "When we find young people - and we find more and more - that I know who Pink Floyd was, it seems amazing to us."
Iași students were more trafficked than at school on the first day after vacation
Hundreds of exits were "captive" yesterday morning in hell traffic in several areas.
The City Hall announced that today the Mangeron boulevard (Bahlui left side), between Tudor Vladimirescu and Podu Roș, is closing.
The chiefs of the City Hall did not respect their promises of carrying out work to smooth traffic with the start of the school year.
One of the assurances that the municipality has given, at least twice in the last few weeks, has seen in the re-establishment of the tour of the International War zone.
Although only a few provisional elements had to be assembled, and the final deadline for the work was the end of last week, yesterday the rotation was not realized.
The drivers' nerves were spread to the maximum on Nicolae Iorga and Cantemir, given that another promise of the City Hall was broken: the move of the customs activity of Nicolae Iorga to Technopolis "late until the end of August", in the context of which this transfer has been discussed since 2012.
Currently, interim mayor Mihai Chirica says that the problem at the International Station is more complicated.
The rotation will be done at the right time, we need to take account of the movement of trams in the area, we need an opinion and from the National Roads.
"It's not like in Zimbru, where it's time for the tram to stay on tour, but we'll sort it out somehow," said Chirica.
One of the solutions, according to it, would be to stop the tram with a traffic light before turning.
Problems in circulation were also at the intersection of Podu Roș.
The line of cars on St. Lazarus Street extended to the SRI headquarters.
"I waited for good minutes to get out in the Red Bridge," said one exiter.
By Podu Roș in September they had to circulate a streetcar to CUG, if the rehabilitation project "Development and rehabilitation of the southern functional artery" was completed within the initial execution period (31 July 2015).
There are two projects that complement the initial one.
"I drew European funds for new works, for example overexploitation, on the initial variant Nicolina was narrow," Chirica commented.
The latest deadline for reintroduction of trams is October.
During yesterday's day, exits reported traffic problems especially in areas such as Păcurari, Centro (Târgu Cucu, Independence, Armenian Street) or the intersection of Base 3.
Admires might come back as chief at the CJ.
In the days of tomorrow you'll know for sure.
The judges of the Tribunal will decide tomorrow whether the suspended President of the Judicial Council will maintain judicial control and prohibitions.
The judges of the Iași Tribunal settled a new deadline yesterday in the "Album", in which the defendant is also the suspended president of the Iași County Council.
At the end of yesterday's sitting, the magistrates decided to take action during tomorrow's day on the measure of judicial control currently imposed against the Crown.
The latter wishes to house or revoke this measure, which has kept it away from the head chair of the JC for several months.
In the case of a favourable solution, and if it is maintained also by the superior court, Christian the Crown will be able to resume its function as President of the JC.
The Admire was brought to trial by the National Directorate of Anticoruption (DNA), being accused of favouring the maker and false intellectual after, I say the choirs, tried to mask an audit control after which a series of irregularities had been discovered regarding the receipt of a public contract signed between CJ and Laser Co.
It would have tried to hide the fact that the institution that led it would not have received more materials to promote Iași county, although scripturally these figurative materials as received by the JC.
In addition, three CJ directors and the manager of the Laser Co company have also been referred to the court.
Another 3,500 exits are expected to vote by 25 September
The City Hall is prepared to distribute further questions, if the 12,000 will be exhausted.
The exits have only ten days to express their opinion on the replantation of the fabrics on the pedestrian Stefan the Great.
According to municipal officials, about 8,500 of the 12,000 questionnaires distributed at neighborhood centres and three additional points in the city (Copou Park, Alexander the Good Plan and City Hall) have been completed so far.
A record number of exits appeared on Sunday in front of the City Hall.
According to the representatives of the civic group "Iashu loves you", 530 exits voted in 140 minutes, and almost four votes cast every minute.
On the other hand, over the whole of the month, some 440 exits came in the same place.
The group's volunteers say that many exits advocate signalisation and the population laughs at the inefficient public consultation.
Therefore, they appealed yesterday to Internet users to print an information poster made available to the group and to stick it in the block stairwells.
Volunteers also showed that at the additional point in Copou Park the last forms were completed by Sunday exits.
We'll offer forms from the neighborhood centers, where they're not very complete.
"Possible additions will be made when all 12,000 forms will be completed," said the municipal spokesman Sebastian Buraga yesterday.
"Scrulling the knots" will end on September 25, and if the majority vote of the exits is in favour of tree replanting then the City Hall will plant your silver in this fall.
The outings can express their views at the neighborhood centres of Dacia, Beauty, Tatarasi, Nicolina and Pasturari, as well as at the additional points mentioned above.
The chiefs of the City Hall decided to cut the wires of Stephen the Great in early 2013, which attracted a fine of 60,000 lei of the municipality.
The decision was adopted unilaterally, without consultation of the population, and led to the spontaneous appearance of the civic group "Iash loves you", an online community of about 13,500 people.
In the virtual environment, a petition initiated by the civic group for the replantation of fabrics was signed by more than 9,100 supporters until last night.
RECORD of students registered at USAMV Iași!
There's 920 in year I.
The university has in this year 920 students in the year I.
Representatives of the University of Agricultural Science and Veterinary Medicine "Ion Ionescu de la Brad" specified that this year were the most eligible candidates ever, from the history of the institution of higher education, since the establishment.
We are very pleased with the results this year from admission.
We have the largest number of candidates admitted in the history of the university, almost 920 students in the year I. I never exceeded that number.
"We have also had candidates with larger environments, we have taken up the posts from budget to license and master," said Prof. Ioan Tenu, headmaster responsible for didactic activity.
It further indicated that the university also registered a considerable number of tax students, occupying 20% of those places, a significantly higher figure than in other years.
Although the results were also published in the Romanian study lines, the admission to the English language study programme of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, which led to the competition of 50 places, where the fee is 5,000 euros, and now is expected from the ministry to confirm the necessary student files and study visas.
A total of 120 files were filed at the autumn session on the 14 budgeted places and 209 were presented to the "tax" competition at the license studies.
Most files were filed at the Faculty of Agriculture, number 75, at Horticulture were 23, and at Zooethnie, 22.
At the Master's meeting, 18 files were filed, on the 150 duty stations proposed by USAMV, seven of them at Agriculture, five at Horticulture and six at Zooethnie.
Drivers are afraid to get in with the wheels of the cars in the cracks on the Tudor Vladimirescu bridge
The bridge across Bahlui on Tudor Vladimirescu boulevard remained as crooked as when "Iași's Day" wrote about the problems it presented 10 days ago.
Our daily reporters then pointed out that on the axis delimiting the two ways of walking the asphalt was left, defending deep holes, some even 20 centimeters, through which concrete plates are seen representing the primary infrastructure of the bridge.
The asphalt also began to crack on both sides of the axis, prescribing signs that the depths will be accentuated.
At that time, interim mayor Mihai Chirica said that the bridge had no structural problems, being recently made a technical expertise, with a view to launching a project to rehabilitate the bridge and tram track worth EUR 5 million.
The Mayor of Chirica specifies that the area affected by fissures and pits will be signalized and asphalt restoration works will be carried out quickly.
The only steps taken so far, however, have been the setting up of pops and a signaling strip, without even making a single lead.
During this period, we focused more on opening up the school and the necessary work for this purpose.
"There is a timely expertise on the bridge that we are waiting for in about a week with the details necessary for the intervention, I appreciate that in no less than two weeks we can move on to remedy the situation," the interim mayor said.
At the beginning of the school year
Yesterday, my eldest son, Stefan, started school.
The preparatory class, how he tries to improve the situation.
I don't know if to enjoy or to let myself be overwhelmed by melancholy; bow, passive, to the second variant.
First, because I have the feeling that it's only been three weeks, not three years since I took him for the first time, with emotions, to the nursery.
Although it breathes lightly, no normal parent is happy to raise their children.
Second, because I remember perfectly the same day of my childhood; then began a story that, the top, didn't end even today.
I wasn't exactly what's usually called a conscious student.
On the contrary, I'd say.
But the school always liked me.
So much so that I chose to continue to frequent her, even as a teacher.
When I decided this was what I wanted to do all my life, I knew it wasn't an easy job.
And none with any stake.
That's because, like each of us, I've given up all sorts of teachers: better or worse, nicer or unbearable, smarter or right-handed.
Unfortunately, there are people with other calls in this breach.
I think they're toxic, because they damage enthusiasm and even the mind of a young man willing to form.
I was lucky to give, as long as I was a student or a student, over a few, few, exceptional ones.
These meetings can be decisive if they take place at the right time.
Who believes that the role of the professor is the trivial transmission of information is bitterly wrong.
This can be done by anyone; to be informed, the student can be very well informed by himself, that we only live in the time of transparency.
A good teacher, however, shapes the minds of the students.
It shapes them, it favors their thinking.
Staying at the cathedral is not a privilege, as I think it is enough, but a great responsibility.
Young people are very rude, demanding, unforgivable and always willing to look for hibels from their faces.
That's how they dictate age, temperament.
As a teenager, we all thought we knew everything, that we had certain things to do about anything.
When we grow up, we come to understand that we have only doubts.
That's why a teacher's role is to get the teenager out of the category of self-sufficiency and make him think.
I mean, they learn to doubt, ask questions.
To discover on their own the answers, both them and the provisionals.
Get involved in everything he does.
Lead him discreetly to profitable models.
It's very difficult, especially since the student often thinks the teacher is his enemy.
One that barely waits to catch him on the wrong foot to sanction him.
Now, that makes him, the purest misunderstanding, the rebel, due to living his age's calls, to look at the cathedral with suspicion.
That he just has no way to accept his natural attempt to order him.
Teenagers do not get up to date, they do not accept restrictions.
Or, if they seem to do it, they get revenge somehow.
And unfortunately, when there is a rigid person in the cathedral, who imposes himself by hardness and does not communicate, the students get revenge on the object taught.
There are thousands of such teenagers who miss meetings with great writers, for example, because of the lack of tact of the Romanian teacher.
There are thousands of such students who feel that history is a misconception of data, that mathematics is all that can be more tiring for their uncoupled mind.
I always urge my students: if you give a teacher you don't swallow, who doesn't know how to communicate from man to man with you, don't let him get you away from the literature to which you should go.
How did it happen that I became myself?
I had a very good teacher in the VI-VIII classes.
He opened my mind to some texts that have spoken to the puberty since then on his understanding.
I've met a university professor in high school who opened the door to his library.
I was looking at him like a man from another world: he had walls of the house covered with shelves full of books.
I was lost in his library and I was dreaming of having the same one.
Now I may have it, but if I hadn't taken my fate out of my way, I might have decided to become a footballer.
Or engineer or lawyer or who else knows what.
I don't think such meetings are random.
I don't believe in hazard.
It's essential that you take over the man who takes your hand and points you patiently to your own vocation.
And this is, most of the time, the teacher.
Now, my experience helps me just talk about what it means to teach literature.
It's just that the literature can't be delivered.
There is no literature teacher, as there is mathematics teacher.
How can you fix the ineffable concept?
You can, at best, approach him, without pretending that you transmit petrified truths.
The professor can most of the reading guide, that's something else.
But most of all, it can have some miraculous encounters, between a reader and some books.
There are meetings that can change the life of the bank.
There are meetings that can open his mind, that can raise someone's eye balances.
Therefore, the literature teacher must, first of all, be able to make his students understand (feel) that there is no divorce between literature and life.
On the contrary!
A great seamstress, Al. Paleologu, said one thing only apparently paradoxical: "How much literature, so much life, not vice versa!" and he was right.
That's why a good lady prepares you for life, doesn't make you a specialist in an open field anyway.
Fortunately, we always have to learn something.
And we, the teachers; or especially us, the teachers.
Most of the time, it only repeats from inertia a great truth: not only teachers have to learn from their masters, but also vice versa.
Ideally, the teacher should be a teacher, and the student a apprentice.
Which, like any valuable young man, leaves his master when he discovers his own way.
A few find him, he's right.
But the master was the one who lit the spark.
I don't think there's any greater happiness for a pure blood teacher than that of enduring as many such separations.

If the FIFA investigation extends
Justice in the US and Switzerland will lead to new arrests
The US and Swiss authorities have announced that criminal prosecutions will begin in the case of new individuals and organisations, in the FIFA corruption investigation, inform the international press.
American Justice Minister Loretta Lynch announced on Monday at a press conference held in Zurich that the investigation area of global football corruption was expanded.
"On the basis of our cooperation and on the basis of new evidence, we will undertake additional criminal prosecutions for new individuals and new organizations," Lynch said.
In May, several senior FIFA officials were arrested in Switzerland in this case of corruption.
Many of them have already been extradited into the United States.
"We have hope that other people prosecuted will reach the US," Lynch added.
Swiss Attorney General Michael Lauber, also present at the press conference, said that his institution had seized several goods, including dwellings and land in the Alps, as well as financial assets, in the collaborative investigation with the US.
"We didn't even get to the end of the first rendezvous," Lauber said.
So far, a very large amount of information has been confiscated, 11 terabytes.
At the same time, 121 bank accounts are being investigated.
In the interest of investigators also entered into a contract for the surrender of media rights at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa and 2014 - Brazil.
FIFA faces a major corruption scandal after the US justice has charged 14 people, including two FIFA vice-presidents and seven forum officials.
Detained persons are researched for taking bribes and receiving other benefits, from the beginning of the 1990s and up to now, totaling over $150 million.
Following this scandal, Swiss Joseph Blatter announced at the beginning of July that he was resigning from the position of president of FIFA after he was re-elected for the fifth time.
Beating like a movie at the theater
In the Supekombat gala of Milan, the exit of Catalin Moroșanu will fight the "beast" James Wilson
A series of Romanian fighters, including the "scorpion" Catalin Moroșanu will participate on 2 October at the Superkombat gala from Linear 4 Ciak Theatre in Milan, the last before the end of November, is shown in a media release MEDIAFAX.
We were impressed by the atmosphere last year, and as promised, we'll be back this fall with a new five-star gala.
While I've chosen an unprecedented venue, a theater, we promise to fight like in movies.
We'll have eight Romanian fighters on the schedule of the event.
In addition to the games with the already consecrated stars, we will have another gala in the opening, which will include the best fighters of the new generation, including the Romanians Cristi Spetcu, Cristian Stancu and Amansio Paraschiv.
"The full programme will soon be announced," Eduard Irimia said.
Catalin Moroșanu will fight in the gallery Superkombat World Grand Prix Final Elimination with American James Wilson, known after he participated in the last pyramid in the heavy category organized in Japan and numerous awards from bodybuilding contests.
I can't wait to fight in Italy.
I've seen Wilson, he's really a beast, but I'm demolishing him!
I'm still upset that last year I couldn't fight in the final, so now I'm gonna get revenge on him.
"From beast it turns into a cat," said Moroșanu.
Unconquered in 2015, the brothers Andrei and Bogdan Stoica will have in Italy the last confrontations before fighting for world titles on 7 November in the final sea.
Last year, they both went through KO in Italy, and now I promise they'll repeat the script.
I'm happy to go back to Italy, the atmosphere last year was incredible.
"I can't wait to meet the fans there and promise them a new show of unforgettable," world champion Andrei Stoica said.
In Milan he will fight Raul Catinaș with an opponent to be established.
A little girl invited the Queen of England to her day, but she also argued in her letter
A girl from Britain sent Queen Elizabeth an invitation to attend her birthday.
At the same time, the six-year-old girl congratulated the Queen for her longest reign, but did not forget to mention that she was not allowed access to the Buckingham Palace when she went to visit her family.
The letter did not go without echo, but the girl received an answer from the representatives of the Royal House.
The Queen thanked her for the invitation, but she also apologized for not being able to be present on September 27, but even hated her having fun with family and friends.
Cornelius Vadim Tudor and Adrian Paunescu were invited together to a talkshow shortly before poet Adrian Paunescu died.
Both writers died heartily.
The fate of Adrian Păunescu and Vadim Tudor is similar.
Both were writers and politicians and both died at close ages, of heart.
Adrian Păuneescu, 67 years old, Vadim Tudor, 65 years old.
Corneliu Vadim Tudor and Adrian Păuneescu were invited together in 2010, shortly before Adrian Pauneescu died on a TV reality show.
Full of verva, Vadim Tudor ironized Gheorghe Flutur and criticized Elena Udrea, the minister of tourism since then, for the situation of Romanian tourism.
At one point, Vadim Tudor told Adrian Paunescu, with the smile on his jokes, "I am jealous of your posthumous glory, Adrian."
Pounescu, smiling too, then said, "It's not too laudable what you said to me now."
Adrian Pauneescu died on November 5, 2010, at the age of 67.
Corneliu Vadim Tudor died today, September 14, 2015, at age 65.
Two Unknown People after an ACCIDENT in Dumbrava
An accident happened Monday night around 7:00 in Dumbrava County Iași.
A biker was taken up by a Volkswagen car park.
The cyclist was not observed by the driver.
Fortunately, they're both stable.
After the impact, the windshield and the mirror of the car were broken.
Two injured persons are unconscious at the time of the transmission of this news.
A SMURD crew is on their way to provide medical assistance and transport them to the hospital.
The cops are on site.
Syrian artist turned "Super Mario" into a refugee
A Syrian artist created a version with refugees of the popular "Super Mario" game, which evokes the plight of his countrymen on their way to Europe.
Instead of presenting the adventures of Italian installer Mario in the Kingdom of Ciupers, the modified video game has in the center of "Mario Refugee".
The character is trying to get past human traffickers and border police on his way to a European Union refugee centre.
The artist established in Istanbul uses the pseudonym Samir al-Moufti for security reasons and said he made the video game with Mario refugee after his friends ventured on a dangerous journey to Europe to escape the horrors of war.
At the Craiova detention center, the youngest student is 15 years old and is in class I.
Justice Minister Robert Cazanciuc said, at the opening of the school year at the Craiova Detention Center, that the youngest student is 15 years old and is in class I, and the oldest one is 25 years old and is in grade XI, showing that they could have another life if they went to school.
I chose to participate in the opening of the school year in a centre belonging to the National Penitentiary Administration to try to draw attention, and in this way, to less known realities.
The youngest student, aged 15, is enrolled in Class I, and the oldest is 25 and enrolled in Class XI.
"There are complicated topics that society is concerned to discuss right now, we are all overwhelmed by its own concerns and problems, but we must not overlook the lesson that these more than 100 young people from the Craiova Detention Centre offer," Minister Robert Cazanciuc said on Monday at the opening of the school year.
The Minister of Justice drew attention to the fact that the lack of education, motivated in many cases by the lack of material possibilities, may lead to tragedies, stating that young people in this centre would have had another chance in life if they could have taken a natural school course of any child, if they had the opportunity to learn not only to write, read, but also to receive a set of moral values, to know what it means to respect the law and what its consequences may be.
"The role of the penitentiary system is not to isolate permanently from society people who have broken the law, to shut them behind high walls, but to try to re-edit them and prepare them, so that when they return in the middle of the community they have more opportunities for reintegration," added Cazanciuc.
The Minister indicated that it is necessary to invest in schools, hospitals, roads, but investments must also be made in the prison system, because in many cases conditions of detention are limited to human beings and because, in the absence of money and staff, it will be difficult to talk about the reintegration of convicted persons.
We work very well with the Ministry of Education and thanks to this partnership, every year, in the prison system, are more than 2000 graduates of school education courses.
Obviously, we won't be able to change over the night what hasn't been done 25 years, but they're important steps we're making.
"In all these steps we need and support society, and this support can only come if we demonstrate that we are doing our duty, that through your work these young people have a chance and do not pose a danger to society," Cazanciuc said.
The Minister of Justice has succeeded both students and educators, showing that success comes only through the combined effort of all.
"And because today is the Feast of the Highness of the Holy Cross, I would launch all students and teachers the invitation to visit the mausoleums of Soveja, Marăști and not only to understand what it means to fight young people for ideals," said Robert Cazanciuc.
A Russian came to the vote with the bear
Doctoral schools caught with two plagiarisms to be disbanded!
The request of prestigious universities in Iași and the country
Over 200 researchers, academic frameworks, personalities and students from the country have signed a petition launched by the Academic Society of Romania requesting the Ministry of Education and Scientific Research to evaluate, sanction and even disband doctoral schools in Romania "which allow and promote academic taxation".
The authors of the petition launched on 10 September include teachers and teachers from Iasi.
Among the signatory university students of the request in the school environment is, for example, Professor Liviu Antonesia.
At the national level, the petition has names from former ministers of Education, such as Mircea Miclea, to culture people who are also academic academics, such as Andrei Pleșu, Aurora Liceanu or Alina Mungiu-Pippidi.
"Although the Law of Education provides for the evaluation of doctoral schools, this has not so far been achieved, thus determining the lack of concrete sanctions for doctoral schools that flagrantly violate the ethical rules of scientific research and do not produce relevant and internationally recognized performance," the petition stated.
That petition specifically calls for compliance with the National Education Act, the evaluation of doctoral schools, the suspension of the right of operation for any doctoral school in which more than two plagiarisms have been found, until the assessment and remedy of the situation.
The last requirement is to suspend the right of operation for any doctoral school in which there are no minimum number of doctoral leaders provided for by law to meet the criteria imposed by the National Scientific Research Council in 2011 for eligibility for IDEI grants.
Do you respect less a general without doctorate, or a politician, or an intelligence officer in the Middle East?
"Why do there not exist in Europe other academies that give doctorates organized by secret services, and the senior military who give their doctorate do it to autonomous academic institutions, where quality is verified by the academic environment?" said Alina Mungiu-Pippidi, President of the Romanian Academic Society, the petitioner, who originated from Iasi.
This can be supplemented by all the interested parties on the Company's website, and the final signatures will be submitted by the organisation to the Ministry of Education and Scientific Research.
We're not looking for three people with money, but 10,000 who want to get involved.
The party "For Iași", founded by young IT managers without political affiliation, was launched earlier in Copou Park.
The president of the "For Iași" Initiative Group gave an interview "Iași Day"
The Iash will have a dedicated party exclusively to the development of the city.
A group of political non-affiliated entrepreneurs and managers has launched at the end of last week the Iasi Party which will propose candidates to the 2016 local elections.
At present, the party's core is composed of IT specialists, but the formation's initiators say that all people who want to be involved in modernising the city are welcome in the organization.
The launch took place on Saturday in Copou Park, and more than 200 sympathizers participated in the event, almost all being young.
The special guest of the action was Nicusșor Dan, President of the Bucharest Saved Association.
He was surprised by the 2012 local elections when he managed, from the position of independent, to gather 10% of the votes of the joys for the function of mayor of the Capital.
"The people I saw at "For Iași" think they're very good at accessing the Iaş public administration."
I believe in this initiative, I think he has chances, I think he may have more chances in a smaller community than in Bucharest.
"I will always be with "For Iași," Nicusor Dan said.
ZDI: Why didn't you leave Iasi to work in an IT company abroad?
Andrei Postolache: The reasons are rather sentimental and emotional.
I've been away on many short business trips, I've lived in Cluj for a year.
I came back every time, because I felt like this is my house.
ZDI: Why have you now decided to set up a political party?
Andrei Postolache: Now that we have reached a certain maturity, we are a group of people who have been meeting us for some time.
We met in professional settings, we started discussing how we could get involved.
At first, we got more shy, into smaller things, with projects at NGOs, various building or charitable actions, and somehow things evolved naturally and organically and now it happened to be the time when we reached the decision that we had to involve ourselves more than that.
ZDI: Name three concrete projects to make local public administration more efficient!
Andrei Postolache: The first project consists of a minimal computerization of the city's activities so that different departments, institutions and kings can work together as well.
But more importantly, it is possible to publish transparent data on the activities carried out in detail: budgets, reports, projects etc. We are talking about informational organization.
The second would be transparency because this leads to efficiency.
If you have a project in a particular neighborhood, it is important to consult the public of the people affected.
If we talk about efficiency, we must not forget the common transport, we have the worst buses in the country.
New means of transport must be bought.
ZDI: Today, the image of a city is extremely important.
How would you promote the Iash?
Andrei Postolache: You get on the plane and look for investors in this world.
There are conferences, industry events where you can "sell" the city.
You have to want to do this and you know how to do it.
And here we have an advantage: we come from business and we brought customers to Iasi.
ZDI: What is the brand of Iash?
Andrei Postolache: My opinion is that we must be a city of technology, in one way or another.
We already have the IT industry and we must expand it, go to medicine, enter the robotics zone, into the 3D printing area, continue in this spirit and unite such elements.
I think the brand should be in the science area, I mean here the modern brand of the city.
Of course, Iash already has a historic brand that must not be changed, namely the cultural city.
I see the two elements in the balance: culture and technology.
ZDI: How will you compensate for lack of experience in public administration, as well as the lack of traditional party structures with which elections are still being won in Romania?
Andrei Postolache: The administration is a form of management, which means organization, planning, communication, working with people and running projects.
We have experience in management.
We don't want traditional structures, we don't care.
We want to involve people, we'll talk to everyone, we won't just stay on Facebook, we're not an online party.
We don't want to have "volunteers" brought with the bus.
That means we rely on people who really want to get involved and help, and we think there are enough people like that.
ZDI: Should the Mayor of Iash be more concerned with promoting the image of the city nationally and internationally, or is it necessary that the area of concerns be permanently of the edilitar nature?
Andrei Postolache: One without one does not work.
First you have to solve today's problems, the emergencies.
Or, if you don't make your city known, if you don't attract money in the city, at some point you're running out of money and you can't, for example, make streets.
We both need to be done at the same time and we need people with skills next to you.
The mayor doesn't have to do everything.
We have to give up the mayor-father's model, which comes and beats the fist in the mass and solves everything.
Oh, no.
We're a team.
The mayor is the coordinator of an orchestra.
ZDI: Will you try to attract business people in the IT area party who can support the party financially?
Andrei Postolache: We are looking for people who want to do something good, to have an unrelenting reputation, to be clear about integrity and to be honorable.
From this point of view, we have no other filters.
We're not looking for three people with money, we're looking for 10,000 people, or why not, 300,000 people who want to get involved and do something for the city.
Interview by Alex ANDREI
Andrei Postolache has been working in the IT industry for almost 15 years.
In July 2015, he set up the Introspecials company, after seven years he was the director of the international issue Endava (2008 - 2015), where he coordinated a team of 300 people.
Four more years (2003 - 2007) spent at Synygy.
The company that set up it with another IT specialist provides management consultancy services.
The Rabla Tractor Programme proved to be a failure
The Director General of SC Irum SA Reghin, Mircea Oltean, said that the programme to stimulate the renewal of the national tractor park and agricultural machinery, initiated in 2011, called Rabla for tractors, was a failure because of bureaucracy.
Related to the Rabla Programme, there have been some trials in recent years, but it has proved to be a failure, because the documentation was very laborious and complicated for a common farmer, and the approvals were too long and then the world gave up.
Through that program he managed to sell somewhere to 10 pieces.
"The need for tractors for Romanian agriculture would be 300,000 pieces," Mircea Oltean said.
According to him, IRUM Reghin is the only company that produces a few hundred tractors annually, being the largest in Romania, and that the great competition is exercised by companies abroad, who know the needs of the Romanian market.
It is a very great competition with those who come from outside, all the world's producers have put their eyes on Romania, I know these things I told you, and they have special policies.
"At all the fairs is large agglomeration, all the producers exhibit, come entirely the kind of variant," pointed out Mircea Oltean, who specified that IRM Reghin produces around 500 agricultural tractors and forest tractors annually.
By the Rabla programme for tractors, initiated in 2011, those who owned old tractors or other self-propelled means, such as combinations, could surrender them and instead received a value ticket of 17,000 lei.
Red flag raised
The internal election of the workers seems more spectacular and more significant political, as the new leader chooses automatically becomes his point of launching in future elections.
Lift up the red-fired flag. Under his skirts we'll live and die.
That's what Jeremy Corbyn sang yesterday in the London pub Sanctuary House.
There's been a lot of facts and oaths. Let's not change his color now.
Readers who do not know the melodic line of this unofficial anthem of the British and international left (The Red Flag) can search it on the Internet and would not have been excluded to have a surprise.
With discovered heads, let's all swear - that we'll wear it until we collapse.
The author of these lines is not at all an admirer of the red flags (and those that float them), but respects the democratic political traditions built around them.
If Jeremy Corbyn manages to join the left yesterday with the one tomorrow, this love story between him and the Labour Party base will have a happy-end.
I don't think that's going to happen like this, but it seems premature to talk about the great and inevitable electoral defeat, over five years, of a leader chosen earlier.
Now, however, we can refer to procedures: we have witnessed an impressive democratic exercise.
British Labour did not invent the voting system directly for the party leader in the western left.
French Socialists have been practicing for a few years a more complicated, motion-based system that allows the expression of all members and sympathizers; in addition, they have organised a preliminary competition for the nomination of the presidential candidate in 2012.
However, the internal election of the workers seems more spectacular and more significant political, as the new leader chooses automatically becomes his point of launching in future elections.
It is, of course, also a matter of the political system, the customization of power being pronounced more in Britain than on the other side of the Channel of the Hand.
In addition, the participation in the vote was great in all three "searches": members themselves, members of trade unions and other organisations affiliated with the party and, finally, the group of supporters (who received the ballot after a summary registration procedure).
This latter group provides us with interesting information on the perceptions of the left segments of British society, especially those of young or middle-aged people, educated, interested in the political phenomenon.
Many of them will choose to get even more involved, in the future, just because of Corbyn's signal of victory.
There are, as far as I know, sociological surveys that tell us too much about the attitudes of this Labour External Search, so careful speculation is allowed.
I think we meet enough attitudes similar to those of sympathizers Podemos (Spain) or even SYRIZA (Greece), with the observation that they will travel through the traditional channels of the left.
If we want to identify an anti-system vocation, it is primarily reflected by rejecting the centrist line, New Labour (for many, only a disguised form of much-high thatcherism).
The second component would be the rejection of leaders considered guilty of the two successive electoral failures, one of which was that they did not go far enough to the left, that they were not firmly delimited from the time Tony Blair.
The second landmark - after me, and most suggestive - is offered by the recent referendum for Scotland's independence.
If we abstract the separatist message and focus strictly on aspirations on other political issues, we see how Scottish nationalists have captured the energies of public segments favourable to the social state and animated by the aspirations of fairness, followers of disarmament and hostile military involvement across the border, but also sensitive to the new themes of the left: ecology, gender, assistance for poor countries.
The Scottish workers have thus lost an electorate to which they should have, at least in principle, a privileged access, but which they can now recover (see their enthusiasm towards Corbyn's campaign).
Such energy exists everywhere in the United Kingdom, but the old leadership couldn't attract them.
Jeremy Corbyn, with his vocation as an outsider, has more chances of success than Ed Miliband, the Labourist "aristocrat".
The comparison with Scotland tells us more, I think, than the one with the left anti-system in the southern periphery of Europe.
The term "antisystem" is too hard: "anti-establishment" seems more appropriate to me.
By next week we will learn more about Jeremy Corbyn's first steps as leader of the opposition.
We will see if the Red Flag will come back also in the House of Commons (it would not be for the first time), after the new leader has occupied his place, first of all the opposition banks.
Anyway, what Jeremy Corbyn now wants from his colleagues in Parliament is primarily a unit - and in this regard he even has reason to be concerned.
The trap of manipulation with or without good science
As I wrote the article, I was going to go through the story of the former fighter and "Syrian commander Laith Al-Saleh" became part two of the space dedicated by V. Marin to his "jihadist Laith Al-Saleh" (the two categories - "rebel" and "jihadist" - could in itself make me from the circumspect start).
I didn't.
In last week's article (Europe, between refugees and "refugees") we commented in parallel two pictures - that with little Aylan Kurdi found dead on the Mediterranean shore and that in fact: the two showing Syrian Laith Al-Saleh once as a fighter, the second time as a refugee.
The story with Laith Al-Saleh took it from the article "Syrian Fighters Come With the Wave of Refugees" (signed by Viorica Marin in the Truth of 3 September).
Monday night, I posted a link to my article on my Facebook page.
On Tuesday, entering Facebook, I found, among other things, a hand pulling from the friend (not only by FB) Marius Cristian: "Subscribe, but a clarification. Laith of Saleh is not jihadist".
On the contrary, he's a fighter against Al Assad, for democracy and those.
"So you could add and manipulate groolola in the board"!
I have to admit, I felt bad.
The more I wrote the article, the more I thought I'd go through the story of the former fighter and "Syrian rebel commander Laith Al-Saleh" became the second part of V. Marin's dedicated space to his "jihadist Laith Al-Saleh" (the two categories - "rebel" and "jihadist" - could themselves make me from the circumspect start).
Because I trusted the truth, in his journalists.
On the other hand, I had no further comment on Marius Cristian's sleeve pull than this: "That's what I need if I (have) confidence in the Truth"
After that, obviously I've taken the money smaller story and feel indebted to readers with the correct presentation of Syrian Laith Al-Saleh's story.
The oldest one I found in an Associated Press material (Syrian rebel leader looks Europe - Syrian rebel leader seeks Europe) signed by Nicholas Baphitis and Dalton Bennett of 17 August 2015 on the Kos island of Greece, where they noted, among the hundreds, perhaps thousands of refugees, a man trying to make order in the chaos of the crowd.
The man was Syrian stork Laith Al Saleh of Aleppo who "is used to be in command", since "he led a unit of 700 rebels in the civil war in Syria".
We also find that Al Saleh, a 30-year-old, had "a home, a wife and a normal life before the battle began which cost over 250,000 lives and put on the roads a third of the Syrian population."
In the interview given to Associated Press correspondents, Al Saleh tells that "everybody wants to leave Syria".
My city is the most dangerous city in the world.
About 70% of the city is destroyed.
In Syria, Al Qaeda wants me, Daesh (an extremist group of the Islamic State) wants me, the government wants me - I fought against everyone.
Beyond being kicked out of a supermarket on the island, Kos would have offered him "a more sinister encounter - with a man in whom he recognized a Syrian enemy": "Two days ago, I saw a sniper from the government forces."
I didn't talk to him, but I'm still very upset.
From material we also find that Laith (meaning lion in Arabic) was indeed on his way to the Netherlands, where he has a cousin - former senior officer in the Syrian army and then became also rebel and arrived in the West after he was seriously injured - hoping to get asylum and then to bring his family - his wife and a three-year-old boy (nearly an age with the Syrian civil war, which broke out in March 2011).
After this success, Laith Al-Saleh would not have excluded a return to Syria to continue the struggle for the Syrian Free Army (supported by the West) - against three forces: the army of President Bashar Assad (supported by the Russians), the Islamic State and the Nusra Front, affiliated Al-Qaeda.
Crazy - whoever wants freedom must fight in Syria against not one enemy, but the third!
I've gone over a Serbian material of August 22, from which I didn't understand much, only that Laith Al Saleh is associated with terrorists who come along with migrants: TERORISTS SE KRIJU ME falsehood MIGRANTIMA sounds the title of a news on http://www.telegraph.rs/ves, where they are joined a photo with Al Saleh with beard holding a Syrian flag in hand and that of refugee in which he wears the THANK YOU shirt.
On September 7, then, on the BBC website itself, Mike Wendling drew attention to the case of manipulation using photos with Syrian fighter: This viral photo falsely claimed to show an IS fitter posting as a refuge - This viral photo falsely claims that it portrays an Islamic State fighter putting in refuge.
We find out that the photo (in fact: pictures - the one with Laith with beard and gun and the one with the THANK YOU shirt) was posted by a user on Facebook, who would have been using and apologizing in the meantime.
Only before that, just on his wall, the picture with the two pictures would have been shared more than 70,000 times, gathering a few thousand comments.
That word, too late, the horse was gone!
In Romania, on 9 September Carla Dinu from Hotnews takes over the story with the manipulation of the BBC, translating the wrong title: "A false photo became the virus shows an ISIS fighter giving himself as a refugee".
Obviously, photography is not false, but interpretation was a false, wrong, short: manipulative.
