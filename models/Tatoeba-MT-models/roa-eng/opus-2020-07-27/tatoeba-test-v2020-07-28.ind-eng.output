The knife was too blunt until it couldn't be used to cut meat, finally I used my pocket knife.
Over his eyes, blind.
I just don't feel safe here anymore.

Thank you very much.
Yes!
My brother likes music.
It's easy to hang out with Tom.
Want to go home?
Nobody cares about our problems.
What's wrong with you?
I thought I could come this afternoon.
"It's no use waiting for two hours." "Yes, I'll keep this handmark for the rest of my life."
Tom was one of my friends.
Tom sent me thirty more messages yesterday.
I'm just telling Tom what Mary told me.

Tom's getting jealous.
Let me take you home.
Isn't that terrible?
I'll buy this bag for you.
It's too sweet.
I pushed Mary into the water.
Did you ever go to London?
It's our responsibility to help.

When are you going home?
She's sitting around her grandchildren.
The boy was lying in bed for a while.

I really don't understand you.
He's afraid of flying by plane.
I've guessed he's lying, but that doesn't surprise me.

The selection of time is very important.
Tom, are you okay?
We have a lot of furniture.
Health is more important than gold.
I don't think you have any other choice.
I'm not sure what else I should do.
We've done what we can.
Is there another question?
You'll never be alone.
When I walked along this road, I met a woman.
Can't you speak English?
In the light of the laws we all follow, the rich sometimes have more benefits.
He's gonna make it.
I like cats.
The meeting was over at nine o'clock.
Tom was mentally disturbed.
Am I crazy?
We're facing a very difficult winter.
I have to ask, don't I?
Let's find a solution that everyone can accept.
Everyone's ever made a mistake.
You better tell Tom not to do it.
My mom's been gone for ten years.
No one's perfect.
Please go and call for help.
Six degrees below zero.

Brian went to school with Kate.
Why did you stop?
Tom fooled Mary.
No less than 40 percent of students go to university to further education.
Tom put his pencils on the table.
I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Tom lowered his voice so nobody could hear it.
You see anything?
What are you looking at?
Is he long hair?
He greets her every morning, when she enters the school building.
I think he's a doctor.
It's very steep, it's better on the left.
We didn't really see that accident.
His mother was worried about his son.
What operation is being shown at Lincoln Center right now?
I'm tired.

We named that dog Tim.
He opened the letter quickly.
Where's the train station?
Tom demanded Mary to follow him.
It's been eleven hours.

We have to keep working.
The train just left.
Those guys are crazy!
