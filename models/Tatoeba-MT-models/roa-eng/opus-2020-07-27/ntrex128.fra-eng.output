Members of the Assembly of Wales concerned to "pass for puppets"
A proposal to replace their title with the seal MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Welsh Parliament) has been rejected by Welsh elected officials.
This proposal stems from the draft amendment of the Assembly's name, which would become the Welsh Parliament.
In the political sphere, members of the Assembly believe that this could be the subject of railing.
An elected worker said that his group was concerned that the acronym "rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For readers not from Wales: in Welsh, twp means stupid, and pwp means crutte.
According to one of its members, the Plaid Cymru (Party of Wales) is not "satisfied" and has proposed other formulas.
The Conservative party would be "open" to a change of name, but noted that between MWP and Muppet (marionette), the distance is narrow.
In this context, in Welsh, the letter w stands out as the letter or English of the Yorkshire region.
The Committee of the Assembly, which is currently preparing the legislation introducing the change of name, said that “the final decision concerning the designation of members of the Assembly belongs to the latter”.
The Government of Wales Act 2007 (Government of Wales Act 2017) empowers the Welsh Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposal to designate the Assembly as the Welsh Parliament, which was also widely supported.
On the issue of membership titles, the Commission is in favour of Members of the Welsh Parliament (or WMP); however, a vast majority of Welsh prefers MWP.
It seems that the members of the Assembly offer other suggestions, but the effort to reach a consensus could prove to be a real header for Elin Jones, the President of the Assembly, who should submit a bill on the change of name in the coming weeks.
Reform legislation will include further amendments to the functioning of the Assembly, including rules on the exclusion of members and the design of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly will take the final decision on the question of name during the debate on the bill.
Macedonia: Referendum on the Amendment to the Country Name
The Macedonians will decide on Sunday whether their country should now be known as the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to resolve a contentious age of several decades between the country and its Greek neighbour, for whom Macedonia is the name of one of its provinces.
For a long time, Athens has insisted on the fact that the name Macedonia constitutes a claim on its territory and has repeatedly imposed its veto on the accession of its neighbouring country to the European Union and NATO.
The Macedonian President, Gjorge Ivanov, opposed to the referendum, said that he would not take account of the results.
However, supporters such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev maintain that the change of name is only a small price to pay to join the EU and NATO.
Harlem: churches in difficulty, bells of Saint Martin reduced to silence
"The old people I talked to say that traditionally there was a bar and a church on every corner of the street," said Adams.
"There is no more of it today."
According to him, it's normal for the bars to slow down.
Today, "we don't get used in the same way," he explains.
"We used to go to the bar as we did to his neighbor, but that's not the case anymore."
As for the churches, the funds from the sale of buildings will be exhausted long before the leaders imagine themselves, and this worries him: " sooner or later, they will return to the home."
He adds that churches could be replaced by condominium complexes, inhabited by individuals who will not help to maintain the last sanctuaries of the neighborhood.
"The people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be in large part of the Whites who will precipitate the closure of all churches, because it is unlikely that they will become members," he worries.
Before Harlem became a black metropolis, white congregations built both churches: Metropolitan Community in 1870, and Saint Martin 10 years later.
The original white Methodist Congregation abandoned places in the 1930s.
A black congregation, which preached nearby, took possession of the building.
The church of Saint Martin was taken over by a black community under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who initiated a boycott of the shops on 125th Street, one of the main shopping streets in Harlem, in which the Blacks were looking to get used or to get a promotion.
In 1939, a fire ravaged the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners were preparing to rebuild and ordered a new carillon,
Father Johnson's son and successor to the Church of Saint Martin, Reverend David Johnson, proudly called "the bells of the poor people".
Tiffany Ng (University of Michigan), the professional who played it in July, gave her a different name: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
She also mentions that it is the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who, 18 years ago, took place in front of the largest carillon of the Riverside church.
Mr. Merriweather claims Saint Martin didn't replace him.
Over the past few months, there has been a lot of question about the relocation of architects and entrepreneurs, provoked by the secular elite of the church on the one hand, and the episcopal diocese on the other.
In July, the parish council, a leading body made up of lay officials, informed the diocese that it was concerned that the latter wished to impose the costs incurred, even though it did not participate in the recruitment of professionals.
Some parishioners have deplored the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
California: a 13-year-old shark injured during a lobster fishing game
According to the authorities, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old youth last Saturday as he was fishing for lobster, in California on the day of the opening of the season.
The attack occurred just before 7 o'clock in the morning near Beacon beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV, San Diego's television channel, that he had been diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy scream with help and went to pay him to get him out of the water.
At first, Chad thought that the young boy was pushing shouts of joy to have had a hold, then he understood that in reality he
She had been bitten.
On arriving near the young man, Hammel noticed that he had an open fracture of the clavicle.
"I was screaming for everyone to come out of the water: there's a shark!" says Chad.
The boy was evacuated to the Rady Children Hospital in San Diego, where he is still in critical condition.
The shark species at the origin of the attack is not known.
At a press conference, Chief of Relief Larry Giles reported that a shark had been spotted a few weeks earlier, but it was not a dangerous species.
He added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries on the upper torso.
The authorities closed the beach of Ponto Beach in Casablad until that of Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours, to conduct an investigation as well as for safety reasons.
Giles indicated that there are more than 135 shark species, but most of them are considered safe.
Sainsbury's offensive plans in the British aesthetics market
Sainsbury's hand is low on Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams and the garnished of similar rays to those of supermarkets, filled with aesthetics and cosmetics and managed by field specialists.
As a result of a major breakthrough in the British aesthetics market of 2.8 billion pounds sterling, which continues to grow while sales of fashion and household goods are falling, larger beauty product rays will be tested in 11 stores and applied to others if the experience is conclusive.
Supermarkets now invest in the beauty market in order to reuse the space previously occupied by televisions, microwaves and other household items.
Sainsbury's indicated that it would increase the volume of its offers to 3,000 cosmetic items, which will for the first time include brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more space in sectors similar to those of shops such as Boots.
The supermarket also revives its makeup line Boutique to offer a majority of untested products on animals, an increasingly important criterion among young consumers.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop perfumer will test concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first opened last week in Croydon, south of London, and a second of which is scheduled to be opened in the course of the year at Selly Oak (Birmingham).
Supermarket leaders need to dig their heads to attract consumers, who increasingly tend to make their purchases online and go to nearby shops for daily food products.
Mike Coupe, Director General of Sainsbury's, said that sales points will increasingly look like large areas, as the chain of supermarkets tries to counter stores discount Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has set up Argos sales points in hundreds of shops and has also opened the doors of several Habitat stores, since the purchase of the two chains two years ago, which, according to the group, has allowed the sale of common consumer goods and the cost-effective acquisitions.
The previous attempts to restructure the rays of pharmaceutical and cosmetic articles of the British chain had failed.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury's attempted a partnership with Boots, but ended up following a controversy over the distribution of the benefits of pharmacies implanted in supermarkets.
It is after 3 years of selling its 281 pharmacies for an amount of 125 million pounds sterling in Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds pharmaceutical chain, that the new strategy was implemented.
Lloyds had to play a role in it, which included introducing a wide range of high-end skin care brands in 4 stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, announced that the appearance of beauty product rays has been changed in order to improve the clientele framework.
"We have also invested in training so that our staff can provide advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet any type of need and, thanks to the beautification of our rays and the ideal situation of our institutions, our dominance of the cosmetics market is now indisputable and changes the buying habits," said Mills-Hicks.
Peter Jones' anger after Holly Willoughby withdrew from an agreement of £11 million
Curroux de la star du program televisé Dragon's Den, Peter Jones, after the announcement of the withdrawal of the host Holly Willoughby from a contract of £11 million linked to his home decorating brand, to dedicate himself to his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time to take care of Truly interior decoration and accessories brand.
The activity of the two protagonists was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
When she was 37 years old, This Morning's host announced on Instagram that she was withdrawing.
Holly Willoughby angered Peter Jones, the star of Dragon's Den, by withdrawing from their fruitful textile activity and interior decoration at the last minute, to dedicate himself to his new exclusive contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources stated that Jones was furious when the dear child on TV revealed, at a meeting that was under tension at the headquarters of the Star Dragon's Den's commercial empire in Marlow (Buckinghamshire), that his new contracts, at 1.5 million pounds sterling, no longer allowed him to take care of Truly, their brand of decoration and interior accessories.
The Truly brand was similar to that of actress Gwyneth Paltrow, Goop, and could have doubled the value of the owner's fortune estimated at £11 million.
When Willoughby, aged 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones jumped into his private jet to join one of his secondary residences outside Britain.
According to one source, "Truly was by far one of Holly's priorities
and in the process of ensuring its future for the next two decades.
His decision left the whole world with no voice.
No one could imagine what was going to happen on Tuesday, the launch was so close.
Marlow's seat is filled with ready-to-sales products."
Experts believe that the departure of This Morning, one of Britain's most "bankable" celebrities, could cause millions to be lost to society, due to significant investments in products ranging from cushions or candles, to underwear, and the risk of a delayed launch.
On the other hand, it could end a long friendship.
Willoughby and his husband Dan Baldwin, parents of three children, had been friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Holly Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016; Jones, aged 52, joined the group as president in March of the same year.
The couples went on vacation together and Peter Jones owned 40% of the shares in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby should become the brand ambassador for M&S and take the place of Ant McPartlin as animator of the I'm A Celebrity ITV program.
A source close to Jones said last night did not want to comment on his business activities.
The debate was horrid, but we finally love each other.
Trump was ridiculed by the media who criticized him for his comment that some consider "indecent of a president," and to show themselves so positive to the North Korean leader.
"Why did President Trump give in so much?"
By taking a voice from a TV journalist.
"I gave up nothing at all."
He said that Kim Jong-un had shown support for a second meeting, after Trump qualified the first, which took place in Singapore in June, from a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations on this denuclearization are at a dead end.
More than 3 months after the June Summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders on Saturday in the United Nations General Assembly that he did not see any "corresponding response" from the United States to the first disarmament measures in North Korea.
He regretted that, on the contrary, the United States continued to impose sanctions to maintain pressure.
Trump's gathering speech offers a much more optimistic perspective.
"It's all right with North Korea," said the North American President.
We broke through the armed conflict.
"Millions of people would have been killed.
We now have an excellent relationship."
According to Trump, his efforts to improve relations with Kim resulted in positive results: the end of missile tests, the release of hostages and the remnants of North American soldiers rendered to their families.
He also justified his unusual approach to relations with Kim.
"It's so easy to play the role of president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to access this full arena to crack, there's barely more than 200 standing in front of me," he criticized pointing from the finger to the crowd.
Tsunami: a devastated island and hundreds of deaths in Indonesia
After the earthquake that shook Lombok, the assistance of foreign NGOs was not supposed to be necessary.
More than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok has disappeared, but no state of national disaster has been established, a condition required for the initiation of international aid.
"Unfortunately, they have repeatedly made it clear that they did not want international aid, which makes things a little more difficult," said Mrs.Sumung.
While Save the Children is setting up a team to go to Palu, she still does not know whether work on the ground will be allowed.
The spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, Mr. Sutopo, said that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to humanitarian assistance.
Despite constant shocks, the country lacks cruel means to protect itself from the whims of nature.
Refugees have been set up in Aceh, but are rare in other coastal areas.
Although a warning was given, no alarm siren remained in Palu, which probably contributed to human losses.
Even in ideal conditions, moving from one Indonesian island to the other is not a simple thing.
Natural disasters further complicate the use of transport.
A hospital ship that had been sent to Lombok to treat the victims is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least 3 days to reach the sites of the new disaster.
The Indonesian President, Joko Widodo, placed the infrastructure reform in the centre of his electoral campaign and spent considerable sums on restoring roads and railways.
However, the lack of funds has undermined Mr. Joko's government, called upon to be represented before the electors next year.
The Indonesian head of state is also under pressure from the persistence of inter-ethnic tensions in the country, where members of the Islamic majority practice their faith more conservatively.
More than a thousand Indonesians have lost their lives and tens of thousands have been thrown out of their homes, in the background of clashes in the streets between Christians and Muslims, armed with machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
Watch: Liverpool attacker Daniel Sturridge manages to equalize against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved a defeat in Liverpool in the First League against Chelsea, marking at the 89th minute on Saturday in Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while it was about 30 metres away from Chelsea's goals, and his team was led from 1 to 0.
He shoots in the ball on his left, before he escapes a shot to the second pole.
The balloon flew over the repair surface before heading to the upper right corner of the net.
The ball ends up reaching Kepa Arrizabalaga and ends its road at the bottom of the cage.
"I was just trying to place myself, to take the ball, but players like Shaq always pull as far away as possible, so I tried to make a maximum of time," trusts Sturridge at LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw that Kante was approaching to control and without really thinking much I decided to shoot."
Chelsea led 1 to 0 in mid-time after a goal of Belgian star Eden Hazard at the 25th minute.
The Blues attacker scored a step towards Mateo Kovacic before heading to the middle of the ground and sprinting on the side of Liverpool.
Kovacic made a quick trip and comes in the middle of the ground,
Then he makes a beautiful deep shot that kills Hazard in the surface.
Hazard passed the defense and finished his race in the net of the second pole, with a shot from the left foot behind the porter of Liverpool, Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face the Napolitains in the Champions League group phase, Wednesday at 3:00 p.m. at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in Europe UEFA League, at 3 p.m. this Thursday in London.
Indonesia: Number of tsunami victims: 832
The Disaster Management Agency reported on Sunday morning that the earthquake and tsunami balance sheet reported 832 deaths.
Many residents are trapped under the debris of the buildings destroyed by the magnitude of 7.5 earthquake that shook the country Friday and triggered the waves of 6 meters high, informed the spokesman of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho during a press conference.
With more than 380,000 inhabitants, the city of Palu was surrounded by debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man suspected of stabbing a woman
A murder investigation was opened after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead (Merseyside) this morning.

The police urge the residents of the neighborhood who would have seen or heard something to give their testimony.
The police captain Brian O'Hagan made the following statements: "The investigation just started, but I would like to ask anyone around John Street in Birkenhead who would have seen or heard any suspect contact us.
In particular, I call on taxi drivers, who could have captured something about their Dashcam and asked them to provide us with all the crucial information for our investigation."
A police spokesperson confirmed that the murdered woman was found in a Birkenhead property in which she resided.
This morning, people claiming to know the woman showed up at the crime scene and asked questions about where she was discovered.
The investigation is ongoing and the police indicated that it informed the parents of the victim.
A taxi driver has just seen himself refuse access to his apartment in Grayson Mews, the police do not allow anyone to enter or leave the building.
The news left him voiceless.
Residents have just been informed that the building would be inaccessible for several hours.
A police officer confirmed that the entire sector was considered a crime scene.

Parliament: Cromwell's statue, the last victim of an attempt to rewrite history
Its prohibition would be the right return of things, in the light of acts of destruction, of countless religious and cultural goods of England, committed by its Puritan supporters, such as the fanatic Taliban.
However, the Cromwell Society considers Mr. Crick's proposal "unreasonable" and called it "revisionist attempt".
The president of the Cromwell Society, John Goldsmith, states that "in view of the current debate around the withdrawal of statues, it was evident that Oliver Cromwell's one erected before the Palace of Westminster would not be spared.
Cromwell did not order or conduct the iconoclasm during the English civil wars.
It is likely that his person was sacrificed for the actions committed by his ancestor Thomas during the previous century.
The superb representation of Cromwell, sculpted by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, attests to the consideration we had for him in the 19th century and belongs to the historiography of a personality that many of us still celebrate."
Mr. Goldsmith said the following words at Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of Parliament against external pressures, I mean of course monarchy.
Whether this representation is accurate or not is a continuous historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict that broke out in the middle of the 17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a particularly recognizable figure that represents a side of the fracture.
Its achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be highlighted and commemorated."
China: A Pig Kills a Farmer · Global Voices
According to local media, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southeast China.
Identified as M, Yuan, the man was found dead, the artery trenched and covered with blood near a pig shop on the market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou, reported on Sunday the South China Morning Post.
A pig breeder is preparing to inject pig vaccines into a pig shop on May 30, 2005 in Xining in the Province of Qinghai, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from the nearby province of Yunnan on Wednesday, with the aim of selling 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found out that a door to the nearby porch was open.
He claims that a huge male pig was inside and that blood flowed from his mouth.
A medical-legal report confirms that the animal weighs 250 kg has mutilated the livestock to death.
According to Guiyang Evening News, Mr. Wu, the farmer's cousin, said that "his legs were crushed and covered with blood."
The security cameras show Mr. Yuan arriving at the market at 4:40 p.m. on Thursday to feed his animals.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The pig that caused Mr. Yuan's death belonged neither to the farmer nor to his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the animal was locked up to prevent any other incident and allow the police to collect evidence.
The farmer's family Mr. Yuan and market leaders would be negotiating compensation.
Although the facts are rare, pig attacks on people have already been reported.
In 2016 in a Massachusetts farm, a pig assaulted a woman and her husband, seriously hurting the latter.
Ten years earlier, a 295 kg pig hanged a Welsh breeder on his tractor before his wife managed to get him away.
In 2012, while a Oregon breeder had just been devoured by his pigs, a Manitoba farmer said to CBC News that it is not in principle an aggressive animal, but that the taste of blood can cause this type of behaviour.
"They are rather players animals,
Very curious kids... they have no intention of doing any harm.
Just show them the respect they deserve," he assures.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa are expected to cause heavy rainfall in the south-east of the United States
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves over the colder waters of the north-east coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will cause flooding in northeastern Mexico and southwest of the United States in the coming days.
The winds were at 135 km/h (category 1 hurricane) since 5:00 a.m. on Sunday, while Rosa was at 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The hurricane should travel north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression begins to develop above the Pacific Ocean and moves eastwards to the west coast of the United States. As it approaches the Lower California Peninsula on Monday in storm form, Hurricane Rosa will lead to intense tropical humidity to the North in the southwestern United States.
It will fall up to 25 cm of rain in regions of Mexico this Monday.
Then, tropical humidity combined with the near depression will create torrential rains widespread in the south-west in the coming days.
At the local level, precipitation reaching between 2.5 and 10 cm will cause sudden storms, debris leaks and potential landslides in the desert.
The floods will reach a rate of 5 to 7.5 cm per hour per place, especially in the south of Nevada and Arizona, due to the intensity of tropical humidity.
It is expected to fall between 5 and 10 cm of rain in southwest regions, including a large part of Arizona.
Disseminated tropical rains may cause sudden flooding and rapid deterioration of conditions.
It is strongly advised to venture into the desert on foot because of the threat of tropical precipitation.
Intensive rains could convert the canyons into distant rivers and storms will produce wind gusts and dust peats in places.
The approaching depression will give rise to abundant local rains in some southern parts of the country, on the Californian coast.
The total rainfall can reach more than 1.3 cm, which could cause low debris flows and make the heat slide.
These could be the first rains of the dry season of the region.
Dispersed tropical storms will reach Arizona on Sunday at the end of the day and early Monday morning, and will intensify later Monday and Tuesday.
High rainfall will fall at four corners of the country on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
Important temperature changes are expected for the month of October across the United States due to the cooling of the Arctic, but the climate of the tropics will remain warm,
which sometimes causes a radical change of time over short distances.
The central region of the United States, which will face considerable temperature differences on Sunday, is a perfect example of this.
Between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, or between Saint Louis and Des Moines (Iowa), the difference is almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, a persistent summer heat will attempt to infiltrate and intensify again.
Most of the central and eastern United States should know a start of hot October, with temperatures around 26 degrees covering the plains of the south and other regions of the north-east.
Mercury could reach 26 degrees in New York Tuesday, about 10 degrees above the average of the season.
Forecasts over several days indicate that temperatures should be higher than average in the eastern United States during the first quarter of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's trial attracts more than 20 million viewers
Transmitted on 6 television channels Thursday, the compelling hearings of Brett Kavanaugh, candidate for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused her of sexually assaulting her in the 1980s, were followed by more than 20 million people.
While the political impasse continues, the broadcasting services interrupted their usual program on Friday to announce a theatrical coup: an agreement imagined by Jeff Flake, the Senator of Arizona, to allow the FBI to conduct an investigation into the charges for a week.
In front of the Senate Judicial Commission, Christine Ford assured 100 per cent that Kavanaugh, as a result of his alcohol, had committed suicides on his person and had attempted to remove his clothes during a high school night.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate raid, also claimed to be 100% certain that this had never happened.
According to a Nielsen report, the trial has likely reached an audience of more than 20.4 million people.
The company calculated the number of viewers from CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures from other channels spreading the trial, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen is not always able to estimate the number of people watching TV at the office.
By comparison, the trial attracted as many people as a football match or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose facilitators widely supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, was the most watched channel on the day of the auditions, with an average of 5.69 million viewers.
ABC held second place with a hearing reaching 3.26 million.
They followed CBS (3.1 million), NBC (2.94 million), MSNBC (2.89 million) and CNN (2.52 million), always according to Nielsen.
The interest did not weaken once the hearing was completed.
Flake was at the center of the drama that was playing Friday.
After the Bureau of the Moderate Republic of Canada issued a statement that it would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras revealed a scene in which the senator was taken part by protesters while attempting to take the elevator to the court hearing.
Flake lowered her eyes for several minutes, while CNN retransmitted the sequence of the live inquiry.
"Don't look elsewhere, look at me," launches one of the women.
"Do you really think he's telling the truth?
You hold power while so many women are poor."
Before the elevator doors were closed, Flake indicated that his office had issued a statement and that he would say more at the committee meeting.
All wired and broadcast network channels covered the live session a few hours later, while the judicial commission was preparing to vote on the procedure to advance the appointment of Kavanaugh by the whole Senate.
Flake, however, indicated that a one-week inquiry should first be conducted by the FBI on charges made against the candidate, which the minority democrats claimed.
Flake was partly convinced by discussions with his friend, Senator Chris Coons.
He made his decision after he met with Coons and several other senators later.
His choice weighed heavily on the balance, as the Republicans did not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh's appointment without a prior inquiry.
President Trump authorized the FBI to investigate Brett Kavanaugh's sexual assault charges.
Great Britain: May accuses the opponents of making "small politics"
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused the detractors of his project of leaving the European Union, making the "small policy" to the detriment of the future of Britain and the national interest.
May arrived at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In another exchange with the newspaper, which published a photo of Theresa May in cover, his former foreign minister, Boris Johnson continued his attacks on his so-called Chequer plans, claiming that the proposal for free trade between Great Britain and the European Union was "self ridiculous".
Wayde Sims: Police Stop Dyteon Simpson, suspected of causing the death of the LSU player
Police arrested a fatal shot suspect who led to the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, also 20 years old, was beaten and charged with murder in the second degree, reported Baton Rouge Police Service.
The authorities published a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police reported that Sims had lost his glasses during the altercation.
Found at the crime scene, the glasses wore Simpson's DNA, according to WAFB, a subsidiary of the CBS group.
During his interrogation, Simpson confessed to the police to be responsible for Wayde's death.
According to his lawyer, his bail was set at $350,000.
The office of the medical examiner of the parish of Baton-Rouge published a preliminary report Friday, which determines that death was caused by an injury by a bullet that crossed the head and lodged in the neck.
The Police Service recognizes the assistance received by the Louisiana State's Fugitive Task Force, the state police's medical-legal laboratory, the Southern University police, as well as citizens, in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the law enforcement forces for their "commitment and quest for justice".
Sims was only 20.
1.98 m for 98 kg, the player grew up in Baton-Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
On average, he scored 5.6 points and performed 2.6 rebounds per match in the last season.
On Friday morning, Will Wade, LSU basketball coach said the team was "damaged and shocked" after the news of Wayde's death.
"We spend all the time this kind of event," regretted Wade.
Mexico: A Volcano Cracked Ash
From the ashes escaping from the volcano Popocatepetl reached the southern districts of the capital of Mexico.
On Saturday, the National Disaster Reduction Centre recommended that Mexicans move away from the volcano, after having recorded a peak of activity in the crater, with 183 emissions of gas and ash in 24 hours.
The centre monitored several earthquakes and earthquakes from the Popocatepetl.
On social media, images showed fine layers of ash covering windshields of cars in Mexico City neighborhoods, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists observed an increase in activity at the volcano level located 72 km from the capital, since an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 shook the centre of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, named Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Catalonia: clashes between the police and separatists in the approach of the anniversary of the vote for independence
On Saturday, six arrests took place in Barcelona after clashes between independent protesters and the riot police, while thousands of opponents joined protests to mark the first anniversary of the referendum that divided Catalonia.
Before being refouled by riot police, masked separatists threw eggs and colored powder, creating dust clouds in the streets, which usually do not defuse tourists.
Heats also broke out later in the day, while police were using bats to contain confrontations.
For several hours, groups in favour of independence that scandalized "neither forget nor forgive" have faced unionist supporters shouting "long-live in Spain".
14 protesters who had minor injuries were treated according to the local press.
A year after the referendum of 1 October, which was considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by Catalans in favour of separation, tensions remain alive in the independentist region.
A overwhelming majority of voters chose independence, despite a low rate of participation, the opponents of secession who largely boycotted the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police attempted to prevent Catalans from accessing polling offices in the region.
Independent groups had camped on Friday night to block a demonstration of support for the national police.
It was the same place, but it was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated with his wife in the separatist demonstration, said he had no hope for the independence of Catalonia.
"We were witnesses last year of a great time.
My parents cried for joy at the idea of being able to vote, but now we are in an impasse," he laments.
Despite their capital victory, although thin, in the regional elections last December, the independent Catalan parties had a hard time maintaining momentum this year, with many popular leaders being exiled or detained pending trial for organizing the referendum and declaring Catalonia's independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, who filmed the demonstration of police support on his phone, finds that politicians are responsible for blocking the situation, on the one hand as well as on the other.
"The tension is only rising," he regrets.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the 9 Catalan leaders in prison awaiting a trial since last year, announced his intention to run for the European Parliament elections next year.
"It is for me the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and repression triggered by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry arrest: Men hit a house by car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after having sunk several times over a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7:30 p.m. local time.
Police captain Bob Blemmings indicated that the doors and walls were damaged.
The car would have also received arrow shots.
Livingston wins the 1 to 0 match against the Rangers thanks to Menga
Dolly Menga's first goal assures Livingston's victory
The Livingston team recently climbed to the rank, surprised the Rangers by imposing a second victory in 18 games at Steven Gerrard, the current coach at the Ibrox Club.
Menga's goal made all the difference and allowed Gary Holt's team to place in 2nd ranking position, equal with Hibernian.
Gerrard's men are out on Premiership's league this season, and they have to face on Sunday the Hearts team, which carries 8 points.
But first, the Rangers will meet the Vienna Rapid on the occasion of the Europe League on Thursday.
As for the Livingston team, it has extended its six-game course in the division, and its main coach Holt, who has replaced Kenny Miller since last month, can boast that he hasn't lost the slightest meeting yet.
Livingston missed an opportunity in the face of angry opponents
Holt's team could have gone ahead long before they scored, because their direct approach was putting the Rangers in trouble.
Scott Robinson tried to lose but remained stuck in front of the opposing goal; followed by a late intervention by Alan Lithgow, on a head pass by Craig Halkett.
Livingston's team let the Rangers own the ball, knowing that they could be bothered by the tactics they worked on.
That's where the decisive goal comes from.
The Rangers gave a free shot and the Livingston attempted an opening; Declan Gallagher and Robinson allied themselves to match Menga, who took a touch and enrolled a goal in the middle of the field.
At this stage, the Rangers dominated the game but found themselves facing an impenetrable defense and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly was only rarely worried.
The second half-time had the same pace, although Alfredo Morelos had forced a Kelly stop.
Rangers Allan McGregor stopped a hit by Scott Pittman, while Lithgow managed to play one of Livingston's plans.
Livingston's guard repelled all attempts and protected his cage, while two penalties were refused by the referee, one for the provocation of Halkett led against Glenn Middleton and the other for a fault of hand.
Livingston's " phenomenon" - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland, Tony Macaroni Arena
A performance and stunning results for Livingston.
They have all been excellent and continue to exceed expectations on this ascending slope.
Their style and composition of the team have hardly changed since their return to the top, but the merit largely goes back to Holt for having since his arrival motivated a team
that counts many great players.
Captain Halkett's defense was grand and beautifully organized, and Menga had her hold Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in hale throughout the game.
Unfortunately, the Rangers were not inspired.
Despite a good level with Gerrard, they did not live up to their past talent.
They missed a last chance and managed to perch the opposite side only once; this is a warning for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the picture.
Mixed home of President Erdogan in Cologne
On Saturday 29 September, the Turkish and German leaders met around breakfast in Berlin in a relaxed atmosphere.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aimed to improve relations between NATO allies.
Various issues have been addressed, such as human rights, press freedom or Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then flew to Cologne for the inauguration of one of the largest mosques.
One of the largest Turkish communities abroad lives in this city.
On security grounds, the police prevented 25,000 protesters from gathering in front of the building, while many supporters were able to approach to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, mostly Kurds, heard their voices, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome them in his country.
The cleavage that emerges from protests reflects this double vision of Erdogan: a visitor received in heroes by some Germans of Turkish origin and qualified as an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies after a collision with a car
In London, a cyclist died in a collision involving a car.
The accident occurred about 10:15 a.m. local time, near the junction between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a frequent road from Deptford to the southeast of the city.
The vehicle driver stopped, the rescues arrived on site, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
This accident occurred several months after the death of a cyclist on Chiders Street, about 1.5 km from the accident that took place on Saturday.
The London police stated that officers were doing everything to identify the individual and prevent his or her loved ones.
Roads have been closed and bus deviations have been put in place and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Prison Long Lartin: 6 officers injured in riots
The head of the prison for high-security men said that six prison officers had been injured during a riot.
The riot began in HMP Long Lartin Prison, located in Worcestershire, about 9:30 a.m. local time this Sunday. It is still not under control.
Anti- riot specialist officers were sent to unlock the situation, involving 8 detainees and contained in a prison wing.
On site, agents were treated for minor facial injuries.
A spokesperson for the prison management said: "Specially trained personnel were deployed to restore order in HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six agents were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons; those responsible will have to respond to the police authorities and will be able to see their sentences extended."
Over 500 prisoners, including criminals considered the most dangerous in the country, are imprisoned in HM Long Lartin Prison.
In June, the prison warden was hospitalized as a result of an assault by a prisoner.
In October last year, rioters were sent to prison to prevent a serious disturbance: prisoners had attacked personnel with billiard balls.
Uragan Rosa: Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City threatened by sudden storms (which could be beneficial for drought-affected areas)
It is rare that a tropical depression affects Arizona, but that is what is likely to happen at the beginning of next week. Hurricane Rosa is heading for the southwest desert with what remains of energy. This region could be affected by sudden storms.
The national weather service has already issued flood alerts for Monday and Tuesday to the west of Arizona, the south and east of Nevada, the southeast of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa should head straight to Phoenix on Tuesday, with rains announcing from Monday night.
The Phoenix-based national weather service said in a tweet that "only ten tropical cyclones have preserved the stage of depression or tropical storm in a 300 km perimeter around Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) stopped at 64 km from the Arizona border."
The latest estimates at the National Hurricane Center include 5 to 10 cm of precipitation, and up to 15 cm of precipitation by places in the Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other parts of the southwest desert, including the central area of the Rockies and the Grand Bassin, are expected to record 2.5 to 5 cm of precipitation, with total isolated measurements up to 10 cm.
Rosa's rains could be lifesaving for drought-affected areas that are not exposed to the risk of sudden flood.
Although the risk of flooding should not be taken lightly, rain could be beneficial for the southwest region, given the current drought situation.
According to the U.S. drought monitoring system, a little over 40% of Arizona knows at least one drought of extreme category, the second most serious category," saysweather.com.
The Rosa hurricane begins its journey on the coasts, in the peninsula of Basse-California.
Still of great power on Sunday morning and generating winds up to 135 km/h, Rosa was located 620 km from Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and travels north at the speed of 20 km/h.
The storm encounters the cold waters of the Pacific and thus loses its strength.
It is expected to reach the Mexican coast with the strength of a hurricane Monday afternoon or Monday evening.
In some regions of Mexico, precipitation may be massive and could lead to a flood risk.
"In total, between 7.5 and 15 cm of precipitation are expected from Lower California to the north-west of Sonora and can reach up to 25 cm," saidweather.com.
Rosa will then cross Mexico north, with the strength of a tropical storm, and reach the Arizona border on Tuesday, early in the morning, as a tropical depression. She will cross Arizona and southern Utah in the Tuesday evening.
"Round rains are expected in Basse-California, north-west of Sonora and the southwest desert and constitute the main danger," explained the National Hurricane Center.
It is estimated that these precipitations will result in potentially deadly storms and debris flows in arid areas, as well as landslides in mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on charges of attempted murder, after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in the Somerset.
The teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace district of Midsomer Norton, Saturday around 4am local time.
He was sent to the hospital, and his condition is stable.
The Avon and Sommerset police reported arresting the four young people (aged 17, 18 and 20 years) in the night of Radstock.
Officers made a call to people who might have filmed the scene with their phones.
Trump states that Kavanaugh has been the victim of the wickedness and anger of democrats
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and scandalous methods of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a gathering in Wheeling in West Virginia.
Trump claimed that Kavanaugh had been the victim of the wickedness and anger of the democrats throughout his appointment process.
Kavanaugh spoke to Congress Thursday, rejecting the allegations of Christine Blasey Ford, who accused her of sexually assault several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing.
The president declared on Saturday that "the American people witnessed Kavanaugh's intelligence and courage" today.
"A vote in the sense of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote in the sense of one of the most accomplished jurists, with a brilliant career in public service," he explained to the crowd of supporters gathered in Virginia-Western.
The president referred indirectly to the appointment of Kavanaugh when he referred to the importance of Republican participation in mid-term elections.
"We are five weeks from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I am not a candidate, but I am more involved than ever," he said.
"That's why I fight on all fronts for formidable candidates."
Trump said democrats were on mission of "resistance and obstruction".
The first vote of decisive procedure in the Senate for the appointment of Kavanaugh should take place by Friday, according to the statement of a collaborator of the Republican Party in CNN.
Indonesia: One earthquake and tsunami make hundreds of victims, the balance is constantly rising
On Saturday, the authorities stated that at least 384 people had died, most of them carried by huge waves that fell on the beaches while an earthquake, followed by a tsunami, struck the Indonesian island of Celebes.
On Friday, hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in Palu, when waves of six meters high submerged the beach at the fall of the night. They took many lives and destroyed everything on their way.
The earthquake, magnitude 7.5, preceded the tsunami.
"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, everyone was still on the beach. People did not flee immediately, it cost them their lives," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for the National Agency for Disaster Management (BNPB), at a press conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't happen alone. He trained cars, wooden pieces, dwellings, he took everything with him," Nugroho explained, stating that the tsunami had moved to the sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people have been able to save their lives by climbing to the trees, he adds.
Nearly 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Air images published by the disaster management agency show destroyed buildings and shops, broken and broken bridges, as well as a water mosque.
The replicas continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
Earthquakes have been felt by 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technologies (BPPT) stated that the energy released by the earthquake on Friday was 200 times greater than the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographic location of the city, which borders a long narrow bay, could have widened the size of the tsunami, she explained.
According to Nugroho, the damage is considerable; thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels have collapsed.
Some bodies were found trapped under the debris of buildings in ruins, he added, stating that 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho stated that human and material losses could be greater over 300 km of coastline north of Palu, a region called Donggala, the closest to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications were "completely paralysed" since Donggala said Nugroho.
More than 300,000 people live there," said La Croix Rouge in a communiqué, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to affected areas.
"The situation is dramatic and could get worse," she added.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticised for not disseminating information that a tsunami had affected Palu, although officials stated that the waves had arrived as soon as the alert was published.
A shared amateur video on social networks shows a man on the floor of a building crying freneticly to street passers-by that a tsunami approaches.
A few minutes later, a wall of water fell on the coast, carrying buildings and cars with it.
Reuters was not able to immediately authenticate the images.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a general power loss that cut off all communications in Palu, so it was difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
The army began to provide cargo aircraft support from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but the evacuated people still need food and other basic needs.
The city airport has reopened as part of relief operations, but will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia: There are over 800 deaths in the balance of tsunami victims.
It's a tragedy.
The staff of World Vision of Donggala arrived healthy and except in Palu, where they found refuge in shelters located in the court of their offices. On the way, they discovered scenes of devastation, explains Mr. Doseba.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
It's a tragedy.
When aid groups began to provide relief to the injured, some complained that highly experienced foreign humanitarian workers had not had the right to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funds, supplies and personnel may enter the territory only if the affected site is declared a national disaster zone.
And that's not the case yet.
"This disaster is still considered regional," says Auli Arriani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government declares that this is a national disaster, international assistance can intervene, but we are still waiting."
When the second night after the earthquake and the Friday tsunami fell on Palu, the missing relatives were still waiting for a miracle.
On Saturday, a little boy was found in the sewers.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman buried under the debris for two days, near her mother's body.
The coach of the Indonesian National Paragliding Team, Gendon Subandono, had prepared two of the missing athletes for the Asian Games, which took place a few days earlier in Indonesia.
Others of his students found themselves trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, added M. Mandagi.
"As an old man in the paragliding discipline, I experienced my own dramas," he explains.
In the hours that followed the announcement of the collapse of the Roa Roa Roa Hotel in the paragliding community, Mr. Gendon said that he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to athletes in Palu who participated in the festival on the beach.
His messages were left unanswered.
"I believe they have never received my messages."
In Newport on the Levee, thieves subtlet $26,750 when reloading an automatic distributor
On Friday morning, thieves extorted $26,750 to a Brink's agent who recharged an automatic distributor at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Service.
The vehicle driver lived a distributor in the entertainment complex and prepared to feed it, explains Inspector Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
While he was busy, a man appeared behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of money for the distributor.
Witnesses reportedly noticed many suspects leaving the premises, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Any person with information about their identities is requested to contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name and becomes Ye
The Kanye West rapper is now called Ye.
To announce the news on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "Anciently known as Kanye West."
A 41-year-old West, who has been called Ye for some time, used this nickname as a title for his eighth album, released in June.
The rapper made this change just before he went to the Saturday Night Live show, where he should present his new album, Yandhi.
His participation replaced that of Ariana Grande, who cancelled his arrival for "emotional reasons," explained the creator of the show.
In addition to being the abbreviation of his current pseudo-professional, this nickname also has a religious significance for West.
"I think "Ye" is the most used word in the Bible, where it means "you," explained West earlier this year, referring to the title of his album with his host Big Boy.
"Then I'm you, I'm us.
I went from Kanye, which means "the only one," to Ye - reflects it of good, evil, confusion, of everything.
This album is a reflection of who we are."
West is not the only rapper known to change his name.
Sean Combs was called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has collaborated with West in the past, has also played on union trait and capitalization.
In Mexico, AMLO states that he will never resort to military force against civilians.
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use military force against civilians, almost fifty years after bloody reprisals from law enforcement against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday in Tlatelolco's place "never use military force to suppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the troops opened fire at a peaceful demonstration, killing 300 people at the time of student movements taking root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador committed to supporting Mexican youth by granting monthly student allowances and opening more free public universities.
According to him, unemployment and lack of educational opportunities lead young people to join criminal gangs.
The United States should double funding in the field of artificial intelligence
While China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its research funding in this sector, according to the AI investor and expert Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These statements occur after several US government actors have made announcements about AI, while an official AI strategy is lacking in the United States.
In parallel, China presented its road map last year: it plans to become the leader in innovation by 2030.
"double the funds for AI research would be a good start, because all other countries have a long lead on the United States, and we are looking for the next big discovery in AI," says Lee.
Double the funds could double the chances that the next key step in the U.S. AI area, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Innovation Ventures, who invested in one of China's largest AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at the University of Carnegie Mellon, he worked on an AI system that beat the best-class American Othello player. He then integrated Microsoft Research's management team and became president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee has already participated in technological competitions organized by the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge of Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when the next competition would be held, to identify visionaries.
According to Lee, American researchers often have to work hard to obtain funding from the government.
"It's not China that owns academic leaders, it's business," Lee says.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited major academic names to work on AI.
Lee added that the changes in immigration policies could also support the efforts of the United States in the area of AI.
"I think green cards should be automatically given to AI researchers," he says.
The State Affairs Council of China unveiled its new generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
China's National Natural Sciences Foundation provides funding to members of academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower," Lee explained.
Earlier in the year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which must involve industry and academic partners. The White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF currently invests more than $100 million per year in AI research.
At the same time, the US legislation working to establish a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not taken any action for several months.
Macedonians participate in the referendum on their country's name
On Sunday, the Macedonians heard their voices in a referendum on the change of their country's name for the Republic of North Macedonia, which would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece, which blocked Macedonia's application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, whose name is Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbour represents a right on its territory and opposed its veto to its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, both governments signed an agreement based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change would affect the ethical identity of the slave population in Macedonia, the majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov announced that he would not vote in the referendum and that a boycotting campaign had raised doubts as to whether a minimum 50 per cent participation was required to validate the referendum.
The question of the referendum was: "Are you for NATO and EU membership under the terms of the agreement signed with Greece?"
According to supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, this is the price to be paid to join organisations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, which have been overcome by the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I have come today to vote for the future of my country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that it can live freely under the aegis of the European Union, which means a safer life for each of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, enough members of the parliament have stated that they would follow the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The change in the name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The Electoral Commission of State announced that no irregularities had been detected at 13 a.m.
But participation was only 16%, while it had reached 34% at the same time during the last parliamentary elections in 2016, which had mobilized 66% of voters registered at the end of the election.
"I came to vote for my children. Our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko participated in the referendum and voted for the change of name, in order to open the voice to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepares a small stage and has seats in front of tents installed by those who will boycott the referendum.
"We want to enter the EU and NATO, but we want to enter it through the big door," said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't want us as Macedonia, we can turn to China and Russia and participate in Eurasian integration."
According to Prime Minister Zaev, accession to NATO will allow Macedonia to receive the necessary investments, and the unemployment rate in the country exceeds 20%.
"I think a large majority will be in favour, because more than 80% of our citizens want to join the EU and NATO," said Mr. Zaev after filing his newsletter.
He added that a "yes" would be a "confirmation of our future".
According to a poll published on Monday by the Institute for Policy Research in Macedonia, between 30 and 43 per cent of the voters intend to participate in the referendum, which is below the expected participation rate.
Another survey, organized by the Macedonian chain Telma, estimated participation to 57 per cent.
70% of participants intending to vote said they would vote "yes".
For the referendum to be valid, it takes 50 per cent of the votes plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first major blow to pro-West government policy since its seizure in May last year.
Decisive action : Sergio Aguero, Manchester City, breaks a path through Brighton's defense to mark
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton's defenders in Manchester and won the 2-0 game on Saturday at Manchester's Etihad Stadium.
The goal of Aguero, at the 65th minute, seemed to be the simplest action in the world for the player.
The Argentine Butter received the ball in the middle of the field, at the beginning of the action.
He ran between three Brighton defenders before diving on the ground.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green jerseys.
He crossed a defender before evinating others close to Brighton's goal.
Then he passed the ball to Sterling on his left.
The English front took advantage of it to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to deceive Brighton's keeper, Mathew Ryan, with a shot on the right side of the net.
"Aguero has some problems with his feet," explained Pep Guardiola, the team coach, to journalists.
"We said he'd be 55.60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored at the time."
But it was Sterling who had given the original advantage to Skyblues during the First League match,
From the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball directly on Brighton's field.
He sent it to Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane made a few keys before taking Sterling to the second pole.
The front of the Skyblues sent the ball into the nets just before sliding out of the field.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League at 12.55 a.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play the party disorder against the Rockies
As the Nationals team was eliminated from the play-off race, there was no reason to start a new game.
But Scherzer, very competitive, hopes to play Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only in the case of the hijacking game for the Rockies, of true legends facing the Los Angeles Dodgers of the West Division of the National League.
The Rockies took it 5-2 in front of the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still trying to secure their first division title.
"Even though this game is not at stake, we want to crowd the ground in Denver, with this atmosphere, with the crowd, and in front of a team that will probably play at the highest level I will have to face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to participate?"
Nationals still need to announce a launcher starting for Sunday, but they would be inclined to leave the place in Scherzer, in this situation.
Scherzer, for whom it would be the 34th departure, will be in training Thursday and launch on his usual day of rest, Sunday.
The Washington Lawyer is 18-7 with an average of 2,53 and 300 points worth on catch in 220 marches and two-thirds this season.
Trump's interventions in West Virginia
The president alluded to the situation that generated his support to Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court by speaking about the importance of Republican participation in mid-term elections.
“All our actions will have an impact in November.
We are five weeks from one of the most important elections of our lives.
It's a major issue. I'm not a candidate, but I'm more involved than ever. That's why I fight on all fronts for formidable candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "You see this terrible radical group, really horrible democrats, you see it at work.
And they are determined to regain power by all means. See their wickedness.
They care about whom they hurt, about whom they crush to take power and control. That is what they want, power and control, and we are not going to give them."
Democrats are on mission of "resistance and obstruction".
"You can see it over the last four days," he added, before qualifying the democrats of people "in anger, wicked and lying."
He referred to the Judicial Committee of the Senate of the United States and the Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which was worthy of public attention.
"Do you remember his answer?"
Did you disclose the document?
Ha ha, of course.
No, no, I'm waiting for one. It was a very bad body language, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer the great community it was.
He is not tolerant of those who express their ideas.
When activists from the Momentum movement of my local party voted to censor me, it was not a surprise.
After all, I am the last of a line of parliamentarians of the Labour Party considered as not welcome, all for having expressed our ideas.
My Parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was treated the same way because she was against anti-Semitism.
As far as I'm concerned, I was convicted because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically, these are subjects for which Jeremy himself disagreed with the previous leaders.
The notification for the Nottingham East Labour gathering Friday said: "We want the assembly to be inclusive and productive."
That's exactly what the Friday evening general assemblies were for my eight years as a Labour Party Member.
Unfortunately, today this is not the case with many gatherings and the promise of more gentle and more respectful policies has long been forgotten, if ever taken into account.
It has become evident that the opposing opinions are no longer tolerated within the party. Each opinion is judged to be acceptable by the party's leaders.
This started shortly after Jeremy took over. Members with whom I was thinking of sharing a political vision began to wait for me to return my jacket and take positions as opposed to my convictions, whether it be about national security or the EU's internal market.
Every time I spoke publicly, and no matter what I said, I was taking an abusive raid on social networks, calling for the withdrawal, denouncing the policies of the centre, telling me that I should not be a member of the party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments that were addressed to me were of a political nature.
I am in awe of the professionalism and determination of these colleagues, who face a wide range of gender-based or racist remarks every day, but who do not lower their arms.
One of the most disappointing things in the current policy is the normalization of various forms of abuse.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn stated that the Labour Party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer this great community and that the party is restricted in the face of defiance motions and changes in the selection rules.
I've been given a lot of advice over the past two years: lowering my eyes, not expressing my ideas so loud, and everything would be fine.
But it is not for me to act as I do in politics.
I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy, because the neglect of the Thatcher government had caused the collapse of my classroom. Since then, I have wanted to work for better public services for those who need it most, whether it be as a local advisor or government minister.
I have never hidden my political ambitions, even in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East was disturbed by my political positions and my disputes with the current party leaders.
All I would like to say to those who have defended the motion Friday is that the country goes to a Brexit that will affect the homes, businesses and public services. I think this is not really the time to waste time and energy by debating my loyalty to the party's leader.
My only message is not for Nottingham Momentum, it is for my voters, whether they are workers or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of withdrawal or opportunism will prevent me from acting for the causes I defend, which are your interests to all.
Chris Leslie is a Member of Parliament for the electoral district of Nottingham East.
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose : Ayr remains invincuous
Two late trials may have failed the final result, but there is no doubt about it: Ayr deserved this triumph following the intense day match of the rugby Scottish Championship at XV.
The team is now at the top of the ranking and becomes the only team to win the championship.
In the end, it is the superiority of their defence and the way they seize the opportunities that allowed them to open the score. Coach Peter Murchie can congratulate himself on this game.
"So far, we have been tested, but we are invincible, so I must be happy!" he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose congratulated Ayr: "Good to them, they have been more effective than us and have grasped the opportunities."
Grant Anderson's 14th minute trial, transformed by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in a good position, but a yellow cardboard for Scottish squad Rory Hughes, released for the match by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to make the numbers speak. Jason Baggot took up an unprocessed test.
Climo aggravated the situation for Ayr with a penalty, before, just in mid-time. He marked and transformed a solo test to raise the score to 17-5 for Ayr at break.
Melrose started well the second half-time and Patrick Anderson's trial, transformed by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
It followed a long wait due to a serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, who left the ground on a cider. On the return, Ayr resumed the fronts with a Stafford McDowall test transformed by Climo.
Blair Macpherson, Ayr's Acting Captain, then received a yellow card and, again, Melrose tried his luck with an unprocessed test by Bruce Colvine, who created a palpable tension.
But the home team came back in hand and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for cutting Climo while he did not have the ball, from the touch of the penalty, MacPherson hit the back of Ayr's bat, which was progressing.
Climo transformed the trial, as almost every time since the recovery, after Kyle Rowe gathered David Armstrong's box kick and sent Gregor Henry's wingman away for the fifth home team test.
The Star of Still Game launches in the restoration
Ford Kieran, the star of Still Game, decided to make a career in the restaurant. The comedian was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old man incarnates Jack Jarvis in the famous BBC show, which he writes and coanies with his long-standing partner on stage, Greg Hemphilll.
The duo announced that the ninth series that arrives will be the end of the show. And Kiernan seems to be preparing for the post-Craiglang.
According to the official records, he is director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this story, although a source from the Scottish Sun revealed that Kiernan wanted to become involved in the "flowering environment of restoration" in Glasgow.
"The Sea Is Ours": Bolivia, blocked, hopes that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
Sailors patrol in an armored boat in the La Paz naval headquarters.
Public buildings have a blue flag like the ocean.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the naval bases display the following bike: "The sea returns to us right.
Recovery is a duty."
Throughout the blocked Bolivia, the memory of a lost coast for the benefit of Chile during a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is always well present. Just like the desire to sail on the Pacific Ocean, once again.
These hopes have not been so apparent for decades, and Bolivia is awaiting a decision by the International Court of Justice, which will be handed down on 1 October, after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the will, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course awaits a positive result," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the decision of the International Court of Justice on a large-screen basis throughout the country, hoping that the Hague Court will take a decision in favour of the Bolivian demand. Bolivia wishes that, after decades of sporadic negotiations, Chile should be required to negotiate the agreement of a sovereign passage into the ocean to Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia (who faces a controversial fight for re-election next year), also has much to say about the decision to be made on Monday.
"We are so close to being able to return to the Pacific Ocean," he said at the end of August.
But some analysts think that there is little chance that the court will vote for Chile, and that few things would change, even in the event of a positive decision.
The Netherlands-based United Nations instance does not have the power to grant a Chilean territory, and stated that it would not determine the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice makes its decision six months after the last arguments shows that the case "was not complicated," explains Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, the last four years may even have harmed him.
"The problem of access to the sea has been diverted by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morales' belligerent rhetoric has escaped all the remaining Chilean good will, she has suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to exchange, but after that, it will be very complicated to organize talks.
The last exchange of ambassadors between the two countries took place in 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representing Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the Court's decision-making was abnormally rapid.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also challenged the fact that Morales, which remains to date one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, used the maritime problem as a political beck.
"Bolivia will never abandon its right of access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The Court's decision is an opportunity to see that we must get rid of the past."
North Korea affirms that nuclear disarmament will take place only when it can trust the United States
Ri Yong Ho, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea, said that his country would not defend itself from its nuclear weapons until he had confidence in Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday in the United Nations General Assembly.
He asked the United States to respect the promises made at a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
He spoke at a time when the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to be on the verge of relaunching a nuclear diplomacy in the impasse more than three months after the Singapore Summit with Kim Jong Un, current North Korea leader.
Ri declares that it is "chemerical" to think that the United States' continued sanctions and opposition to a statement that will put an end to the Korean war will fold the North.
Washington is reluctant to accept the declaration in the absence of significant prior disarmament measures by Pyongyang.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But Pyongyang's seriousness regarding the abandonment of an arsenal that the country considers as the sole guarantee of its security is a debate.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month in order to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Parisian fashion parades reveal the latest trends in head cover, perhaps soon available in your shops
If you want to add XXL parts to your hat collection or protect from 100% sun, don't look any more.
The creators Valentino and Thom Browne presented their collections of delirious oversized hats at a PE19 show that honored the style of the Fashion Week in Paris.
All hats extravagant each other invaded Instagram this summer, and the creators decided to integrate their delightful pieces into the parades.
Valentino's light piece was a beige eccentric hat adorned with a wide edge that evoked a feather, which encompassed the heads of the mannequins.
The other oversized accessories included jewelry-based pastries, a sorcer hat and even a pineapple. But these pieces were not designed to keep you warm.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of original masks. Just in time for Halloween.
Most of the masks had their lips sewn and evoked more Hannibal Lecter than the Haute-Couture.
One creation resembled a dive equipment, with tuba and glasses, while another was thinking of a melted ice cone.
And if you follow fashion trends, then you're lucky.
According to style observers, imposing hats could come to your shopping streets.
The XXL hats follow the saddle of the "Bomba", the broad straw hat that the stars pull off, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that sells this hardly portable hat that flooded social networks presented another of its flagship creations on the podium: a beach bag in straw almost as large as the mannequin in a bathing shirt that wore it.
The burnt orange bag, decorated with raffia fringes and a handle of white leather, was the masterpiece of the PE19 exhibition The Jacquemus Riviera during the Paris Fashion Week.
The stylist of celebrities Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see the great beach hats and bags arrive in the shops for the next summer. The creator has so marked the spirits that it is obvious that there will be demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential to the citizens of the world
The independent schools of Scotland maintain a record of excellence in school. This trend continued in 2018 with new excellent exam results enhanced by a collective and individual success in sports, art, music and other community activities.
With over 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (CIS) are striving to provide the best level of service to students and their parents.
Independent schools work to prepare their students for higher education, careers they have chosen, and their place as citizens of the world.
As a sector of education in a position to design and implement a tailor-made school programme, we see that contemporary languages remain popular and desired in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you speak to his head.
If you speak to him in his language, you speak to his heart."
This reminds us that we cannot rely on English to create relationships and establish a relationship of trust with people from other countries.
Looking at the excellent results at the exams this year, we see that the languages are at the top of the ranking, with the most important success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68% of students studying foreign languages obtained the highest score, A.
The data collected from the 74 SCIS schools show that 72% of the students obtained the highest grade, A, in Mandarin, as well as the 72% of students who studied German, 69% of students who studied French and 63% of students who studied Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as absolutely essential skills for children and young people in the future.
Now languages as subjects are organized as well as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in the programs of independent schools and other schools.
A survey by the British Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 revealed that among the difficulties faced by employers in recruiting candidates, 17% were linked to insufficient language skills.
Language skills are therefore increasingly vital in preparing young people for their future careers.
With more jobs in need of languages, these skills are essential in our globalised world.
Regardless of their choice of career, a person who speaks a second language will benefit from a real advantage in the future through this sustainable skill.
Being able to communicate directly with foreigners will automatically place the multilingual person in front of its competitors.
According to a survey by YouGov in 2013 of 4,000 adults living in the United Kingdom, 75% of them did not master a foreign language enough to hold a conversation. French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage (15%).
This is why investing in language learning is important for children today.
Speaking several languages, including those of emerging economies, children will be given a better chance of finding rewarding employment.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Several of them will focus on classical contemporary languages, while others will teach languages considered important for the United Kingdom in the perspective of 2020, including Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's preferences, several languages will be available in independent schools, with a specialist staff in the field.
Scottish independent schools want to offer a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills necessary for their success, no matter what their future reserves.
It is clear that at present, in a global trading environment, languages remain of paramount importance for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages must be regarded as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, this diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
We have to do this.
John Edward is director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will make his debut with the Lakers Saturday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans looking at the beginnings of LeBron James at Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, the Lakers' coach, announced that James would play Sunday, in the open season, against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But we still don't know how many minutes he'll play.
"More than one, less than 48," Walton said on the official Lakers website.
The Lakers' reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably play for a few minutes.
After training, earlier in the week, James was asked for his plans for the pre-season program, which includes six games.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need pre-season games to be ready."
Trump Campaigns in West Virginia ( YouTube Channel)
President Donald Trump starts a series of campaign meetings this evening in Wheeling, Virginia-Western.
Other stopovers, notably in states such as Tennessee and Mississippi where the president is popular, are planned.
As the vote for confirmation of the vacancy to the Supreme Court was postponed, Trump sought support for the mid-term elections to come and prevented the Republicans from losing control of Congress during the vote in November.
What time is Trump's meeting in West Virginia tonight and how to watch it online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, Virginia West, is scheduled for 19:00 (East Time) tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow it online below, live on YouTube.
Trump should address the question of the hearings of the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, accused of sexual assault, who took place this week. Kavanaugh's confirmation vote in the Senate should be postponed to a week during the FBI's investigation.
But this series of meetings is mainly aimed at helping Republicans gain ground for the November elections.
According to Reuters, the North American President stated in his campaign that the five meetings were aimed at “encouraging volunteers and supporters while Republicans are trying to protect and extend the majority they hold in the Senate and in the House of Representatives”.
"Congress control is such an essential part of its program that the President will make himself in the greatest number of States possible at the beginning of this campaign of election in charge," said Reuters, a spokesperson for the Trump team, who refused to be appointed.
According to West Virginia Metro News, tonight's meeting, scheduled at the Wheeling Wesbank Arena, could bring together supporters from "Oyio and Pennsylvania, and draw attention to Pittsburgh media".
On Saturday, it will be the second trip to Trump in a month in West Virginia, a state he won in 2016 by over 40 percentage points.
Trump tries to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate in the Senate of West Virginia, who is on the prowl in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to try to revive him in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team is ready to fight to keep hope in the approach of Sunday's simples
After three simple, Saturday afternoon forsoms could well represent what was missing to this Ryder Cup.
The movement of swing swing is an invented sport concept of all pieces but to which players sincerely believe, and more than ever during tournaments such as this one.
So where would they find the momentum now?
"They were driving with six points ahead and now four, so it gives us some wings," Jordan Spieth said while he was leaving for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, with four points ahead and twelve others to play.
The Americans, according to Spieth, have a feeling of having a bit of the wind in the stern and have every reason to be encouraged, especially by Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and can tarnish themselves by getting every three out of four points.
Spieth has been extremely effective from tea to green and provides an example.
The vigorous shouts of joy intensified as his game progressed. A crucial putt allowed him to equalize the fourth part while Thomas and he was led down two after two holes.
His putt, through which they won the game in the 15th hole, sparked a similar scream from those who tell you that he believes the American team still in law.
"We really need to stay determined and focus on his game," Spieth said.
That's all that's left for each of these players now.
18 holes to stand out.
The only players to have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, as the history of Ryder Cup attests.
The strange but adorable European pair won four out of four matches and is not entitled to error.
Not only were "Moliwood" the only ones not to realize a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also escaped there Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and during the last nine holes Friday morning.
This series, the way their energy seems to circulate between them and the crowd deliriously designate them as players to beat Sundays, and there is no player more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari to whom a potential European victory is enjoyed while the sun lies on the National Golf.
Preferably, both at the same time with different holes.
But talking about European glory remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly beat Sergio Garcia, hero of the morning fourballs, while he was teaming with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first nine shots sent the Spanish and the Swedish to a hole they could never get out of.
On the other hand, Sunday nobody's here to help you.
The fourballs and forsoms are so fascinating to observe closely because of the interactions between the pairs, the advice they give and the advice they don't give, and how a strategy can tip into an eye.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has made considerable progress during the last day, but this forsomo session has also proved that Americans have the courage to fight, which some doubt, especially in the country.
Europe leads 10-6 on the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe will benefit from a strong advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after having won it 10-6 on the United States during the Saturday ovens and ovens.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two victories on a desperate Tiger Woods, which enabled them to score four points so far.
Well decided to keep the title she lost in Hazeltine two years ago, Thomas Bjorn's European team made a difference by imposing 3-1 on the morning fourballs in front of a disordered American team.
The United States has shown greater resistance in the forms and won two victories, but they have failed to resolve the gap.
Jim Furyk's men need to pick up eight points on Sunday 12 during the simple ones to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European recruit to pick up four points, while Molinari and him, named "Melliwood" after a failing weekend, are only the second pair of Ryder Cup's history to get four points in their first four matches.
After having crushed Woods and Patrick Reed during the four-balls, they beat the pair composed by American beginner Bryson Dechambeau and a Woods already tired by a 5 and an even more categorical one.
Woods, who dragged during the two matches on Saturday, shined a few times, but now he lost 19 of his matches in fourballs and forsoms, and seven of them.
Justin Rose, well rested for the morning fourballs, teamed up with Henrik Stenson in the forsoms, winning 2 to 1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, respectively numbers one and three in the world ranking.
Europe was not spared during the tournament that took place in southwestern Paris, in a fresh but clear time.
The triple winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas made the reference for the Americans by marking two points on Saturday.
They won a well-deserved 2-1 win against the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls and again beat Poulter and Rory McIllroy 4-3 in the forsoms, they lost the first two holes.
Twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, a team recovered from a four-point gap in simple, although Furyk's team, which held the crown, had only to play null to keep its trophy.
After being seconded for two days, however, they might not give up a Sunday counter-attack.
North Korea states that disarmament will in no case be unilaterally untrustworthy.
On Saturday, the North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs told the United Nations that maintaining sanctions strengthened his distrust of the United States and that it would be impossible for his country to unilaterally renounce its nuclear weapons under these circumstances.
At the Annual General Assembly of the World Organization, Ri Yong Ho stated that North Korea had taken "significant measures of goodwill" last year, such as ending nuclear and missile testing, dismantling of the nuclear testing site and its commitment not to have nuclear weapons and technology proliferated.
"But we do not see any corresponding response from the United States," he regretted.
In the absence of confidence in the United States, we will fear for our national security and, in such circumstances, it is excluded that we be the first to disarm unilaterally."
While reiterating North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's opposition to a "step-by-step" approach to nuclearization, by which North Korea would be rewarded if it had gradually taken action, its statement was important in that it did not reject the idea of unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, made on 12 June in Singapore at the very first summit between an American President-in-Office and a North Korean leader, when Kim pledged to work in favour of a "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised to guarantee the security of North Korea.
North Korea is seeking to officially put an end to the Korean War (1950-1953), but the United States said that Pyongyang must first renounce its nuclear weapons.
Washington also refused requests to alleviate severe international sanctions against North Korea.
the United States insist that North Korea first engage in denuclearization and increase pressure by imposing sanctions to achieve its objective in a coercive manner, even opposing the "end-of-war declaration".
“Those who think that these sanctions can make us rain do not know us.
The problem is that maintaining sanctions increases our mistrust."
Ri made no comment on the second summit between Kim and Trump raised before the United Nations by the American leader earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister pointed out three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, and added: "If the part concerned with the issue of denuclearization was South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be in such an impasse."
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was radically different from that of last year, when he declared before the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable to point North Korean missiles on North American territory after President Trump called Kim "missile man" on a suicide mission.
Trump, who had threatened the United Nations last year to "completely destroy" North Korea, did not praise Kim this year for the courage with which he applied disarmament measures, but added that much remained to be done and that sanctions would not be lifted until North Korea disarmed.
Wednesday, Trump said that no deadline had been set."This may take two years, three years or five months; it has no importance," he said.
China and Russia argue that the United Nations Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures adopted.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared last Thursday to the United Nations Security Council that "The application of Security Council sanctions must be firmly and systematically maintained until total, final and verified denuclearization."
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to enhance the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri on the margins of the United Nations General Assembly and then announced that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
This year, Pompeo has already made three trips to North Korea, but his last trip was somewhat disastrous.
In July, he left Pyongyang claiming that progress had been made but, in the hours that followed, North Korea denounced his "gangster methods".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea undertook to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States took "equivalent measures".
According to South Korean President Kim calls for Trump's security assurances in Singapore, and for efforts to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard: Students taking rest courses
This year, Harvard University has set up a new course that allows all first-cycle students to sleep more and fight against the growing maleist tendency to study by consuming caffeine all night.
A teacher noticed that most students at the world's best university are unable to take care of them
This course, designed by Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is the first in the United States.
It's after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning that the idea came to him
At the end of the day, a student approached me and said, "Why is this only said to me in the last year?"
She claimed that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
Dispensed for the first time this year, this course explains to students the need to adopt good sleep habits to improve their school and physical performance, as well as their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and general director of health services at the university, stated that the university had decided to introduce the course after finding that the students had a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The class time consists of different interactive exercises.
One of the sections presents the image of a dormitory containing different objects (coffee cups, curtains, baskets, books...) on which students click to know the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on their physical benefits and the importance of integrating a routine before bedtime.
In another section, participants learn how lack of long-term sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons then invites participants to reflect on their daily routine.
"We know that this will not instantly alter the behaviour of students.
However, we believe they have the right to know this information - in the same way as you have the right to know what the effects of smoking on health," added Professor Czeisler.
According to him, the culture of pride of " having a white night" still exists, and he adds that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students make a growing problem of sleep.
Having sufficient sleep and good quality should be the "secret weapon" of students to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to avoid weighting, because the lack of sleep puts the brain in an innition mode, making them hungry permanently.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student in chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to design this course after being one of his students last year, during his first year at Harvard.
He claimed that this course had opened his eyes to him and moved him to insist that he should be offered to the whole campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to propose to all third-cycle students to follow a similar curriculum before joining the recognized institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students provide an alarm for both bedtime and waking hours, and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED light, which may disturb their circadian rhythm and cause sleep disturbances.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga's goal brings Gerrard's men down
The Rangers were hit again hard outside, Dolly Menga's attack leading Steven Gerrard's disarticulated team in Livingston to a 1-0 defeat.
Ibrox's team was hoping to record his first victory in travel since his 4-1 triumph in February in St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted on Gerrard his second defeat in 18 matches as a coach, leaving his team on the drift, eight points behind the Hearts, drivers of the Ladbroke Premiership.
Menga hit seven minutes before the mid-time and the Rangers team, short of inspiration, failed to equalize.
As the Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston rises in third position, just behind Hibernian on the difference of goals.
And other difficulties could make themselves felt for the Rangers, the referee Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury following the jet of an object from the opposite side.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which swept Ayr into the semifinal of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, for his part, chose the same Livi 11 who pulled a point at the Hearts last week and would have been delighted to see that his well-trained team was smothering its opponents on each turn.
The Rangers may have mastered the possession of the balloon, but Livingston did more.
They should have scored in two minutes, when Menga's first shot sent Scott Pittman on Allan McGregor's goal, but the middle of the ground let him pass his chance.
Keaghan Jacobs then shot a mighty blow to Captain Craig Halkett, but his teammate defender Alan Lithgow was able to reach the second pole.
The Rangers managed to take control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly believed that he should have received a penalty after the frank beating when Steven Lawless and collided with him, but referee Steven Thomson ruled out the Colombian's requests.
The Rangers only took advantage of two shots in the first period, but the former Ibrox guard, Liam Kelly, was barely disturbed by Lassana Coulibaly and a strike by Ovie Ejaria.
If the opening of the score by Livi at 34 minutes went against the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it by their hard work.
Once again, the Rangers failed in the face of Jacobs' arrest.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher gave the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool blood to choose Menga for a simple end.
Gerrard reacted in mid-time by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and the exchange failed to have an immediate impact when the wing appeared before Morelos, but the impressive Kelly rushed to block.
Livingston has also continued to push visitors to play exactly the type of game they like, with Lithgow and Halfett shooting long bullets on long balls.
Holt's team could have taken the lead in the last few moments, but McGregor managed well to pull Jacobs back before Lithgow passed by the goal.
The Rangers' replacement, Glenn Middleton, once again demanded a penalty at the end of the game while he was on his way with Jacobs, but Thomson again ignored him.
Almanach: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page from our Almanach "Sunday Morning": On September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and THE TOURNE ACCOUNT... was born the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity; an invention that subsequently gave birth to the device known as Geiger counter.
Since then, the Geiger counter has also become fundamental in pop culture, as can be seen in the 1950 Bells of Coronado film, with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, two unlikely scientists:
A man: "What is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, it's used to look for radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
Thanks to these hearing aids, the effects of atoms released in minerals can really be heard by radioactivity."
Evans: "So tell me, it sure as hell jumps in there!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that bears his name remains.
A new cancer vaccine allows the immune system to "detect" cancer cells
A new cancer vaccine allows the immune system to "detect" cancer cells and kill them
As part of treatment, the vaccine indicates to the immune system how to recognize cancer cells
This technique consists of extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them into a laboratory.
They can then "detect" a protein that is common to many cancers, and are then reinjected
An experimental vaccine shows encouraging results in patients with different types of cancer.
One woman who received the vaccine, whose goal is to learn from the immune system to recognize cancer cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method is to extract immune cells from a patient and modify them into a laboratory, so that they can detect HER2 protein, common to many cancers, and finally reinject them.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Cancer Institute based in Bethesda, Maryland said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
According to Professor Berzofsky, HER2 protein "causes an increase in several types of cancer", including breast cancer, ovarian, pulmonary and colorectal.
A similar approach, involving the removal of immune cells to "learn" them to target cancer cells, has done its evidence in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
With a MAGA helmet, Kanye West launched into a Pro-Trump Diatribe after its transfer to the SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was horrified on the stage after a slow performance during which he praised US President Donald Trump on a Saturday Night Live and announced that he was going to run for the election in 2020.
After his third song, Ghost Town, who sang with a 'Make America Great Again' jacket, West joined the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"Many times, I talk to white people and they say, "How can you like Trump? He's racist!"
"Well, if racism worried me, I would have left America for a long time," he said.
The SNL show started with a sketch by Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocks Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's judicial committee on allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it has not been broadcast, the recording of the West Diatribe was relayed on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
We don't know if Rock meant to mock West with this publication.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had spent a bad quarter of an hour behind the scenes because of his helmet.
"They put pressure on me.
They told me not to come with that cap on my head.
They put pressure on me!
And after they say that I'm in a rush," he says, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see him, the fool?" and claimed he would wear his superman head, because no one can dictate his actions to him. Do you want the world to progress?
Try love."
His comments attracted him at least twice as much noise from the public, and the members of the SNL seemed embarrassed, Variety reports. One person on site told the magazine: "A silence of death fell on the whole board."
West had been called to replace at the last minute the singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, the rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West disarrayed a lot of people by singing song I Love it in a Perrier bottle costume.
West received the support of the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who published the following tweet: "To one of the most courageous minds: MERCISE TO FULE TEND."
But Karen Hunter, the host of the show, tweeted that West was simply "loyal to himself, and it's absolutely wonderful."
"However, I choose not to reward someone (buying his music, clothing or supporting his art) who, in my view, adopts and reverses a harmful ideology for my community.
He's free.
And so have we," she added.
Prior to the program, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and claimed that he was now "officially known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows the tracks of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper Snoop Dogg named Snoop Lion and of course the legendary Prince fire, which changed his name to symbol, then that of the artist previously known as Prince.
Belfast: Indictment of attempted murder after a white gun attack in a restaurant
A 45-year-old man is accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed last Friday in a restaurant east of Belfast.
According to the police, the incident occurred in Ballyhacklove.
The accused should appear on Monday in the Belfast Court of First Instance.
The prosecution heads will be examined by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Kit Harington, the star of the Game of Thrones series, takes on the toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his fine blade role, Jon Snow in Game of Thrones, HBO's violent fantastic medieval series.
But the 31-year-old actor took on the stereotype of the male hero, asserting that this type of role on the screen often brings young boys to go for hard cooking to get respected.
In an interview given to the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that "something is wrong" and addresses the question of toxic masculinity at the time of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married Rose Leslie, a covedette of Game of Thrones, who was also 31 years old, confessed that he was "firmly" to address this issue.
"Personally, I think deeply that we have damaged masculinity."
"What lessons have we taught to young men who become adults in relation to the problem that now arises?"
According to Kit, television could be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its very male characters.
He continued: "What behavior is born, what behavior has been instilled?
What does television and street teach young boys to think that they should behave like that to be a man?
I believe that this is really one of the fundamental issues of our time - how can we change that?
There's obviously something going on."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not prologues or follow-up when the series will end next summer, claiming to have finished with "the battlefields and horses".
As of November, Kit will be the star of a recovery of True West by Sam Shepard, who tells the story of a film producer and his brother, a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that the meeting with his wife Rose was for him the best thing that happened to him in Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this series, so she offered me my future family and my life now," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the character lover of Kit, Jon Snow, in the fantastic series that won an Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 in Scotland, in Leslie's family domain.
HIV / AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14 per cent increase in its population with HIV and AIDS.
According to the Chinese health authorities, more than 820,000 people are involved.
Nearly 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the patients have been contaminated during sexual intercourse, which is a new fact.
Historically, the virus spread rapidly in some parts of the country following transfusions of contaminated blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to nearly zero, asserting Chinese health authorities at a conference held in Yunnan Province.
However, from year to year, the number of HIV-positive and AIDS-affected people in China has increased by 100,000.
In the Chinese LGBT community, transmission of HIV through sex is a serious problem.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community remains widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70% to 90% of homosexual men end up marrying a woman.
Many cases of transmission are due to inadequate sexual protection.
As part of its efforts to address this problem, since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV drugs.
Maxine Waters denies that a GOP employee has disclosed Senators' data and denounces "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories".
On Saturday, U.S. Republican Maxine Waters denounced allegations that a member of her team would have published personal information about three Republican senators on Wikipedia's legislators pages.
Los Angeles Democrat stated that these statements were supported by experts and "extreme right" websites.
"Taxes, lies, and yet lies" responded to Waters in a statement on Twitter.
It would seem that the information disclosed included the addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. senators. Lindsey Graham, from South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was posted on Thursday by an unknown in Capitol Hill during the Senate session on allegations of sexual assault against the candidate Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court.
The flight occurred some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
According to Hill, conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState indicated that the IP address identifying the source of the messages was associated with the Waters office and disclosed information from a Waters staff member.
According to Waters, "this unfounded allegation is completely false and an absolute lie."
"The member of my team, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised because of these fraudulent and false allegations, is in no case responsible for the leaking of this information."
"This fallacious allegation is completely false and a real lie."
Waters' statement quickly sparked online criticism, including from Ari Fleischer, the former White House press officer.
"This denial is anger," he wrote.
"This indicates that it does not have the temperament needed to be a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, he must not be angry.
It must not be provocative.
It must not question the motives of the accused.
She must remain calm and serene."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, accused of appearing too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate at Waters headquarters during mid-term elections, also reported his thoughts on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's huge," he wrote on Twitter.
In his statement, Waters stated that his office had alerted "the authorities and services responsible for the enforcement of the laws concerned" about these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed," she added, "and that they are held responsible for all their destructive and dangerous acts for all members of my team."
Johnny English still hit. Parody of Rowan Atkinson, underdue spy
It has now become a tradition of looking for the scope of Brexit in any new British film and it seems to apply to this resumption of the Johnny English action comedy, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and resurfaced in 2011 with Johnny English, the return.
Will the ironic self-satisfy on the question of the evidence of our insignificance represent our country's new chance of exportation?
In any case, Johnny English, incompetent, with his eyes peeled and his face in rubber, has seen his licence renewed for the second time in a confused context - this name indicating above all that it is a great comic creation designed for a non-English cinematic audience.
Of course, he is the stupid secret agent who, despite his dubious attempts of glamorous charm, has a little Clouseau, a suspicion of Mr Bean and a good dose of the guy who performs a small note in Les Chariots de Fire at the 2012 opening ceremony of the London Olympic Games.
Originally, he was also inspired by the traveler and man of international mystery that Atkinson once played in Barclaycard television advertising, now forgotten, leaving chaos behind him.
The last Johnny English has a nice one or two moments.
I liked Johnny English as he approached a helicopter as he wore a medieval armor and the rotor blades briefly struck his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is enhanced, although humor is rather insufficient and strangely superfluous, especially when "serious" licenses such as 007 and Mission impossible make up themselves in confidence with comedy.
The mood seems more oriented towards children than towards adults and, for me, Johnny English's far-fated mesaventures are less creative and less targeted than Atkinson' silent movie gags in the character of Bean.
The perpetually topical premise is that Britain has serious problems.
A computer pirate infiltrated the super-secret web network of British spies, revealing the identity of all British agents on the ground, to the great disarray of agents in service - a low-level role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the drop that makes the vase overflow for a prime minister who is a pompous character on the edge of the crisis and who already suffers from political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of herself with this quasi-Teresa-May character, but there is not much to put under the tooth in the scenario.
His intelligence advisors inform him that every active spy has been compromised, he will have to get someone out of his retirement.
This means that it is necessary to bother Johnny English himself, who is now employed in a chic institution as a school teacher, but who secretly gives lessons on how to become a secret agent: a few beautiful facets here, because English proposes a espionage academy like Rock Academy.
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and finds Bough, his former long-season partner, once again camped by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, attached to a submarine commander, a funny hockey stick in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So, Batman and Robin, who create great trouble for Her Majesty's secret services, go back to action and meet Olga Kurylenko, the beautiful fatal woman Ofelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister falls dangerously under the occupation of the billionaire tech charismatic, which says he can solve the computer problems of Britain: the sinister Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough throw their odyssée of odyssey jokes: under the disguise of servers, they set fire to a sparkling French restaurant; they create a chaos by flaunting on Volta's luxurious sailboat; and English triggers a true anarchy when he tries, with a helmet of virtual reality, to get acquainted with the interior of Volta's house.
All the arrests are insured for this last sequence, but nevertheless there is nothing wrong with the children in all of this.
A rather moderate film.
I couldn't help but think, as for Johnny English's other films: can't the British film industry offer Rowan Atkinson a role that will really value his talent?
The Labour Party denies having developed a plan to allow the British to work four days but to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party must consider a radical plan that will allow the British to work four days a week - but to be paid for five.
Apparently, the party wants business leaders to benefit workers from the savings generated by artificial intelligence (IA) by giving them an additional day of leave.
This would allow employees to take advantage of a three-day weekend, while continuing to pay the same wage.
According to some sources, the idea would agree with the Party's economic agenda and plans to guide the country in favour of workers.
The four-day shift was approved by the union congress as a means for workers to benefit from economic change.
An important source within the Labour Party said in Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year."
"This will not happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is a goal that goes hand in hand with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy for workers as well as with its overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party was committed to a four-day workweek during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration is currently not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A spokesperson for the Labour Party stated: "A four-day working week is not a party policy and is not considered by the Party."
Deputy Chancellor John McDonnell took advantage of last week's working conference to provide details on his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell stated that he was determined to take over the power of "anonymous administrators" and "profitrs" in public utility companies.
The plans of the alternate chancellor also provide that current shareholders of water companies may not recover the full amount of their implementation, as the Labour Government may make "deductions" due to alleged deviations of conduct.
It has also confirmed its plan to integrate workers into business boards and the creation of a fund of inclusive shareholders that will pay 10% of private business capital to employees, which will charge up to £500 per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy entrust to "60 Minutes" if the FBI's investigation on Kavanaugh could make them change their mind.
The final vote on the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court was postponed by at least one week following the FBI's investigation of charges against him and raised the question of whether the Bureau's findings could encourage Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In a Sunday interview, Scott Pelley, the correspondent for the "60 Minutes" program, asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find out anything that would lead them to change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
“ Of course, ” says Kennedy.
"When I went to the hearing, I said that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, when these allegations were made, and I asked him, "Did you do that?"
He was determined, determined, unequivocal."
However, Graham's vote appears to be engraved on the stone.
"I made my decision on Brett Kavanaugh and there would be an explosive charge," he said.
"Dr Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett categorically denied it," Graham said, alluding to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And the people she names couldn't verify it.
It's a 36-year-old affair.
I see nothing new that changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event with a very impressive star palm tree and an equally impressive mission: to end poverty in the world.
The Global Citizen Festival, now in its seventh edition, will see tens of thousands of people coming to the Great Lawn of Central Park in order not only to benefit from the performance of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise public awareness of the festival's true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, the first edition of which took place in 2012, is a Global Poverty Project extension, an international defence group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you are ready to pay for a VIP ticket), spectators had to perform a series of tasks, or "actions", such as volunteering, send an email to a world leader, telephone or make any other useful effort to raise public awareness about poverty.
But to what extent can the Global Citizen organization still achieve its goal in the remaining 12 years?
Does the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really allow them to persuade them to demand an action call, or is it just another example of "clickivism" - a situation where people really think to make a difference by signing a petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million "actions" by its supporters, who advocate for many different goals.
According to the organization, these actions have helped to encourage global leaders to make commitments and adopt policies of over $37 billion that are expected to change lives by more than $2.25 billion by 2030.
In early 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, including a portion of at least $10 billion already paid or lifted.
The Group believes that the guaranteed funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a British partnership of investors and executives who have committed themselves to "help children to develop their full potential", while promising Rwanda to provide £35 million in aid to stop malnutrition in this country after receiving more than 4,700 Global Citizens messages.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," said the Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of the The Power of Nutrition program at a concert held in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that, following over 5,000 actions to call on the United Kingdom to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will benefit 5 million women and children through nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on its website, "what makes you think it is possible to end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen said: "The way to get there will be long and difficult, sometimes we will fall and fail.
However, like the great movements of civil rights and the struggle against apartheid before us, we will succeed, because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists that will take place this year in New York, where Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will love the show.
The United States could use the Navy to create a "block" to hinder Russian energy exports - Interior Secretary
In order to prevent Russian energy from coming to markets, including in the Middle East, Washington can "if necessary" appeal to the US Navy, Ryan Zinke, the US Interior Secretary, quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke said that Russia's presence in Syria - particularly where it operates at the request of the legitimate government - is a pretext that allows it to explore new energy markets.
"I believe they are in the Middle East in order to negotiate energy as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern centre of Europe," he said.
According to the official representative, there are ways to remedy it.
"The United States can, with our Navy, ensure that the sea lanes are open and, if necessary, obstruct to ensure that their energy is not put on the market," he added.
Zinke addressed participants at the Energy Alliance Consumer event, a non-profit organization that defines itself as the "energy consumer spokesman" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, stressing that they are actually the same.
"As far as Iran and Russia are concerned, the economic option is more or less in the exploitation and replacement of fuels," he said, while referring to Russia, saying that it has "more than one cord in its arc" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration committed itself to revitalizing the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe by replacing Russia as a much cheaper solution for European consumers.
In order to do so, the representatives of the Trump administration, including the US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to exit the "inappropriate" project of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which, according to Trump, renders the city of Berlin "prisoner" of Moscow.
On several occasions, Moscow stressed that the value of the North Stream 2 pipeline worth $11 billion, which is expected to double the current capacity to reach 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's fervent opposition to the project is merely motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
In a speech delivered in September in Moscow following a meeting with Rick Perry, the US Energy Secretary, Russian Energy Minister Alexandre Novak said "I believe we share this view that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers."
The position of the United States gave rise to negative reactions from Germany, which reaffirmed its involvement in this project.
The main German industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the United States not to become involved in European energy policy or bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a huge problem when a third country interferes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, the director of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) following a recent meeting between German chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian president Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider presenting himself at the 2020 presidential elections, says Senator of Massachusetts
The Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would seriously consider presenting herself to the presidential elections following the mid-term elections.
During a public assembly in Holyoke, in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was thinking of presenting himself.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and for that, a woman must be at the top," says The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will seriously consider presenting my candidacy to the Presidents."
Warren said what she thought of President Donald Trump at the public meeting, claiming that he "led this country in the wrong direction."
"I am very worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was frank in his criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
Friday, in a Twitter message, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, a survey published Thursday showed that the majority of Warren's voters are not of the opinion that it should be presented by 2020.
According to a survey by the Political Research Centre of the University of Suffolk and Boston Globe, 58% of Massachusetts' "probable" voters claimed that the senator was not supposed to show up.
32% were in favour of such a campaign.
The survey revealed that former Governor Deval Patrick was more supportive, with 38% in favour of a potential campaign and 48% against it.
Other highly sought-after democrats' names for a potential campaign in 2020 include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin evokes Track Palin's PTSD during Donald Trump's gathering
26-year-old Track Palin spent a year in Iraq after his recruitment in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged in an incident of domestic violence.
"What my own son is currently experiencing, what he feels as he comes home, I can link him to other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and certain injuries with which our soldiers come back," she told the public at the gathering for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described his arrest as a taboo subject and said about his son and other veterans that "they come back a little different, hardened, wondering if we respect what their friends and members of the air force and each other have given to the country."
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesperson for the Wasilla Police Service, he was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of assault and marital violence on a woman, which interferes with a relationship of marital violence and the possession of a weapon in a state of drunkenness.
18 States and the District of Columbia are in favour of a judicial challenge to the new asylum policy
18 States and the District of Columbia are in favour of a legal challenge to the new American policy that refuses asylum for victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
On Friday in Washington, representatives from the 18 States and the District filed a statement in favour of a asylum-seekers who challenged this policy, NBC News said.
The complainant's full name in Grace v. Sessions opened in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy were not disclosed.
She said that her partner "and her sons, members of violent gangs," had assaulted her, but the US authorities decided to reject her asylum application on 20 July.
She was detained in Texas.
State prosecutors supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generated a large number of asylum applications in the United States, such as countries facing widespread gang and domestic violence problems.
The new U.S. asylum policy annulled a decision made in 2014 by the Board of Appeal of Immigrants, which authorized illegal immigrants fleeing marital violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, District Attorney General of Columbia, said Friday in a statement that the new policy "is unaware of the decades of state, federal and international law."
"The Federal Act stipulates that all asylum applications must be examined on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances of the application, and such a prohibition violates this principle," stated the friendly curiae.
The lawyers also argued in the memorandum that the policy of refusal of entry of immigrants harms the American economy, claiming that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and to "provide the necessary work".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing marital violence and gang violence in June.
" Asylum is granted to persons leaving their country of origin because of persecution or fear for reasons of race, belief, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political convictions," said Sessions on 11 June in its announcement of the said policy.
" Asylum has never been designed to alleviate all the problems -- even the most serious -- that people encounter every day around the world."
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu while the number of double deaths in the race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is increasingly dramatic.
"I feel very tense," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, comforting her fiévre boy in Palu, in an empty city evacuation center.
"At every moment, an ambulance brings the bodies back.
Clean water is rare."
Residents have been seen travelling to their destroyed homes, collecting destroyed property and trying to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by magnitude 7.5 earthquake were submerged.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who suffered from a fracture of the back and shoulders, rested in front of Palu's military hospital, where patients were treated outside due to strong persistent replicas.
The tears filled his eyes when he told how he had felt the violent earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I was crushed into the ruins of the wall, I believe," Haris told Associated Press, stating that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife call for help, but after silence.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of "intimidation" by means of "propagand ads"
A week after a Chinese official newspaper had a four-page commercial with the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China in an American newspaper, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump mentioned last Wednesday China Daily's supplement paid in Des Moines Register – the most sold newspaper in Iowa – after accusing China of trying to interfere in the 6 November US parliamentary elections, an accusation that China rejects.
By accusing Beijing of wanting to interfere in the U.S. elections, Trump noted what US officials told Reuters to be a new phase in a growing Washington campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently paralyzed in an increasing trade war that led them to apply reciprocal tariffs to their imports.
At the beginning of the commercial war, China's tariff measures aimed at hitting exporters of States such as Iowa who supported Trump's Republican Party, said Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former long-standing Governor of Iowa, a large exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, written by Branstad in an opinion article published in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, "is doubling its intimidation by publishing propaganda in our own free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American tradition of freedom of expression and freedom of the press by inserting a paid advertising in the Des Moines Register," Branstad writes.
"On the other hand, at the Beijing press office, you will find little disputing voice and you will not see the true reflection of the divergent views that Chinese people may have on the disturbing Chinese economic trajectory, because the media deeply obey the Communist Chinese party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most important newspapers has avoided publishing" his article, without saying what newspaper.
Analysts warn that Republicans are alienating voters to mid-term elections because of the collapse of Kavanaugh
While many high-ranking Republicans defended Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court in the context of allegations of sexual assault, analysts warned that a negative reaction, especially among women, could occur during the forthcoming mid-term elections.
The feelings surrounding this case have been extremely strong, and most Republicans have already publicly shown that they wanted the vote to take place.
In an article published on September 29th in The Hill, Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, stated "that we can't go back."
Reeher added that he doubted that the last minute's efforts by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) in favour of an FBI investigation are enough to calm the voters' anger.
According to Karine Jean-Pierre, Senior Adviser and National Speaker of the Progressive Group MoveOn, "women will not forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget it tomorrow, and not November," she said on September 28th according to the Washington newspaper.
On Friday morning, according to Mic, the protesters sang "The month of November is coming!" in the corridor of the Senate while Republicans governing the Judicial Committee chose to advance the appointment of Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be out of place," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst.
"People say it's already high, it's true.
But this could be even higher, especially among the electors of the suburban government and young voters from 18 to 29 years of age who, even if they don't like the president, often don't vote."
Even before Ford's public statement explaining in detail the allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court's name, analysts suggested that the reaction would be likely to be alive if Republicans moved the confirmation forward.
According to NBC News, former Chairman of the National Republican Committee, Michael Steele, said at the beginning of last week that "It became a mess for the GOP."
"It's not only about the vote of the committee or the final vote, nor about the appointment of Kavanaugh. It's also about how Republicans managed the situation and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of the United States Priorities, a group that helps elected democrats in the television newspaper.
Following the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, however, the Americans seem to be divided about the credibility of both parties, a small majority of them hanging on the side of the latter.
A new survey of YouGov revealed that 41% of the respondents believed absolutely or probably in Ford's testimony, while 35% said they believed absolutely or probably Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they believed that Kavanaugh had probably or absolutely lied during his testimony, while only 30% said the same thing about Ford.
According to The Guardian, the FBI investigates allegations made by Ford and at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, after Senator Flake's pressure.
Ford testified under oath last week before the Senate Judicial Committee that she had been assaulted by Kavanaugh when she was drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that when they were studying at Yale in the 1980s, the Supreme Court candidate would have shown him his genitals during a party.
World Wide Web inventor plans to launch a New Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a brand new company that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that takes advantage of the solid free platform of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored, as well as persons allowed to access such information.
In an exclusive interview given to Fast Company, Berners-Lee said jokingly that Inrupt was meant to "dominate the world."
"We have to do it now," he said about the launch.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "on-line personal data store" or DPL.
This can include contact lists, task lists, a calendar, a music library as well as other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available at the same time on a single browser.
The peculiarity of the online personal data store is that it is entirely up to the user to decide who can access what type of information.
The company calls this "personal responsibility via data".
According to the CEO of the company, John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is that the company provides appropriate resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to all.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers working on the project and a voluntary coder community.
As of this week, technological developers from around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that his team and he are not yet in discussion with "Facebook and Google" to find out whether or not to make a complete change where all their business models are completely jammed in an instant.
"We do not demand permission from them."
In a Saturday article published on Medium, Berners-Lee writes that "the mission [of'Inrupt] is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem in order to protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid".
In 1994, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating the World Wide Web Consortium.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on the net neutrality.
Although it has launched Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about this new era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of a Church of the First World War decorated with the Victoria Cross
The only churchman of the Church of England to have received the Victoria Cross during the First World War as a fighter was celebrated in his birthplace 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won this distinction on September 29, 1918, during the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucort.
However, he was killed by an elite shooter four days later and ignored that he had obtained the highest British military distinction.
His two grandsons unveiled a memorial stone during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire last Saturday.
Michael Vann, one of his grandsons, claimed that he was "shiningly symbolic" to reveal the stone exactly 100 years after the exploit of his grandfather.
According to London Gazatte, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion on the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a very thick fog and under the violent shooting of campaign cannons and machine guns".
Later, he rushed on the firing line and, with the "greatest bravery", led the line before making a campaign cannon jump on his own and assembling three soldiers from the detachment.
On October 4, 1918, a German elite shooter killed Lieutenant Colonel Vann, a little over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, claimed that his grandfather's actions were "something that I will never be, but that makes me humble."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also filed a crown after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann trusted that he felt "very honored to be part of the parade" and added that "the courage of an authentic hero is reflected in the support that many people will give him."
The mixed martial arts fans stayed awake all night to watch Bellator 206. Instead, they had Peppa Pig
Imagine this, you spent all night watching a full Bellator 206, but you couldn't see the main event.
In San José, there were 13 fights, six of them on the main record, and was broadcast live all night in the United Kingdom, on Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to meet, viewers from the United Kingdom were tuned when the broadcast changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were unhappy to stay awake until early in the morning especially for the fight.
A supporter on Twitter described the turning to the cartoon for children as "a kind of bad joke."
Regarding the transmission, the Chief Marketing and Communications Vice-President at Bellator, Dave Schwartz, stated that "the government regulation states that at 6 o'clock in the morning, this content was not appropriate, so they had to switch to children's broadcasts".
"Peppa the Pig," yes."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said they were going to work on their programming to include British viewers in the future.
"I think that when I think about recasting, I think we can probably find a solution," Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning on a Sunday and we won't be able to find any solution before Sunday, or Monday their hour.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program ran down, there were a lot of messages in both directions and they weren't all friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't a problem, it was a government issue.
I can assure you that it won't happen next time.
We will limit ourselves to five fights instead of six - as we usually do - and we have tried to give more for fans and we have spoiled everything.
It's a regrettable situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "lower" in sexuality
The Olympic diver Tom Daley claims to have grown up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality - but this has instilled in him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old man said he didn't realize before going to high school that "not everyone was like me."
As part of the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs show presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he had talked about the issue of gay rights to give others "hope."
He also said that becoming a parent had made him less interested in winning the Olympic Games.
The usual host of the show, Kirsty Young, took several months off because of her illness.
Appeared as shipwrecked in Laverne's first show, Daley confided that he felt "less than" all other children growing up because "it was socially unacceptable to love boys and girls."
He said: "Even today, these feelings of being inferior and different are the real things that have given me the power and strength needed for my success."
In order not to disappoint everyone when they finally learned the truth about his sexuality, he wanted to prove that he was "something," he continued.
The double Olympic bronze medal is now a renowned LGBT activist and has taken advantage of his participation this year in the Commonwealth Games in Australia to ask a greater number of countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he expressed himself because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without ramifications and thus wanted to give others "hope."
The triple world champion claimed that he "did not expect" to fall in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, met in 2013
Daley married Oscar's 20-year-old winner last year, but said that the age difference had never been a problem.
"When we see so much at such a young age" - he participated in his first Olympic Games at the age of 14 and his father died from cancer three years later - he said he trusted that it was difficult to find a person of the same age who had known the same heights and lows.
In June, they became the parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that "all his perspective" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, I thought I'd win a gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are things more important than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after brain cancer.
Daley confided that his father had not accepted that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked him was whether they already had their London 2012 tickets, since he wanted to sit in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him, "Dad, you won't be here to be in the first row," he said.
"I held him by my hand when he stopped breathing and he had to stop breathing and die so that I finally recognized he was not invincible," he added.
The following year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"It was all I had dreamed of all my life - diving in front of a crowd at home during the Olympic Games, there's nothing better," he said.
In addition, it inspired him his first choice of song - Heather Small's Proud - which had accompanied him in preparations for the Olympics and always gave him the chicken flesh.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11.15 a.m. BST.
An out-of-formed Mickelson on the Ryder Cup bank Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will record this Sunday by playing his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to stand up to avoid a unfortunate stage.
Mickelson, who participated in the biannual competition for the twelfth time, a record, was ruled out by Captain Jim Furyk of the fourballs and forsoms on Saturday.
Instead of being at the heart of the action, as he has so often been for the United States, the quintuple great champion shared his day between the role of supporting and the refining of his game at the stand in order to remedy his evils.
He has never been the biggest of the drivers, even at the top of his career. At 48 years of age, he is not the most suitable for the difficult National Golf, where the long rough systematically punishes the erratic blows.
And as if the course wasn't resounding enough in itself, Mickelson, during the ninth Sunday game, confronts Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, who teamed up this week with Tommy Fleetwood to win their four matches.
If the Americans, at four downs at the beginning of the 12 simple matches, start well, Mickelson's game could be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed his trust in his man, but he could not say much about anything else.
"He fully understood the role he had to play today, put a key in my back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He has great confidence in him.
He's a legendary champion and he's added so many things to these teams in the past, just like this week.
I probably didn't see him playing two games.
I expected more, but that's how it happened, and that's how we feel we have to proceed.
He wants to be there, like everyone else."
On Sunday, Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record of the largest number of meetings at the Ryder Cup.
This could mark the end of a career at the Ryder Cup that has never fully reached the heights of its individual record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven demis, although Furyk has stated that his presence has brought concrete elements to the team.
He's funny, sarcastic, spiritual, he likes to mock people, and he's a great guy to have in the team room," he explained.
"I think younger players have had the pleasure of measuring themselves to him this week, which was fun to see.
It does much more than play."
European Selection Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the advance could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant advance before the simple of the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a painful path.
The Danois played his first match in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team with the captain Seve Ballesteros had five points ahead of the Americans, but finally took the lead in the ranking with the smallest possible deviation on the finish line, taking 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You don't stop reminding yourself that we were doing much in Valderrama; we had a big advance in Brookline, where we failed, as well as in Valderrama, where we won, but fair," Bjorn said, after observing the 2018 Class, to win 5-3 at the same time Friday and yesterday at the National Golf to lead 10-6.
The story will prove to me and to all the members of this team that this is not the end.
Go deep tomorrow.
Go ahead and do whatever it takes.
It's not over before we get the points on the table.
We have a goal, namely to try to win this trophy, and that's where we need to stay focused.
I have always said to focus on the 12 players in our camp, but we are very aware of what is happening on the other side - they are the best players in the world."
Bjorn added: "I would never move forward on this point.
Tomorrow, it's another pair of sleeves.
Tomorrow, it will be the individual performances that will be presented and it will be all the same.
It's fantastic to be with a teammate when things go well, but when you're there alone, you're tested up to your full capacity as a golfer.
That's the message to pass on to players, it's to get the best of yourself tomorrow.
When we leave his partner behind himself, he must go get the best of himself, too."
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will seek to ensure that his players achieve better results individually than as teammates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have obtained three out of four points.
Furyk himself experienced the two ends of these reversals of the last day, after having been part of the winning team in Brookline before losing at the end of the "Miracle of Medinah", where Europe took the victory.
"I remember every word," he explained in answer to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had done to rally his players on the last day.
"We have 12 important meetings tomorrow, but you would like to take this quick start as you saw it in Brookline, as you saw it in Medina.
This dynamic, when going in a sense, weighs a lot of pressure on the midgames.
We have established our training accordingly and put the guys as we expect to do it, we are trying to make magic tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned the task of conducting the counter-attack and will face Rory McIllroy in the first-class duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the highest half of the ranking.
"I accompanied this group of guys in this order because I think it covers the whole course," Bjorn said on his selections in simple.
Germany's new warship still postponed
According to local media, the German Navy's new frigate should have been put into service in 2014 to replace the old warships dating from the cold war, but it will not be in service before at least next year due to defective systems and exponential expenses.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, which cites a military spokesman, the commission of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the admiral ship of all new frigates of Bade-Württemberg, was postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship should have integrated the Navy in 2014, but the post-delivery concerns have undermined the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Bade-Württemberg vessels that the Navy ordered in 2007 will replace the old frigates of the Bremen class.
It is certain that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-air and anti-aircraft missiles, as well as some furtive technologies, such as a reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signature.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the most recent frigates for a period of up to two years outside the docking ports.
However, according to Die Zeit, the unceasing delays mean that the war avant-garde ships - which should allow Germany to project its overseas force - will already be obsolete when they are put into operation.
Last year, the cursed frigate F125 made the big headlines when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship to a ship builder after its delivery.
The reasons for this return were little known, but the German media mentioned a number of "software and hardware defects" that made the warship useless in the event of deployment into combat mission.
Software failures were particularly important because Bade-Württemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, which corresponds to half of the crews of the old Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, the ship appears to be considerably overburdened, which reduces its performance and reduces the Navy's ability to make future improvements.
It is estimated that the "Rheinland-Pfalz" of 7,000 tons weighs twice as heavy as the similar class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
Beyond the failures of the computer system, the cost of the project as a whole - including the training of the crew - also becomes a problem.
It is said to have reached the astronomical sum of EUR 3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), compared to $2.2 billion initially.
The problems related to the new frigates are of particular importance in the light of recent warnings that Germany's naval force is declining.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament Defence Commission, recognized earlier this year that the Navy is in fact "short of ships able to deploy".
The manager stated that the situation had resulted in a snowball effect over time, as the old ships had been decommissioned but no replacement ships had been designated.
He regretted that none of the frigates of the Bade-Württemberg class had been able to join the Navy.
The National Trust monitors the secret life of bats
New research in a Scottish Highlands field seeks to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that the comments will shed further light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and guide future conservation activities.
The study of the National Trust for Scotland researchers will follow common bats and sopranos as well as brown long-eared bats and Daubenton in the Inverewe Garden, in Wester Ross.
Special registration devices will be placed in key locations around the property to track the activities of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using portable detectors.
Professional analysis of the sound will determine the frequency of the screams of bats and the activities of different species.
A habitat map and report will be prepared to provide a detailed picture of their behaviour across the territory.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation adviser for the NTS, hopes that the results will reveal the most important habitat areas for bats and how they are used by each of these species.
This information will determine the benefits of habitat management work such as prairies and the best way to conserve forests for bats and other related species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, bat populations have declined considerably in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects the perchs and results in the loss of their habitat.
Windmills and lighting can also represent a risk, as well as tumbling paper and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks of company cats.
The bats are not really blind.
However, given their nightly hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to identify insects and obstacles on their flight route.
Responsible for the protection of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, the NTS takes bats very seriously.
He has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, perchance inspections and sometimes rescues.
The organization also established the first and only reserve of bats of Scotland on the site of Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, which houses eight of the ten bats of Scotland.
David Thompson, domain manager, says the site is the ideal territory for them.
"Here, in Three, we have an ideal place for bats," he says.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the good habitat.
But there is still much left to learn about bats, so that the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what bats need to thrive."
It stresses the importance of verifying the presence of bats before the maintenance of the properties, because by destroying without wanting a single maternity nest, it can result in the death of 400 female and small, or even the disappearance of a whole local population.
The bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, to disturb them, or to destroy their perchs.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish head of Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to provide his assistance.
She said: "We still have much to learn about our bats and many of our species, we don't know what's going on in their populations for now."
Ronaldo refutes charges of rape while his lawyers prepare to prosecute a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described the charges of rape against him as "false information," and stated that people "wanted to be known" by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to continue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The attacker from Portugal and Juventus was accused of violating an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He would have paid her 37,000 dollars to keep her quiet about this incident, said Der Spiegel last Friday.
Addressing its 142 million fans in a video posted live on Instagram, a few hours after the allegations were broadcast, Ronaldo, 33 years old, described this information as "misinformation".
"No, no, no, no, and no.
What they said today is false information," said the five-fold winner of the Golden Ball to the camera.
"They want to become a pub by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I am a happy man and all is well," added the player smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are ready to prosecute Der Spiegel about these allegations, which they have described as "inadmissible denunciation of suspicions in the field of privacy".
Counsel Christian Schertz claimed that the player would seek compensation for "moral damages of a amount proportional to the seriousness of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of human rights in recent years."
The alleged incident would have taken place in June 2009 in a suite of the Casino Hotel Palms, Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga apparently returned to the player's room, where an anal rape would have occurred, according to documents filed with the Clark County Court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that Ronaldo got on his knees after the alleged incident and assured him to be a "99% good" guy, but he did not know what was going on with the remaining "1%".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sexual intercourse, but that they were consented.
Majorga also claimed to have visited the police and that photos of his injuries had been taken in a hospital, but that she had subsequently accepted a settlement to the amicable because she felt "reproached" and feared "to be publicly humiliated."
This 34-year-old woman states that she is now seeking to cancel this regulation because she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid by leaving Manchester United at the time of this alleged aggression, and this summer he joined the Italian giant Juve in a contract of EUR 100 million.
Brexit: The United Kingdom "would regret forever" the departure of the car manufacturers.
According to Greg Clark, the Secretary of State for Trade, the United Kingdom "would regret him forever" if it had lost its status as world leader in car construction after Brexit.
He added that it was "disquieting" that Toyota UK told the BBC that it would temporarily stop production at its Burnaston plant, near Derby, if Britain withdrew from the EU without an agreement.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer indicated that the impact of delays at the border on the eventuality of a Brexit without agreement could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures Toyota's Auris and Avensis vehicles, built nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to other countries of the European Union.
"I believe that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production will stop at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed their fear of leaving the EU without agreement on the operation of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW indicates that it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month following Brexit.
The biggest concerns are that car manufacturers qualify as risks to the Brexit supply chain without agreement.
Toyota's production line is operated in "threshold flow", parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers from the United Kingdom and the EU for vehicles manufactured on-board.
If on 29 March the United Kingdom leaves the EU without agreement, there could be disturbances at the border which, according to industry, could result in delays and loss of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep the inventory more than a day at her Derbyshire plant, said the company, and therefore the production would be stopped.
According to Clark, Theresa May's Chequer Plan for future relations with the EU is "specifically calibrated to avoid border controls".
"We need an agreement. We want to have the best agreement that will allow, as I said, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to seize this opportunity," he said in BBC Radio 4's Today.
"The obvious, not only Toyota but other manufacturers, is that we must absolutely be able to maintain what has proved to be an excellent set of supply chains."
If Toyota was unable to specify how long production would be stopped, however, it warned that in the longer term, the additional costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsoulalaris, the coordinator of the union at the factory and who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years, said that his members were increasingly concerned: "My experience has shown that once these jobs are gone, they never come back."
A government spokesman said: "We have proposed a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU."
The White House announces that Trump and Rosenstein's meeting could still be delayed
According to the announcement made on Sunday by the White House, the meeting, which presents important issues, between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "rejected for a week", while the struggle for the candidate for Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller, the Special Adviser responsible for investigating Russian interference in the elections, the links between Trump's collaborators and Russia and the possible obstacles to the justice exercised by the President.
The question of whether Trump will return the Deputy Attorney General or not, and thus endanger Mueller's independence, has been feeding rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had spoken of wearing a microphone to record talks with Trump and the possibility of eliminating the president by the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied those assertions.
However, last Monday, he introduced himself to the White House, while he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then in the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said that he "would rather not" refer Mr. Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a confrontation with the hearing of the Senate Judicial Commission against which Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford testified, one of the women who accused him of sexual assault.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to conduct a one-week inquiry into complaints against Kavanaugh, still delaying the vote in the Senate.
On Sunday, Trump's press attack, Sarah Sanders, appeared in Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "No date has been set for this, it could be this week, I could see if one more week is rejected given all the other things that happen to the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I like to keep the press up."
The statement would be disputed by some journalists: Since September 10, Sanders has held no press conference at the White House.
Animate Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the rareness of the conferences was not due to an aversion to the "demagogic" television reporters, although she said, "I have nothing against the fact that they are breaking the gallery."
Then she suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
Without mentioning any evidence, she added that "the President participates in more questions-response sessions than any other president before him": "We have checked the figures."
Press conferences will always be held, Sanders said, but "if the press has the chance to question the President of the United States directly, it is infinitely better than talking to me.
We are trying to do it frequently, you have seen it in recent weeks, and it will take place in a press conference where you can speak to the President of the United States."
Regularly, Trump answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public meetings or press conferences with dignitaries.
It's rare that the press conferences are being held in private.
This week, in New York, the president may have demonstrated why, by making a casual appearance and at times an odd appearance in front of the journalists assembled.
About Brexit's fears, the secretary to Health wrote to EU workers in NHS Scotland
The Secretary for Health wrote to EU officials working within the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude and wish them to remain in office after Brexit.
Scottish Parliamentarian Jeane Freeman sent a letter within six months before the United Kingdom withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already undertaken to cover the cost of applications for status for European citizens working in its decentralized public services.
Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations on withdrawal continued between the United Kingdom and the EU and should lead to decisions this fall.
But the British Government has also stepped up its preparations in the event of a lack of agreement.
I understand that this period must be very disturbing for each of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of his nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond provide valuable experience and skills that consolidate and improve the work of health services, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is really your home and we really want you to stay here."
After a head injury, Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery
According to Mike Organ of Tennessee State, Christion Abercrombie, the deputy of the Tennessee Tigers, was operated urgently after a head injury on Saturday during the defeat of the Vanderbilt Commodores 31-27.
Rod Reed, the head coach of the State of Tennessee, told journalists that the injury had occurred just before the mid-time.
"He arrived on the key line and collapsed there," Reed said.
Coaches and medical personnel administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the touch line before placing it on a cider and taking it another test.
A representative of the state of Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was out of the Vanderbilt Medical Center operating room.
Harris said there was still no "explanation of the type or extent of the injury" and that the State of Tennessee was trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second year athlete, is in its first season with the State of Tennessee after its transfer from Illinois.
He had five placards in total on Saturday before leaving the match, which brought his total of the season to 18 placards.
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp rights if they buy property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp rights if they buy property in the United Kingdom and additional money will be used to help homeless people under the new Conservative regimes
This measure will cancel the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Treasury expects to collect up to 120 million Sterling pounds per year to help homeless people.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp duty rate if they buy property in the UK - the extra money will help homeless people, Theresa May will announce today.
This will be seen as an initiative to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters by undertaking to provide more affordable housing and target high-income people.
The increase in stamping rights will be imposed on individuals and businesses that do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and additional money will serve to strengthen government efforts in the struggle to help homeless people.
This surcharge - which is added to the current stamp law, including the higher levels established two years ago on secondary residences and rental purchases - could be up to 3%.
The Treasury expects the project to collect up to 120 million Sterling books per year.
About 13 per cent of London's new constructions are purchased by non-residents from the United Kingdom, which increases prices and prevents first-persons from making a place in the housing market.
Many rich areas of the country - particularly in the capital - have become "fantom cities" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time living outside the country.
This new policy only occurs a few weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a reduction in stamping rights to help more young people acquire a first home.
Accusing large construction companies to maintain real estate prices at a high level by taking land without using them, he invited Ms. May to waive quotas on affordable housing in order to settle the "real estate disaster" that plagues the United Kingdom.
Mr. Corbyn presented an attractive series of reform proposals in the housing sector, including rent control and removal of "impossible" evictions.
He also wished to give advice on broader powers to build new housing.
May said: "Last year, I said that I would dedicate my position as Prime Minister to the rebirth of the British dream - that every new generation would have a better life.
To do this, we need to repair our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to all those who want to live, work and build a life here.
It is unfair, however, that it is as easy for individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as for foreign companies to buy a house as well as for British residents who work hard.
For many too many people, the dream of accessing the property has become far away and the poverty of homeless people remains too real."
Jack Ross: My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland.
Sunderland's technician, Jack Ross, explains that his "excellent ambition" is to become the Scottish picker at some point.
The 42-year-old Scotsman is pleased to meet the challenge of rebirth of the North-East club, which now occupies the third place of League 1, at three points of the leader.
He joined the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren into the Premier League, Scotland last season.
"I had to play for my country as a player.
I was selected for Division B and that's all," Ross told BBC Scotland Sportssound.
"But I grew up following the Scottish matches in Hampden with my father, and that's something I've never forgotten.
This opportunity would only present itself if I succeed in managing the club."
Ross' predecessors as selectrs of Sunderland are Dick Advocat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Aloa Athletic's former technician states that he has not hesitated to place himself behind such emblematic names in such a large club, having already declined the proposals of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, the success of the moment will be measured in the light of the question "Can I bring this club back to the First League?"
From the structure and infrastructure of this club, it undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he added.
"It's not easy to get there, but I probably wouldn't consider myself a success here unless I could bring the club back there."
Ross has only three years of career as a coach, after a period as a coach in Dumbarton and 15 months in Hearts coaches.
He then helped Alloa get back from a third division relegation and turned St Mirren, who was on the edge of the relegation, into a big winner of the championship the following season.
Ross is now more comfortable than during his career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
The takeover of Alloa "probably was a real crossroads," he recalled.
"I really felt that being a coach was better for me than playing.
It seems strange because I got out of it, that I earned my life well, and that I took advantage of some valuable summits.
But playing is sometimes difficult.
There's a lot of details to deal with every week.
I continue to live this in terms of stress and stress at work, but being a coach is fine for me.
I have always wanted to lead and now I do, I feel more comfortable in my skin than I have been in my entire adult life."

According to a survey, the ideal time for a brush is 5.30 p.m. on Saturday.
The summer canicle has raised the incomes of the British pubs in difficulty, but has increased the pressure on the restaurant chains.
The figures indicate that the bar and pub groups recorded an increase of 2.7% in their sales in July, but the revenues in the restaurants fell by 4.8 .
Peter Martin, of the CGA Council Office, who compiled the data, said: "The permanent sunny and longer-than-expected participation of England in the World Cup resulted in July following the June model, where bars had experienced an increase of 2.8%, except for restaurants, which had been further shocked.
The decline of 1.8 per cent in the restoration sector in June only came to an end in July.
Pubs and bars where alcoholic beverages are used are by far the most in vogue, with more points of similarity than the lower restaurants.
Food pubs have also suffered from the effects of the sun, but not as much as the restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to come out and have a drink.
In pubs and bars, drinks sales increased by 6.6% over the month, and food decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman, a specialist analyst for leisure and hospitality RSM, said: "These results follow the trend observed since late April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the most important factors with regard to out-of-home sales.
It is not surprising that restoration groups continue to experience difficulties, although a decrease in annual sales of 4.8 per cent is particularly painful, in addition to continuing pressure on costs.
The long and hot summer could not have been less convenient for food business operators and time would have told us whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August would have been worth a good time."
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in the implementation.
Industry sales are monitored by the Coffer Peach Tracker for UK pubs, bars and restaurants, which collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of over 9 billion Sterling books and constitutes the standard in the established industry.
On social media, one in five children has secret accounts that they hide from their parents
According to one survey, one in five children - some of whom are only 11 years old - have secret social media accounts that he hides from his parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in "false Insta" pages
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual content
20% of students reported having a "main" account to show their parents
One in five children - some of whom are only 11 - open a social media account that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed rapid growth in the "false Insta" accounts - a reference to the Instagram photo sharing site.
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
20% of students reported managing a "main" account cleaned to show it to their parents, while having a private account.
A mother who accidentally fell on the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter discovered a teenager who was urging others to "violent me."
According to the study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools, 40% of young people between 11 and 18 years of age have a double profile, half of the students recognizing to have private accounts.
CSM leader Mike Buchanan said: "It's worrying that so many teenagers are trying to create online places where parents and teachers don't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will represent athletes at the Scottish Athletics Board of Directors.
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Board of Directors as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated Scottish athlete in athletics and President Ian Beattie has described this as an excellent opportunity for the leaders of this sport to take advantage of his vast international experience over the past ten years.
"Eilidh enjoys immense respect within the community of Scottish, British and world athletics and we are sure that athletics in Scotland would greatly benefit from his participation in the Council," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I really want to be the voice of athletes and I really want to be able to make my contribution and guide this sport in Scotland."
The American, who won in 1996 the 200-metre and 400-metre test at the Atlanta Olympic Games where he won four gold medals and is now a regular BBC commentator, was unable to walk after a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors said that only time would tell me if I would get back or to what extent.
It was a tough job, but I got it all back, I learned how to walk again, and today I'm doing agile exercises!

Online, an advertising about milking that compares mothers and cows divides opinions
An online advertising of a company offering a milk shoot compares sucking mothers to cows during trafficking.
In order to mark the launch of what is called "the first silent milk shoot in the world," Elvie, a company of public technology, launched a bold advertising inspired by a music video to show the freedom that her new milk pull offers to breastfeeding women.
In a cow's barn full of hay, four real mothers dance at the rhythm of a song whose words are: "Yes, I hate myself, but you don't see a tail" and "In case you didn't notice it, it's my breasts, no tits."
The refresher continues: "Put it, pump it, feed the babies, pump it, pump it, pump it, help the women milking."
However, advertising, which has been published on the company's Facebook page, has sparked an online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received contradictory reactions from the public, many of which say that it sheds light on the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
"A poor decision to use cows to promote this product.
Like us, they must become pregnant and give birth to milk, except that their babies are taken from them in the days that follow their birth," wrote one of them.
The Elvie milk shoot adapts discreetly in a breastfeeding bra (Elvie/Mère)
Another commented: "It's a understandable trauma for the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a milking for mothers who keep their baby?"
Someone else added: "A commercial so disconnected."
Others defended advertising, for example a woman admitting that she found the song " hilarious".
"I think it's an idea of genius.
I'd have bought one if I was still breast-feeding.
Pomper made me feel like I was a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
It's a great product," someone wrote.
Another commented: "It's a fun advertisement for mothers who milk their milk (often on their workplace or toilets) and feel like cows.
It is not an advertising that praises the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, women revealed that they had danced with the discretes hidden in their bra-gorge.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the idea that many women who use the milk shoot say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie's milk shoot is completely silent, without wires or pipes and is discreetly inserted into a nursing bra, which gives women the freedom to move, hold their baby and even get out while milking.
Ana Balarin, partner and DPE at Mother commented: "The Elvie milk shoot is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By paralleling breastfeeding mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on the extraction of breast milk and all its challenges, while expressing in a fun and reliable way the incredible feeling of freedom that this new milk will provide.
This isn't the first time that Elvie's milk shoot does one of the newspapers.
During the fashion week in London, a mother of two children appeared on the podium of designer Marta Jakubowski while she used this product.
Hundreds of migrant children settled quietly in a camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has increased considerably, although the number of monthly border crossings remained relatively stable, partly due to the fact that the Trump administration's harsh speeches and policies have complicated the placement of children in respondents.
Traditionally, most respondents were themselves undocumented immigrants, and they feared to compromise their own possibility of staying in the country through the rescue of a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential respondents and adult members of their homes should submit their fingerprints and that these data would be transmitted to immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Service, testified last week before the Congress that the Agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The Agency subsequently confirmed that 70% of persons arrested had no legal record.
"Almost 80% of those who are respondents or members of their families are illegally here, and many of them are foreign criminals.
Therefore, we continue to prosecute these people," said Albence.
According to refugee speakers, in order to deal more quickly with the case of children, the authorities have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear before the court within the month of their detention, rather than after 60 days, which was the standard previously.
Many of them will appear by videoconference, rather than in person, to plead their case in relation to their legal status before an immigration judge.
Persons deemed not eligible will be expelled quickly.
According to the speakers and reports that have been submitted in recent months through the shelter network, the longer the children remain in detention, the more they are likely to become anxious or depressed, which may lead to outbursts of violence or attempts to escape.
In a large establishment like Tornillo, these concerns are exacerbated by the fact that the signs that a child is in difficulty are more likely to be neglected because of its size, according to the child's rights defenders.
They added that moving children to camp without giving them time to prepare themselves emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends could accentuate a trauma that many have a hard time to manage.
Syria calls on the American, French and Turkish "occupational forces" to withdraw in the field.
In a statement to the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem also called for Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in that country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil, on the pretext of combating terrorism, and that they "would be treated accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the assembly.
Moualem argued that the "war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, while more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions of others have been uprooted from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue "to carry on this sacred battle until all Syrian territories were purged" from both terrorist groups and from any "illegal foreign presence".
The United States has some 2,000 soldiers in Syria, most of whom form and advise the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces opposing President Bachar al-Assad.
In this war-torn country, France has over 1,000 soldiers on site.
Moualem said regarding refugees, that conditions were favourable for their return, and accused "some Western countries" of "pleading irrational concerns" that have deterred refugees from returning.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to make these returns easier," he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union stated that there would be no support for Syria's reconstruction until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end this war would not be concluded.
The United Nations diplomats claim that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last rebel fortress in Idlib has led to progress in political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement avoided a large-scale assault on the province where three million people live, by Syrian forces supported by Russia.
However, Moualem pointed out that the agreement provided for "specific deadlines" and hoped that military measures would target jihadists, in particular the combatants of the Nusra Front, who are related to Al-Qaeda and "will be eliminated".
Staffan de Mistura, a representative of the United Nations, hopes soon to convene the first meetings of a new committee bringing together members of the government and the opposition to draft a post-war constitution and prepare the way for the elections in Syria.
Moualem defined the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that the work of the group should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution", and formulated a warning against any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Mr. Trump would be re-elected in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers probably expect, destitution and scandal lead him to leave his presidency prematurely.
What would probably be "The most spectacular finish of a presidency!"
At the moment, the public shows no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, peak hour ratings have more than doubled, reaching 1.05 million on CNN, and have nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at large hours, compared to 1.7 million years ago, and MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show, which has reached 3.5 million viewers during the big evenings, is the first cable television channel.
"It's a case that attracts people because it's not something we understand," commented Neal Baer, the dramaist of the ABC "designated Survivor" that speaks of a minister who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a popular comic author and author of "Just the Funny Parts : And some irrefutable truths about sneaking into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
She remembers taking a taxi to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why, she asked him.
"He said, "Because he makes me laugh," said Mrs. Scovell.
Chaos have a playful value.
Obviously, unlike anything on television, the Washington scenarios could determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, whether immigrant families can meet and the health of the world economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most fortunate viewers can afford.
And yet, this goes beyond being an informed citizen when one finds himself watching for six hours a panel of experts discuss how Bob Woodward used a "deep know-how" for his "Fear" book on the rubber leather veston at Paul Manafort's $15,000 ("a puffed-up dress" according to Washington Post) and the consequences of the extravagant descriptions that Stormy Daniels delivered from, uh, Mr. Trump's anatomy.
On my side, I'll never see Super Mario the same way.
"If part of what he's doing seems to be seeing a tele-reality show, it's because he makes you swallow something every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about Trump's changing teams and daily changes of situation (to fight with the NFL, to congratulate Kim Jong-un).
We can't afford to miss an episode if we're on the trail.
When I contacted Mr.Fleiss this week, he was 26 degrees home on the north bank of Kauai, but he would sit inside to watch MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not stand aside, not with Brett Kavanaugh, who was preparing to face the Senate's Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
"I remember when we were encouraging all these crazy shows and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right."

The money from the outside invades the tightest elections in mid-term
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania is flooded with money, thanks to an adjustment of the Congress's constituencies, which allowed two holders to fight the same seat.
This district of Pittsburgh suburb, which has recently been restructured, is the seat of the Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who took his seat in another electoral district in the special elections last spring.
Lamb is measured by another licensee, Republican Keith Rothfus, currently representing the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, which greatly overlaps the new 17th district.
The maps were re-drawn when the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old arrondissements were unconstitutionally manipulated in favour of Republicans.
The New 17th District race gave rise to a confrontation with the funding of electoral campaigns between the major branches of party funding, the Congress Committee for the Democratic Campaign (CCCD) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (CNCR).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a victory won by justice last March in a very popular special election in the 18th district of the Congress of Pennsylvania.
This seat was held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the 20-point district victory.
Politologists have given democrats a slight benefit.
The United States has considered penalizing Salvador for its support for China, and then has dropped
Diplomats found that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, which Washington had little to do with.
Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until partners expelled the Trump Organization's leadership.
The representatives of the State Department decided to convene the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama to protest "their recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the Department's spokesperson, at the beginning of the month in a communiqué.
But sanctions were only planned against Salvador, who received US aid estimated at $140 million in 2017, including to control narcotics and provide development and economic support.
The sanctions envisaged, which included reductions in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high rates of unemployment and homicide.
As internal meetings continued, representatives of North America and Central America delayed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar meeting that took place last year, seen as an advance in efforts to prevent immigrants from travelling to the United States.
But in mid-September, the senior officials of the administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, thus ending any consideration of sanctions against the Salvadoran.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now able to speak at the conference, scheduled for mid-October, in order to demonstrate the importance that the administration attaches to the meeting, the diplomats have made known.
And the three U.S. issuers returned quietly to Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without new messages or severe punishments from Washington.
A spokesperson for Mr. Bolton at the White House refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American dignitaries, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations under the cover of the anonymity.
Their statements were corroborated by an independent analyst close to the administration, who also remained anonymous.
Study History
The next tile could be the report of Special Lawyer Robert Mueller on the possible impediment to Mr. Trump's justice. The public file is now supported by substantial evidence.
Mr. Mueller would also direct his inquiry into the question of a conniving of Mr. Trump's campaign with Russia in his attack on our elections.
If the control of Congress changes its hand, Mr. Trump will find himself accountable to this body, when he is ready to stand before the electorate and, perhaps, before a jury composed of his peers.
These are many "yes", and I do not claim that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable - or that of his counterparts in Europe.
We all have decisions to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the potential duration of this struggle.
In 1938 the German officers were about to hold a coup against Hitler, if only the West had held him head and pushed the Czechoslovakians back in Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the following years of carnage.
The course of history revolves around these cleavages and the inescapable walk of democracy is accelerating or delayed.
The Americans are currently facing a number of these cleavages.
What will we do if Mr. Trump refers the deputy to Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of the investigation conducted by Mr. Mueller?
Rosenstein has been in a sensitive situation since this newspaper reported that last year he proposed to register the President in secret and issued assumptions about his inability to perform his duties.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is inaccurate.
"What will we answer if the recent FBI investigation on Brett Kavanaugh is not exhaustive or impartial - or if it is entrusted to the Supreme Court despite accusations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote in mid-term elections for a Congress to hold an account for Mr. Trump?
If we do not succeed in these trials, democracy will spend a long winter.
But I am convinced that we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz under the Nazi regime, who in the past occupied my residence as an ambassador.
She survived, immigrated to America and, sixty years later, sent me to light candles of the Sabbath on the table tree the swastika.
With this heritage, I cannot be optimistic about our future."

Graham Dorrans des Rangers, trusting the Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will receive the Rapid Vienna Thursday, while knowing that the victory against the Austrians, following the impressive null match in Spain against Villarreal at the beginning of the month, will place them in a solid position to qualify as Group G in the League Europe.
A knee injury deprived Graham Dorrans field center of his first participation from the season until the null 2:2 game against Villarreal, but he is convinced that the Rangers are able to make the best of such a result to realize exploits.
"It was a positive point for us, because Villarreal is a quality team," commented the 31-year-old attacker.
"We got into the game thinking about getting something and we started with a point.
Perhaps we could have won it at the end, but overall, a null match was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we returned in the second half and we were the best team.
Thursday is another important European evening.
With a bit of luck, we can hope to get three points, but it will be a difficult match because they made a good result during their last match, however I am sure that we can continue and get a positive result with the crowd behind us.
Last year was really difficult, between my injuries and the changes that were made to the club as such, but there is a factor of satisfaction about this place now.
The team is good and the guys have a lot of fun; the training is of quality.
Let's hope we can go ahead now, leave the last season behind us and triumph."
Women no longer find sleep because of this fear of their retirement savings
Although the participants in this survey clearly knew how they wanted to be cared for, few people talked about the issue with their families.
Nearly half of those who participated in the national study said that they were talking with their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent reported having spoken to their children.
"People want a member of their family to take care of them, but they don't do the necessary thing to have this conversation," said Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the Life Insurance Branch of Nationwide.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can't prepare your family to provide you with care if you don't communicate your wishes well in advance.
Work with your advisor and family to determine where and how you can receive care, as these options can be an important factor in determining their cost.
Call your financial advisor: Your advisor is also able to help you establish a way to pay these fees.
Your decisions on long-term care funding may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with a purchase value to help you cover these expenses or other insurance on your heritage - provided you have the means to ensure it.
Prepare your legal documents: Avoid legal battles at the crossing.
Provide a health-care procuration that will allow you to designate a trusted person who will check your medical care and ensure that professionals respect your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Consider also a proxy for your financial resources.
You would choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure payment of your bills if you are incapacitated.
Think about the details: Suppose your elderly parent has a medical emergency and goes to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
List these details in a written document to be well prepared.
"Is there only the finances that are at stake, but also who are the doctors?" asked Martin.

A man has been wounded several times with a compressed air rifle in Ilfracombe
One man received several bullets fired with a compressed air rifle as he walked home from a night.
The victim, who was about forty years old, was in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracombe, in Devon, when he was shot in the chest, belly and hand.
The police described the incident, which took place around 2:30 a.m. BST, as a " Random Act".
The victim didn't see his assailant.
His injuries do not threaten his life, and the police have made a call to witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, the authorities announced, and the balance sheet should grow.
Since communications were paralysed, the relief services were unable to receive any information from the regency of Donggala, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated as a result of the disaster.
A few essential facts about Palu and Donggala on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the tip of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi, whose population was estimated to be 379 800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami took place.
Donggala is a Regency that is more than 300 km (180 miles) long off coasts to the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The population of the regency, an administrative region below a province, was estimated to be 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy of the central Sulawesi province, and especially the coastal region of Donggala.
The extraction of nickel is also an important activity in the province, but it is mainly located in Morrowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunamis several times over a century, according to the Indonesian Agency for Disaster Reduction.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is situated on the Pacific seismic circle and is regularly shaken by earthquakes.
Some of the main earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years are:
2004: A major earthquake, which occurred on 26 December on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, triggered a tsunami that spread over 14 countries, causing 226 000 casualties on the Indian Ocean coast, of which more than half were in Aceh.
2005: Several violent earthquakes shook the west coast of Sumatra in late March at the beginning of April.
A few hundred people died on Nias Island, off Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake reached southern Java, Indonesia's most inhabited island, triggering a tsunami that struck the south coast and struck nearly 700 victims.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake shook the city of Padang, capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake devastated one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of over 10 metres that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A superficial earthquake shook the resistance of Pidie Jaya to Aceh, causing destruction and panic, reminding the inhabitants of the devastation caused by the earthquake and the 2004 deadly tsunami.
No tsunami was caused this time, but more than 100 people were killed by the collapse of buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes have rocked the Indonesian tourism island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed several thousand buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily blocked.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for marital violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault.
Palin, aged 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was questioned for suspicions of marital violence, contravening a report of marital violence and resisting arrest, as reported in a press release published on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, he would have taken the phone call from a woman's acquaintance who was trying to call the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is in pre-trial detention in the Mat-Su pre-trial detention centre and is held under unsecured bail of $500, said KTUU.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, declaring himself "not guilty, surely" when his plea was asked for him, announced the network.
Palin faces three Class A offences, which means that he may be sentenced to imprisonment for up to one year and is liable to a fine of $250,000.
He was also charged with a minor offence of Class B, punishable by a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted the police to report this alleged assault.
The case is pending before the Alaskan Veterans' Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with marital violence, interference in the report of a crime of domestic violence and possession of a weapon in a state of drunkenness in connection with the incident.
His partner claimed he had hit him in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans in 2016 after linking his son's violent behavior with the PTSD resulting from his service in Iraq.
earthquake in Indonesia: several hundred deaths
At least 384 people died as a result of the earthquake that shook the Indonesian island of Sulawesi last Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and devastated thousands of homes.
Electricity and telecommunications networks are failing, and the balance of victims is expected to grow in the coming days.
The earthquake came just off the centre of Sulawesi, north-east of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Social media videos show the point of impact.
Several hundred people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu at the time the tsunami broke down on the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand a rare death penalty for a suspected terrorist attack in New York City
New York federal prosecutors are calling for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the alleged assaulter in New York who has killed eight victims - a rare penalty that has not been applied in New York for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, aged 30, would have used a rented truck at Home Depot to attack a cyclable track on the West Side Highway, in Lower Manhattan, driving pedestrians and a cyclist on his road last October.
In order to justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to provide evidence that Saipov has “intentionally” murdered the eight victims and “intentionally” inflicted serious bodily harm, according to the statement of intent to apply for capital punishment from the Southern District of New York.
Both charges are likely to result in the death penalty, according to the judicial document.
A few weeks after this attack, a federal grand jury sentenced Saipov to 22 counts, including eight counts of murder for extortion of funds, generally used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases and one for crimes of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "a thorough preparation and premeditation," said the prosecutors, calling the method used by Saipov "hateful, cruel and depraved".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," says the statement of intent.
Five of the victims were Argentinian tourists.
The southern district of New York had not claimed the death penalty for ten years in prosecution.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug traffickers but was subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a New York federal case was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed to commit conspiracy and espionage for the USSR during the two years that followed the Cold War.
Both Rosenberg were executed by electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, who was from Uzbekistan, demonstrated a lack of remorse in the days and months that followed the tragedy, according to judicial documents.
According to the police, he told investigators that he was content with his actions.
Saipov told the authorities that he had been prompted to attack after watching Daesh videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to display the Daesh flag in his hospital room, said the police.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was "disappointed" in the decision to prosecute.
"We believe that the decision to apply for the death penalty rather than accept his plea for guilt and condemn him to the prison for life without the possibility of release can only prolong trauma related to these events for all concerned," Patton said.
The Saipov defence team had already asked prosecutors not to claim the death penalty.
A Conservative Member states that NIGEL FARAGE should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Today, Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the People's Army" during a demonstration at the Conservative conference.
The former party for the independence of the United Kingdom indicated that politicians should "feel pressure" on Euroseptics - as one of the Members of Theresa May suggested, he should be in charge of negotiating with the EU.
The Conservative postman Peter Bone stated at Birmingham's march that the United Kingdom "would have already been released" if Mr Farage had been secretary to Brexit.
But the dilemma that Mrs May is facing to reconcile her deeply divided troops was emphasized by the Conservatives in favour of the idea of staying in the Union which joined an isolated demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is having trouble maintaining his Chequers compromise plan despite the threats of those who want to leave and those who want to remain as well as the EU.
The Allies stressed that it would pursue its attempts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the hostilities - and would force Euroseptics and workers to choose between its programme and the chaos.
Mr. Bone told the Assembly of the Leave Mean Leave in Solihull that he wanted to "get rid of Chequers."
He felt that Mr Farage should have become a partner and that he was given the burden of negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we'd already be out," he said.
Wellingborough MP added: "I will defend Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers."
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he continued: "We have not delivered ourselves into world wars to submit ourselves.
We want to make our own legislation in our own homeland."
Mr. Bone ruled out the suggestions that public opinion had evolved since the vote in 2016: "The idea that the British people turned the page and wanted to stay is completely false."
The conservative Andrea Jenkyns, in favour of exit, was also present at the march and told the journalists: "I'm just saying, Madam Prime Minister, listen to people.
Chequers are not appreciated by the general public, the opposition will not vote for, it is also the case of our party and our militants who ride the streets and make us choose first and foremost.
Abandon Chequers and start listening."
In a message addressed to Mrs. May, she added: Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they honor their promises."
"Mr Farage told the assembly that politicians should be forced to "feel pressure" if they were about to betray the decision that was taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a question of trust between us - the people - and our political class," he said.
They try to deceive Brexit, and we say to them today: "We will not let you out like this."
He added in a message addressed to the enthusiastic crowd: "I want you to feel the pressure to our political class that is about to betray Brexit.
We mobilize the popular army of this country that has enabled us to win the victory in Brexit and we will not stop until we become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, pro-European followers walked through Birmingham before organizing a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small number of activists have branded conservative banners against Brexit after the group's launch this weekend.
His fellow worker Lord Adonis mocked Conservatives because of the security issues concerning the application of the party at the beginning of the conference.
"They assure us that they are able to put in place computer systems and all technology for Canada, more, for the friction-free border, for free trade without frontiers in Ireland," he added.
"It's a real farce.
A good Brexit, it doesn't exist," he added.
Warren intends to seriously consider presenting himself at the presidential elections
On Saturday, Senator Elizabeth Warren said that she would seriously consider presenting herself to the presidential elections after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts democrat discussed his future on Saturday at a public assembly in the west of Massachusetts.
Warren, a voice often critical of President Donald Trump, is present for the re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, a representative of the GOP in States, who was co-chaired in 2016 for the Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
She found herself at the center of speculation that she could face Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters at a public meeting since Trump took office.
One participant asked whether she intended to attend the Chair.
Warren replied that the time had come "for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, which means that we have a woman at the head of the state."
Arresting the death by ball of Sims from the University of State of Louisiana
On Saturday, Baton Rouge police in Louisiana announced that a suspect had been arrested in connection with the death by basketball player Wayde Sims, a basketball player from LSU on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Service participated in the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 years, at 11 a.m. HE. Press conference.
On Friday, they had published a video of the shooting, asking for help to identify a man who was on the images.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot on Friday morning, near the Southern University campus.
“Wayde Sims got a bullet wound in his head and succumbed to his injuries,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday at 247 sports.
Wayde took his friend's defense and was shot down by Simpson.
Questioned, Simpson admitted to finding himself on the spot, in possession of a gun, and shooting at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and placed in custody at the East Baton Rouge parish police station.
Sims, a young 2 m who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games, 10 of them as last season, and totaled an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per match.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton turns to the world title after the team's guidelines have enabled him to win the victory against Sebastian Vettel
It soon became evident from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified to advance Lewis Hamilton last Saturday that the Mercedes team's instructions would play an important role in the competition.
From the pole position, Bottas took a good start and collided Hamilton on the flank as he defended his place on the first two laps, and invited Vettel to attack his team partner.
Vettel entered the booths first and left Hamilton to throw himself into the peloton's tail torment, which should have been a decisive element.
Mercedes passed through the booths a later turn and found itself behind Vettel, but Hamilton took the advantage after a wheeled action that saw Ferrari's pilot leave the inner part at risk of resisting a double defence attempt in the third turn.
Max Verstappen left the last line of the grid and was seventh at the end of the first round to celebrate his 21st birthday.
He then dominated a large part of the race while maintaining his tires to target a speeding arrival and forward Kimi Raikkonen to fourth place.
He finally arrived at the stands at the 44th tower, but was unable to accelerate the pace in the remaining eight towers, Raikkonen clapping fourth.
It's a difficult day because Valtteri has done a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman who let me pass.
The team did an exceptional job to get a two," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language.
At a meeting last Saturday, President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Diane Feinstein, who stressed that she had not unveiled Christine Blasey Ford's letter that accused the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford's testimony before the Senate's judicial committee, but he argued that the events that took place in the Senate showed that people were "violent, disgusting and dishonest."
"The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that has happened in the Senate these last days, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and disgusting and dishonest," he said.
"When they saw the disclosures and leaks, they said, "Oh, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you disclose any information?
Remember his answer... did you disclose information - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't disclose anything."
Well, wait a minute.
We have disclosed information... No, we have not disclosed information," he added, thinking to the honourable senator's impression.
Feinstein received the letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh last July, and the disclosure took place in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
"I didn't cover up Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't disclose his story," Feinstein told the committee, said The Hill.
"She told me to keep this confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked me."
But his denial does not appear to be well received by the president, who commented on Saturday evening at the gathering: "I will tell you, it was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
In pursuing his defence of the candidate for the Supreme Court, accused of sexual assault by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats used these allegations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power by all means.
You see the wickedness, the pettyness, they care about who they hurt, who they have to crush to gain power and control," said the president to Mediaite.
Elite League : Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars wiped out their Friday defeat in Elite League against Belfast Giants by kicking the 5-3 match back to Dundee last Saturday.
The Giants opened the score with two goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought equality back to home before Dwyer returned the benefit to the Giants.
François Bouchard equaled for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen entered two goals, ensuring their victory.
This was the third defeat of the season in Elite League for the players of Adam Keefe, who had beaten Dundee 2-1 Friday evening in Belfast, after being caught.
This was the fourth confrontation of the season between the two camps, the Giants having triumphed in the last three matches.
Dwyer gave the advantage at the fourth minute, at 3:35, thanks to a pass from Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford served Beauvillier who doubled the set four minutes later.
During a very busy first period, Sullivan revived the local team at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt went to Cownie's service, at 15:16, with an equalization.
Dwyer assured the Giants ahead of the first break when he hit his second goal of the evening towards the end of the first period.
The local team met and Bouchard again equaled with a goal giving a numerical advantage at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran collaborated to help Nielsen place Dundee in the lead for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, thus ensuring victory for his team by marking a fifth goal in the mid-term.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five matches, will host Milton Keynes at their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller died by assisting hundreds of people aboard an aircraft to escape the earthquake.
An Indonesian air traffic controller is hailed as a hero after he died ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people can safely take off.
More than 800 people died and many others died after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi last Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong replicas continue to ravage the region and a large number of people are trapped under debris in the city of Palu.
But despite the flight of his colleagues, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunanang General refused to give up his position in the violently rocked tower at Mutiara Sis Al-Jufri airport in Palu.
He remained on site to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at that time, could take off safely.
He then jumped out of the control tower when he felt it would collapse.
He died later at the hospital.
Yohannes Siriat, the spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, stated that this action could have saved hundreds of lives, according to ABC News australian.
We mobilized a Balikpapan helicopter in Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
"Our heart is broken to learn this," he added.
The authorities fear that the number of deaths can reach thousands, the country's disaster reduction agency indicating that access to cities in Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The balance sheet would continue to grow because many bodies were still under the debris and a large number could not be helped," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency's spokesman
Waves measuring up to six metres devastated Palu, which will celebrate a Sunday mass burial.
Military and commercial aircraft provide support and food.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute, an ambulance takes the bodies back.
Clean water is rare.
The mini-markets are looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indian Red Cross is short to help survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find.
It's already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
Joko Widodo, Indonesian president, arrived in Palu Sunday and addressed the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" said CNN.
Indonesia had been shaken earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok, which had killed more than 550 people.
Aircraft accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now states that a man has disappeared after the crash of a plane in the lagoon.
The airline that operated the flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now claims that a man is being taken away, after the 47 passengers and crew members safely evacuated the flight that flowed.
Air Niugini said in a press release that since Saturday afternoon, she was unable to find the trace of a male passenger.
The airline indicated that it collaborated with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate the man in question.
The airline did not immediately respond to more specific requests for information about the passenger, such as its age or nationality.
Local vessels participated in the rescue of other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water by trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
The authorities said on Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline claimed on Saturday that six passengers were still in the hospital, and they were all in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact course of events remain uncertain.
The airline and the US Navy reported that the plane landed in the lagoon near the runway.
Witnesses thought the plane had crossed the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had arrived too low.
"It's a very good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and the others had been able to slide into the water until the aircraft's rescue exits were flowing.
He claimed that the flight attendants had panicked and screamed, and he suffered from a minor injury to his head.
The U.S. Navy claimed that sailors who worked close to improving a quay had also participated in rescue by using a pneumatic boat to transport people to the mainland before the aircraft flowed in about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
Air Safety Network data indicate that 111 people died in airline accidents registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none of them concerned Air Niugini.
Analyst presents the chronology of the night the woman was burned alive
The prosecution adjourned its file on Saturday during the trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used records of phone calls from a cell phone to trace the movements of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night that the defendant died.
Rowlett reported that he had obtained localization data from several mobile phones that indicated that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, which contradicted his previous statements, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers while he claimed to meet with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to Sanford.
Sanford showed up at the Saturday bar and testified he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked whether Tellis had told the truth when he said he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford replied that he "was lying, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistencies are that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Phone records show they've known each other for a week.
Rowlett stated that sometime after Chambers' death, Tellis removed the SMS, calls and contact details of Chambers from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," Hale said.
The defense must begin its fights on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be held before the jury during the day.

The High Breed of Bristol claims that hip hop has distanced itself from its origins of political messages and social problems.
The group wants to renew with its roots and make hip hop political again popular.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common experienced a recent resurgence in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another Black?!
A New York New York Newman continues a couple in court for having fired him after a "racist" text
A New York New York nephew pursues a couple in court for discriminatory dismissal after receiving an error message from the mother who complained that she was "a black one more."
The couple refuses to be racist, and assimilates prosecutions to "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed his dismay at the fact in 2016 that Giselle Maurice, the new Noonou, was Black when she arrived for her first day of work.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOON ENCORE A NOIR," wrote Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in an SMS.
Yet instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Mrs. Maurice.
According to the New York Post, after understanding his gaff, "uneased," Plasco-Flaxman sent Ms. Maurice, explaining to him that their former nephew, who was African-American, had done a bad job and that she was expecting rather a Filipino.
Maurice was paid for a day's work, then returned to her home by a Uber.
Now, Maurice is pursuing the couple in court to obtain compensation for her return and claims a $350 per day allowance for the six-month home service for which she was initially hired, but without a contract.
"I want to make them understand, listen, we don't do that sort of thing," she explained at the Post Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple responded to allegations of racism by saying that it was reasonable to end Maurice's employment, fearing that he would not trust him after he had done something wrong.
"My wife sent him something she didn't mean to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racists," Joel Plasco said at the Post.
"But would you entrust your children to someone with whom you were imposed, even if it was by mistake?
Your new baby?
Let's see!"
Similaring the trial to an "extortion," Plasco said that his wife was only two months old to have a baby and was in a "very delicate situation".
"Would you pursue someone like that?
It's not a very nice thing to do," added the business banker.
While the case is still in progress, the public opinion court has not hesitated to denounce the couple on social media, but blames them for their behaviour and logic.
Paddington publishers feared that readers would not identify themselves to a talking bear, reveal a new letter
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, born shortly after the book was accepted, said about this letter: "It is difficult to put herself in the place of someone who reads it for the first time before its publication.
It's very funny, knowing what we know about Paddington's huge success."
She stated that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before writing the book for children inspired by a small teddy bear, would remain optimistic about the rejection of his work. She added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books had had a "sweet-adult" flavor after his death last year.
She described Paddington as a "very important member of our family," and added that her father was very proud of her final success.
"He was quite a calm man, and he wasn't a pretentious man," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who did something: we are proud of him, even though it is not really his own accomplishment.
I think he saw Paddington's success this way.
Even though it is his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he has always attributed the merit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
At the landing, her daughter had been taken urgently to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried everything to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to explain how bad the situation was, we didn't expect it to get away with it," said Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then Nad called me to warn me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that the doctors had given him to maintain the heart rate were slowly dying out of his system.
She had died some time before and everything stopped.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing all this was happening.
I could neither scream nor cry, since I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold on to it."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperuse, mourning her daughter, rode on the plane with the other passengers, without worrying about the test she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I had my head down, and I cried all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it's during the flight that I experienced this immense sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women in mourning deposit postcards to prevent suicides on bridges.
Two women who have lost loved ones by suicide are trying to prevent others from dying.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys posted postcards on a Welsh bridge containing inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he started suffering from depression and committed suicide at 18 years of age.
"I don't want any parents to feel what I'm forced to feel every day," she said.
Ms. Davis, aged 45 and staying in Lydney, said that her son was a promising head with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said his smile lit up any room."
However, he left his job before he died, as he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then 11-year-old, found his brother after he committed suicide.
Ms. Davis said: "I constantly fear there is a training effect."
Ms. Davis created the cards "to let people know that there are people you can see and whom you can talk to, even if he is a friend.
Do not remain silent - you must speak. ”
Mrs. Humphreys, a long-time friend of Mrs. Davis, lost her partner, Mark for 15 years, shortly after her mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt depressed or depressed," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed his change of attitude.
He was at his lowest on Christmas Day - when the children opened their gifts, he had no visual contact with them or anything."
She said that her death had represented a tremendous trauma to them, but they had to get out of it: "It's tearing down for the family.
It destroys us.
But we all have to go ahead and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future was at stake as the FBI began its investigation.
"I thought that if we could get something like what he was asking for - a time-limited, limited investigation into his scope - we might be able to bring some unity," said Mr.Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee "would collapse" in a partisan impasse.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due to the choice of the moment.
The mid-term elections will only take place in five weeks, or on 6 November. If, as expected, Republicans make a bad score, they will seriously weaken in their attempts to elect the man they want at the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush pulled the phone to call the senators, asking them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and met, through him, his wife Ashley, who was his personal secretary at the time.
What will happen after the FBI has submitted its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
We still do not know if Mr.Kavanaugh can obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the Vice-President, to split the vote and confirm it before the Supreme Court.
North Korea: number of "fall" deserters under Kim's leadership
The number of North Korean deserters to South Korea has declined since the rise to power of Kim Jong-un seven years ago, declared a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Southern unification, stated that 1,127 desertions had taken place last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park stated that strengthening border controls between North Korea and China and increasing passenger charges were key factors.
Pyongyang has made no public comments.
The vast majority of deserters in the North will ultimately be granted South Korean nationality.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run away from China, which shares the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the very protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China regards deserters as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly returnees.
The relationship between the North and the South - which are still technically at war - has improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang in discussions focused on the denuclearization negotiations that had remained outstanding.
This took place after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, during which they agreed, in the main, to work for a nuclearized Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho imposed on US sanctions the lack of progress since then.
"In the absence of confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in such circumstances, it is excluded that we are the first to conduct unilateral disarmament," said Mr. Ri in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi qualifies Brett Kavanaugh as "hysterical" and asserts that he is unfit to sit in the Supreme Court
Pelosi, the leader of the parliamentary minority, called the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "hysteric" and stated that he was unfit to sit in the Supreme Court because of his temper.
Pelossi made these comments as part of an interview given on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I couldn't help but think that if a woman had behaved this way, they would have treated her as "hysterical," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Committee of the Judiciary last Thursday.
Kavanaugh has, with emotion, denied the allegations that he would have sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During her opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional and sometimes broke out screaming and choking with her family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the democrats sitting in the committee, calling him "grotesque and co-ordinated murder" organised by Liberals disappointed that Hilary Clinton lost the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi stated that Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he was unfit to sit in the Supreme Court, since he showed that he was against the Democrats.
"I think he disagrees with these statements and the way he has taken the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when he was asked whether she would try to remove Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and whether the Democrats obtained a majority in the House of Representatives.
"If he does not tell the truth at Congress or the FBI, he is not only unfit to sit in the Supreme Court, but is also unfit to sit in the current court," Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh is a judge at the DC Circuit Appeal Court.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about possible Kavanaugh's decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
During his confirmation hearings, Mr. Kavanaugh elucidated the question of the possible reversal of certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not the time for a hysterical and partial person to go to court and expect what we said: "it's not wonderful"," Pelosi said.
And women have to use it.
It's a legitimate diatribe, months and years of anger that overflow, and it can't get her out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," said Mrs Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think it's rare, do you?"
"I was greatly helped by a woman who was framed somewhere, who told me that she too cried when she was angry, but she developed a technique that allowed her to tell the person she was talking to, when she was angry and crying: "You can think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she went on.
And I found it brilliant."
The tears are allowed as an excuse to anger, partly because they are fundamentally incomprehensible.
One of my most striking memories of a first job, in an office dominated by men, where I once found myself crying out of an inexpressable rage, was to have been seized by the skin of the neck by an elderly woman - a cold director who had always been a little terrified - who trained me on a staircase.
"Don't let them see you cry" she said to me.
“They don’t know how furious you are.
They think you're sad and are delighted because they've had you."
Patricia Schroeder, then Democratic MP of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential elections.
In 1987, while Mr. Hart had been caught in an extra-conjugal case on board a boat called Monkey Business and had withdrawn from the campaign, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, said that there was no reason for her not to explore the idea of herself presenting herself to the presidency.
"It wasn't a very thoughtful decision," she told me with a laugh, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in law, and the last thing they missed was an extra person.
Someone had called it the "Black and the Seven Nains."
Since the campaign was very advanced, it had delayed the fundraising process, thus sworn that it would not participate unless it collected $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She learned that some of her supporters who usually gave $1,000 to men were only counting on $250.
"Do they think I'm entitled to a rebate?" she wondered.
When she announced in her speech that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so upset by her emotions - gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and target voters rather than delegates, and anger against sexism - that she was distracted by it.
"You would have thought that I was having a nervous breakdown," Mrs. Schroeder recalled about the press reaction to her.
"You would have thought Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember wondering what they were going to put on my tombstone.
"She cried"?
How trade war between the United States and China could benefit Beijing
The first rescues of the trade war between the United States and China were shocking, and although the battle was far from over, a disagreement between countries could benefit in Beijing in the long term, according to experts.
US President Donald Trump launched the first warning earlier this year by charging key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The biggest increase this week has occurred with new customs duties affecting items worth US$ 200 billion (£150 billion), thus charging half of all goods coming from China to the United States.
Every time, Beijing has been in-kind, striking customs duties from 5 to 10 per cent of US$60 billion.
China has committed itself to equalizing the United States, and it is unlikely that the second largest economies of the world will soon be over.
Backing Washington is yielding to demands, but giving up publicly in front of the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, China's president.
However, experts believe that if Beijing can play its role properly, the pressures of the U.S. trade war could have a positive effect on China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of both economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions conducive to economic slowdown in either country is in fact far more dangerous than what observers have previously recognized," said Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia, to the think group of the Center for New American Security.
Syria is "prepared" for the return of refugees, according to the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria declares itself ready for the voluntary return of refugees and seeks help to rebuild that country devastated by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moualem, stated that the situation in the country was improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
All conditions are now met for the voluntary repatriation of refugees to the country that they have been forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations believes that over 5.5 million Syrians have deserted the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome aid for the reconstruction of this devastated country.
He stressed, however, that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries sponsoring the insurrection.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup 2018 by beating the US team with a final score from 16.5 to 10.5 at the Golf National near Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe recovered the title when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team crossed the 14.5 points bar to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who was in trouble during most of the tournament, plunged his departure into the 16th hole in par-3, handing over his duel to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari has exceled in all its rounds, becoming one of the four players to have never reached 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament, the first edition of which dates back to 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was separated 5-4 by the least well-placed player of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen, from Denmark.
The world's best golfer, Dustin Johnson, leaned 2 and 1 against English Ian Poulter, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
Eight Ryder Cups Verteran, the Spanish Sergio Garcia has become the champion of Europe all the time with a total of 25.5 points of career.
"In general, I don't cry, but today it's stronger than I do.
It was a moving year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to get the cup back.
What matters is the team, and I'm happy to have been able to help him," Garcia was thrilled to learn about the European victory.
He passed the torch to his compatriot John Ram who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2-1 in simple, last Sunday.
"I feel an incredible pride, having beaten Tiger Woods, I grew up looking at this guy," Rahm said, 23.
Woods lost his four matches in France and now holds a record of 13-21-3 in career in Ryder Cup.
Surprising statistics for one of the biggest golfers of all time, who picked up 14 major titles, right behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had trouble all weekend finding the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
US captain Jim Furyk commented after a disappointing performance on his team: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning, we had a certain moment when we put pressure on Europe.
We've abandoned.
Hat to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
His 12 players all played very well.
We're going to get together, I'm going to work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and we're going to go ahead.
I love those guys and I'm proud to be a captain.
We need to bow down.
We've outgrown each other."
