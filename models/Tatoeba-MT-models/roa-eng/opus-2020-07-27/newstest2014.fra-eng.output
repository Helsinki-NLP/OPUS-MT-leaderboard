Spectacular jumps in "wingsuit" over Bogota
Sportsman Jhonathan Florez jumped on Thursday from a helicopter over Bogota, the Colombian capital.
Equipped with a winsuit (a combination with wings), it went to 160 km/h above the famous Monserrate sanctuary, located more than 3,000 meters high, where many badaduds had gathered to observe its operation.
A black box in your car?
While U.S. road network planners find it hard to find the money needed to repair the motorway infrastructure in decrepit, many are the ones that look for a solution in the form of a small black box that sets itself above the dashboard of your car.
The aircraft, which records all thousands of cars and transmits information to officials, are at the centre of a controversial attempt in Washington and in government planning offices to re-engineer the obsolete funding system on major U.S. roads.
The general lack of interest in the planning of the major axes has suddenly led to a highly animated debate and lively alliances.
The libertarians joined environmental groups to pressure the government to use the small boxes to keep track of the thousands you're going through, and possibly the road you're on, and then use the information to draft a tax bill.
The Tea Party is landed.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and expresses its concern about privacy.
And while the members of Congress fail to agree on whether to continue, several States have not waited.
They are looking for how, over the next decade, they will be able to switch to a system that allows drivers to pay according to the number of thousands of routes.
Thousands of motorists have already boarded these black boxes, sometimes equipped with a GPS monitoring system, for an experimental tour.
This is really essential for our nation.
"It's not like we had a choice," said Hasan Ikhrata, Director General of the Southern California Association of Governments, which provides for the state to start recording the thousands of journeys by every California motorist by 2025.
There will be a change in the way we pay these taxes.
The technology is here to do it.
The pressure stems from the fact that the country's Highway Trust Fund, which is funded by the taxes that Americans pay to the pump, is financially dry.
The Americans don't buy as much gasoline as they did before.
Cars can travel more than thousands with a gallon.
The federal tax itself, which is 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased for 20 years.
Political men are reluctant to increase the tax, even by 1 cent, while gasoline prices are high.
"The gas tax is simply not tenable," said Lee Munnich, a transportation policy specialist at the University of Minnesota.
His state has recently installed tracers on 500 cars to test a mile payment system.
"This turns out to be the most logical alternative in the long term," he said.
Wonks calls this a cost of use at the kilometre.
It is not surprising that the idea seduces the city's Liberals, since taxes could be used to change driving habits so as to reduce congestion and gas emissions, for example.
The planners in California are interested in the system as they develop strategies to achieve the objectives set out in the State's ambitious laws on climate warming.
But Mr. Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), Chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Transport, said that he also considered it the most viable alternative in the long term.
Free market supporters of the Reason Foundation also appreciate the idea of getting drivers to pay the mile.
"It's not just a tax getting stuck in a big black hole," said Adrian Moore, vice president of politics at the Reason Foundation.
People pay more directly for their benefits.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. secretaries to Transport who, in a 2011 report, urged Congress to go on the path of payment to miles.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year that would have covered approximately 10,000 cars.
But the Speaker of the Chamber killed the proposal, responding to the concerns of rural legislators representing voters who have to travel many thousands every day to go to work or to town.
Nevertheless, several States and large cities are making progress on their side.
The most determined is Oregon, which has mobilized 5,000 drivers to carry out the most important experience in the country.
These motorists will soon pay the State kilometric costs instead of gas taxes.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is considering one.
Illinois tries a test on a limited number of trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 agencies involved in road transport in States along the east coast of the United States (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) studies how it could implement change.
The concept is not a universal success.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer motorists recently equipped their car with a device, drivers were concerned that the government could follow their least facts and actions.
"An issue of Big Brother's concerns and this kind of thing is a big one," said Alauddin Khan, who directs the strategic management of performance in the Nevada Transportation department.
It's not something people want.
From the beginning of the trial, the Nevada ACLU warned on its site: "It would be relatively easy to transform these devices into entire localization devices."
There is no need to build a huge and cumbersome technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of people's daily journeys and arrivals.
Nevada is one of the few States that are now developing to find affordable technology that would allow the state to know how many thousands drive a car, but without knowing the place or the exact time.
If we can do this, Khan added, the citizens will be more comfortable.
The search for this technology has led some state agencies to use a small California startup called True Mileage.
Initially, the company was not intended to help motorists who paid taxes to States.
She sought to perch in the emerging car insurance market, in which drivers would pay on the basis of their mileage.
But the devices that it tests have been used by large-scale planners because they do not use GPS and provide a limited amount of information, periodically downloaded by modems.
"People will be more inclined to do this if you don't register and locate them," said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
Major mistakes have been made in the pilot programmes of some States.
There are much less expensive ways and methods that are much less intrusive.
In the Oregon, planners try the experience by offering different choices to car drivers.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
They can still choose not to have an apparatus at all, preferring instead to pay a package based on the average number of thousands travelled by all residents of the state.
Other States hope to sell the concept to suspicious citizens by allowing devices to do more, rather than enough.
In New York City, transportation managers are looking to develop a taxing device that would also be equipped to pay for parking fees, provide a "track payment" insurance and create a set of real-time speed data from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic jams.
"Cars would be encouraged to participate because of the benefits offered to them by the system," said a document on urban planning.
However, some transport planners wonder whether the whole debate on the payment to miles is not just a huge diversion.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission of the San Francisco Bay area, officials say that Congress could very simply manage the Highway Trust Fund bankruptcy by increasing fuel taxes.
An additional single or annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid vehicles and on others whose vehicles do not consume a lot of gasoline, so that each one pays his or her share.
"It is not necessary to resort to radical surgery when we just need aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, the director of legislation and public affairs to the commission.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of motorists will worry about protecting their privacy and a lot of other things.
David Bowie: Four Unpublished Listens · Global Voices
The English musician did not finish this year.
From The Next Day, published in January, he concocted a luxury edition scheduled for November 4th, with several unpublished.
Four have already emerged on the toilet.
Announcement of the release of a new album by David Bowie had left everyone on their shoes.
On the day of his 66th anniversary, on January 8, 2013, he stated that a new album would be released in March.
After ten years of silence (the last record, Reality, 2003) and too few appearances in public, the English musician proved that one could still count on him to spark the pop scene.
A party for his fans
No surprises, David Bowie had more than one round in his bag with The Next Day.
The Thin White Duke has thus planned to re-edit this album on 4 November.
For the occasion, he concocted a real party for his fans.
This edition, entitled The Next Day Extra, will be presented in the form of three discs: the original album, unpublished studio sessions and remixes, as well as a DVD containing the four previously unveiled clips.
The Next Day Extra will contain a total of ten additional tracks compared to the original album: the three songs of the Deluxe edition, five songs specially unveiled for the occasion, as well as two remixes.
David Bowie also made the presentations of this beautiful box in a video.
It introduces both the discs, but also the accessories provided with: exclusive photos and pockets, a notebook to share its own impressions, a booklet with the words...
And above all, he gives a foretaste of his new Atomic title, typically in the vein of The Next Day, with very forward guitars and a wisely mastered rock electricity.
Unpublished already listening
But Atomic is not the only title to reveal his charms.
The Informer, Like A Rocket Man, Born In A UFO are also available on canvas.
The Informer is double-faced: an intro worrying before a light ride that slows down gradually to leave room for a pop ballad.
On Like A Rocket Man, did Bowie want to make a little reference to Elton John's Rocket Man, even to Gravity?
With this title played, the singer seems in any case in his element when he no longer has his feet on earth.
Space Oddity, next door, was much more serious.
On Born In A UFO, David Bowie once again refers to his strangeness: would it come from another planet?
Guitar riffs, intoxicating, give the urge to leave the Earth.
Bowie finally had fun playing the chameleon with these titles: turn informer, man aboard a rocket, potential Marchan...
He hides and reveals at the same time, plays to adopt different personalities, as he did throughout his career, especially with his characters Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.
Nothing surprising, therefore, that he has a mask in his hand in the photography of the campaign The Travel Invitation, by the Louis Vuitton brand, in which he embodys the new face.
It will appear in one of their advertising spots, broadcast as of 10 November.
Defence Minister Rob Nicholson insisted that wounded soldiers were not summarily released from the Canadian Armed Forces, and stressed that a transition process was followed by all soldiers before their return to civilian life.
Attacked by Liberals and Neo-Democrats in the House of Commons, Mr Nicholson assured that before their release, members of the army were following a transition plan in collaboration with their superiors.
All wounded soldiers receive appropriate care for their return to civil life, and none of them are released before they are ready, he said.
Detractors accuse the government of wanting to save money by not allowing wounded soldiers - who do not respond to the army's "university of service" rule requiring staff to be able to perform a variety of tasks - to reach the 10-year eligibility period required for retirement benefits.
In particular, they cited two cases reported by La Presse Canadienne, including that of a soldier released last Friday.
Corporal David Hawkins, a reservist from London, Ontario with post-traumatic stress syndrome, was released from the army despite his request to stay for another year in order to be able to receive a fully indexed retirement.
His case came after that of Corporal Glen Kirkland, who declared before a parliamentary committee last month that he had been pushed to the exit before being ready because he did not respond to the rule of universality of service.
Mr. Hawkins stressed that a soldier could be prepared from, with plans and consultation sessions, but that this was totally different than wanting to leave ranks.
"I told them I wasn't ready," he said during an interview with The Canadian Press Wednesday.
I asked for months if there was a way for me to stay, and they said no.
Since the start of major fighting in Afghanistan, the army has been unable to determine what latitude it can give to wounded soldiers who want to remain in ranks but are not capable of fighting.
Under the current rules, soldiers severely injured have been recovering for up to three years.
If they do not meet the criteria for deployment abroad, they may be forced to leave the army.
Data presented last year in Parliament indicate that among the 1218 soldiers released for medical reasons, 199 had not reached the required length of service to obtain retirement benefits.
The Liberal spokesperson for former fighters, Jim Karygiannis, asked Wednesday for the reintegration of Corporal Hawkins, while the neo-democrat Jack Harris called for the immediate end of "this shameful practice".
Disney put on the tablets to launch an animated series
The American media and entertainment group Disney decided to prefer tablets to its own television channels for the next release of a new series for children.
The first nine episodes of Sheriff Callie's Wild West will be available from November 24 on the watchdisneyjunior.com site or via its app for phones and tablets.
Its global launch on Disney Group channels is only planned in 2014, detailing the release of its Disney Junior Division.
The animated drawing, intended for children aged 2 to 7, tells the adventures of Catte Callie, sheriff of a city in the west of America where she makes the order reign with a magical lasso.
Each episode includes two 11-minute stories.
"Interacting with smartphones and tablets is a second nature for children today," commented Albert Cheng, vice president in charge of digital products at Disney/ABC Television Group, quoted in the press release.
This type of experience is part of Disney's efforts to "widen the life span of its series and build new relationships with its public through increasingly important digital platforms," he added.
A first week poll published by Common Sense Media showed an explosion in the use of mobile devices by young children in the United States: 38% of children under 2 years of age have already used a tablet or a phone, and 72% of those under 8 years of age, compared to 10% and 38% two years ago, respectively.
Snowden is ready to "cooperate" with Germany on the issue of US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the U.S. intelligence officer, stated that he was willing to go to Berlin to testify to the German parliament if the United States National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander did not provide answers on their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met with Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was entitled to asylum, to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter to the media in Berlin on Friday, Mr. Snowden said: "Although the result of my efforts has been clearly positive, my government continues to treat the difference of opinion as a leak and seeks to penalize the political speech with accusations that it is impossible to defend itself."
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden wrote that he believed that the support of the international community could persuade the U.S. government to abandon the criminal charges against him.
As part of the complaint filed by the U.S. Department of Justice, he is charged with espionage and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, Minister of the German Interior, told Zeit Online: "If Mr. Snowden is ready to speak to German officials, we will make this possible."
The relationship between the United States and Germany has been severely challenged following complaints that the NSA has been listening to the mobile phone of the German chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the deputy head of the parliamentary group overseeing foreign secret services, said that if there was a chance to hear Mr. Snowden as a witness "without jeopardizing him and completely destroying relations with the United States," he needed to take advantage of.
Mr Ströbele, Member of Parliament Vert German, published a photo of him with Mr Snowden on his Twitter account.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Ströbele said that, according to the counsel of the former NSA consultant, Mr. Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Mr Snowden testified in Germany, he should be assured that he would be "safe" there, the Member said.
Mr. Snowden wrote in his letter that he had been subjected to a "severe and sustained" persecution campaign that had forced him to leave his country.
However, he said that he was encouraged by the global response to "my act of political expression".
Citizens around the world, as well as senior officials – including in the United States – found that the revelation of an inexplicable system of permanent surveillance was of public use.
The letter puts forward an offer of cooperation with the German authorities "when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved".
Cogeco Cable could soon offer interactive TV
Cogeco Cable subscribers may well have access to apps like Facebook, Twitter and ultimately the video service on request Netflix via their TV in a future that does not seem so far away.
Cogeco's subsidiary said Thursday it was currently conducting preliminary tests of the beta version of this platform with some of its users.
"This will enable us to develop more user-friendly interfaces as well as more options," explained Cogeco's president and head of management, Louis Audet, in an interview.
Cogeco Cable is thus misleading its competitors, like Bell, even though the subsidiary of Cogeco has not yet had a specific date with regard to this new platform.
"It is necessary to adapt and change or resist change and fail," said Audet.
The ultimate goal remains to provide tools that our customers do not currently have access to.
The Rogers telecommunications giant has already indicated that he could offer Netflix if some technical details, which were not cited, could be resolved.
In the United States, the popular video service says to be in discussions with some major cable distributors to make its service available through their broadcasting platforms.
Cogeco and Cogeco Cable also welcomed the announcement by the Harper government during its Speech from the Throne on 16 October last.
Ottawa wishes to force cable and satellite television providers to offer customers the opportunity to pay on-line services.
"It's been about two-and-a-half years since we say that the idea of forcing consumers to buy important chain packages is not working," said Mr. Audet.
However, he hoped that the consultations of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) would result in interesting recommendations.
"There will be a need to emerge from these discussions a kind of new frame of reference to define our new Canadian cultural policy with regard to television," Cogeco said.
The CRTC has been conducting consultations with the public since last week and is expected to continue with industry next spring.
On the side of the results, Cogeco reported having recorded a net profit of 43.8 million in the fourth quarter, or 82 ¢ per share.
This is a downturn compared to the net profit of 44.9 million, or 83 ¢ per share, of the same period last year.
The company established in Montreal explains this decline by depreciation costs related to new acquisitions.
Cogeco acquired the Atlantic Broadband cable from the United States in 2012.
This was the first major acquisition of the company after the one that had failed in Portugal.
Last December, the Montreal company also purchased Peer 1 Network Enterprises, an Internet provider established in Vancouver, totalling 526 million.
As for Cogeco's revenues, they experienced a growth of 41.5% in the fourth quarter to reach 504.7 million.
They are 1.8 billion for the current financial year.
The net profit of its main subsidiary, Cogeco Cable, was 43.9 million, or 90 ¢ per share, in decline compared to 45.7 million, or 93 ¢ per share, of the same period last year.
However, Cogeco Cable revenues increased by 45% to 470.4 million.
The company lost 15,237 customers during the fourth quarter.
However, for the financial year 2013, the number of Cogeco Cable customers is rising 5546.
Mr. Audet did not worry about seeing the number of customers fluctuating like that.
For me, it's not the indication of a change in trend, did he notice.
It varies from quarter to quarter with very strong competition.
From horse to beef products
Horse meat has been picked in beef-based canned cans, sold by two small British low-priced distributors, today announced the food hygiene agency.
Routine tests revealed that the products, developed in January in Romania and sold by the chains Home Bargains and Quality Save, contained horse DNA at 1 to 5%.
"As horse meat is not listed in the list of ingredients, it should not have been present in the product," the British agency explained.
A scandal over the presence of horsemeat in cooked dishes broke out in Europe at the beginning of the year, following tests in Ireland.
According to European Commission reviews, France was the country most affected by the presence of this type of meat in products intended to contain only beef.
A collision between two vehicles injured four earlier Friday on Route 131 in Lanaudière.
Shortly before 4h, a motorist who was driving north, in Saint-Félix-de-Valois, lost control of his vehicle and struck a car that arrived in the other direction.
The four occupants of the two vehicles were injured, but they were not afraid for their lives.
The traffic was back to normal around 6:00 p.m. on Friday.
Border Airlines plans to have baggage paid by hand
Border Airlines plans to pay up to $100 to passengers carrying hand luggage on their flights.
Border Airlines is planning to begin paying up to $100 for a hand luggage and $2 for a coffee or soda, although in her announcement Wednesday, she indicated that passengers could take the unopened cane with them down the plane.
The new hand luggage charges relate to bags stored in the upper compartment, so small bags installed under the seat will always be free of charge.
Border stated that it would pay $25 if the charges were paid in advance and $100 if the passengers paid only once at the boarding door.
The Border Spokesperson, Kate O'Malley indicated that the $100 was planned to encourage travellers to pay the costs in advance.
"We don't want to get this price paid," she explained.
The airlines began to pay for the first and second baggage recorded in 2008.
The passengers who tried to avoid these costs put as many things as they could in the baggage arranged in the upper compartments, so often there was no room in those compartments.
These costs are a way to ensure that passengers carry fewer things on board.
O'Malley said that these new fees will not really be used to collect money.
It is a matter of making border clients more loyal that it becomes increasingly difficult to find a place in the upper compartments.
Passengers who buy their ticket on the airline's website will not have to pay.
Thus, a passenger tailing at a Border boarding door could carry a bag for free, while the next person in the tail might have to pay $100 for a similar bag.
O'Malley explained that the Border site and registration procedures are changing to ensure that passengers know the existence of these costs before arriving at the door.
Border hand luggage costs will not be applied before summer, although no date has been set.
Passengers often complain about luggage and other expenses, but airlines love them.
They believe that baggage handling costs are important and that passengers who want the service should pay for it.
Many people at Wall Street consider the addition of luggage costs as a sign that proves that airlines pay enough to cover the cost of the air travel after years of loss.
However, many of them did not pay for luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. applied the first hand luggage charges three years ago, and the low-cost company Allegiant followed a little later.
The only other company that imposes such charges is the Hungarian company Wizz Air, declared the consultant to Jay Sorensen airlines, which follows the surcharge fee closely.
In a December 2011 report, he estimated that Spirit's hand luggage costs were $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines executive, recently travelled to Spirit and wondered what he was going to find at the boarding gate when passengers would discover the company's unusual hand luggage costs.
"I've never seen such a smooth boarding procedure of all my career," he said.
I was expecting to see toothbrushes and a fight popping at the door.
The plane was full, he added, "the passengers are mounted on board at lightning speed."
Border also acts as a Spirit and applies $2 for coffee, tea, soda or fruit juice.
Border indicated that passengers who take a soda or fruit juice can take the unopened cane with them, and those who take coffee can be preserved free of charge.
It will always distribute water for free.
US Airways briefly tried to pay for the drinks in 2008 but returned seven months later after the passengers complained and while no other major airline had followed.
Frontier's decision to pay for hand luggage costs when passengers don't buy their ticket directly from the airline is its last effort to encourage customers to go to its website.
Airlines pay online travel sellers such as Orbitz $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This encouraged all airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly from them rather than to contact an online travel agency.
However, Frontier has gone further in this area.
In September, it began to offer only half a thousand loyalty to customers who bought their ticket via an online travel agency.
Wednesday, it reduced the premiums by a 25% on a trip.
For example, a 1,000-mile border trip purchased from an online travel agency would make it possible to win 250-mile.
It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy their ticket directly on the Border site.
Border has a faithful clientele in its home city, Denver, but its activity retreats and it loses money.
The revenues fell by 9% and its flight capacity decreased by almost 13% in the first quarter, according to the financial results published on Wednesday by its parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
The Republic attempted to restore Border's finances by selling the airline.
The NSA calls into question an "internal error" rather than computer hackers for the failure of its site
The National Security Agency operating in the shadow said Friday it was a bug that had caused the loss of its public website for a few hours, not hackers like some had claimed it online.
"NSA.gov remained inaccessible for a few hours this evening because of an internal error that took place during a scheduled update," the spying agency said in an email statement.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The allegations that the failure was due to a distributed denial of service [SDS] attack are false.
Earlier this evening, online server trackers noted that the NSA site had been missing for at least 6 hours, and some users still cannot access the site.
Earlier, an NSA spokesperson told ABC News that the Agency's sensitive internal network was "not at all" compromised.
No classified information is in danger, explained the spokesman.
At least one group of online hackers claimed to be responsible for the failure of the NSA site through a DSD attack.
DSD attacks aim to flood a targeted site until servers are overloaded and the site collapses.
Cyber-tactical is not highly sophisticated and attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal network of the targeted system.
The NSA was once extremely secret, once known as the "No Such Agency", was under the fire of the projectors and strongly criticised in recent months following a wave of revelations about its extensive communications monitoring programs at the national and abroad – which are part of the NSA's secret files stolen from the agency and disclosed by the former unscathed consultant of the NSA, Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy around the agency caused many speculations that tonight's incident was the result of a targeted cyber-operation.
The Delta Centre-Ville now closed
The Delta Centre-Ville hotel closed its doors in Montreal Thursday, after 36 years of existence.
The investment fund that owned the building sold it to promoters who will transform it into student residences.
Three hundred and fifty people worked at the hotel.
Of these, 200 have not yet found a new job.
Delta promises not to drop his employees.
Employers came to meet employees directly on site, and individual employees met to assess their needs.
"This support will continue for the next six months," said the Regional Director of Labour Relations at the Delta Hotels, Felix Bisson.
The closing of the Delta comes in a very competitive hotel market.
The investment fund that owned this building had choices to make.
Either he reinvested in the building to continue to operate it, so there were investments of tens of millions while the competition is very fierce, there are many new hotels that appeared in Montreal.
"Or he sold it to someone else and that's what happened," explains Paul Arsenault, owner of the Transat Tourism Chair at the UQAM School of Science Management.
Other hotels in Montreal will also be converted in the coming months, such as the Crown Plaza that will become a residence for older people.
In the meantime, four hotel projects totaling nearly 600 rooms will see the day in two years.
For Titan's CEO, "Goodyear Amiens' purchase project starts with zero employee"
After having thrown the sponge with failure in January for the partial recovery of the Goodyear site of Amiens-North promised for closure, Maurice Taylor, the CEO of the American tyre Titan, declares today ready to save 333 jobs out of the 1 137 that counts the factory.
Arnaud Montebourg, Minister for Productive Recovery, had already announced it on Monday, October 21.
After giving up the project to buy the factory in January, you're back today.
You had spoken of violent attacks and insults, speaking of "so-called workers", who "work three hours" daily, of "fire" unions, targeting the CGT.
We don't understand that turn-face.
Is it to please Mr. Montebourg?
I'm not trying to please anyone.
Except my wife.
Mr. Montebourg is a charming young man trying to save industrial jobs among the best paid.
If I hurt someone by my words, I'm sorry.
But France also has a high level of tax and unemployment.
Does the truth hurt you?
Work seven hours a day when in other countries eight hours are disabled.
In India, China and in other countries, ten to 12 hours a day are worked.
But I don't have any prejudices about France.
What I see is a factory that manufactures good agricultural tires, has good equipment, is well located and has spaces to expand.
Why does Titan need this factory so much?
Titan doesn't need to buy this factory.
But with a fair price and competent workers, it is worth a try.
What kind of agreement do you expect between the CGT and Goodyear?
If, since the announcement of the closure of the factory, Goodyear had offered employees a good starting allowance, I think 100% of the employees would have accepted it.
Now let's imagine that Titan is buying Goodyear the factory closed.
Therefore, Titan could move the machines to Poland or any other EU country that still has its own currency.
I think Mr. Montebourg knows that.
But he wants to keep the Amiens factory with at least 333 well-paid jobs.
Titan agrees to recruit them among the approximately 1,200 current employees of Goodyear.
So Mr. Montebourg needs a commitment from Titan before trying to get the CGT to sit at the table with Goodyear.
The first step is that the CGT and Goodyear seal an agreement on starting allowances for all employees.
As a result, there will be no employees in the factory.
Mr. Montebourg said that you were ready to guarantee these 333 jobs for four years.
Do you confirm?
The only number I mentioned to the Minister is 333.
I know he'd want a four-year warranty.
But, as I told you, the CGT and Goodyear must first agree on starting allowances.
If all employees accept them, the project to purchase the plant starts with zero employees.
How can we provide employment time guarantees when there are no more employees left on the site?
If Mr. Montebourg manages to get CGT and Goodyear to agree and Titan buys the factory, we intend to stay in Amiens-Nord for more than four years.
Bombardier's profit is down, while aircraft deliveries and orders are down.
Bombardier Inc, Canadian aircraft and rail manufacturer, reported a 15% drop in profit net Thursday, under the pressure of a decrease in orders and delivery of aircraft during the third quarter and contractual problems in its Trains division.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not provide flight trial data for his new CSeries aircraft nor information to determine whether the aircraft would comply with its ambitious schedule of commercial deployment by September next.
After the inaugural flight of the test aircraft about a month and a half ago, the pilot stole only three times, and the question then asked whether the test phase was in the right direction.
The results were not in line with the forecast and the share rate dropped by 8% in the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at the National Bank Financial, lowered his rating on Thursday, from "surveillance" to "sector performance" due to the low potential increase in the scholarship in the next quarter or in the next two quarters.
"Although the decline in aircraft deliveries has been largely anticipated, we are really disappointed by the profit margin in the Transport Division," Cameron Doerksen said in a customer note.
We believe Bombardier will register new orders for its CSeries aircraft as the flight test program moves forward.
However, if no new order is announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more sceptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft family will be able to catapult it into the lower segment of a market today dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delay.
But the number of firm controls for CSeries aircraft has been modest so far to 177. It seems that potential buyers are waiting for the results of the on-flight tests to validate the company's claims regarding the energy efficiency and the potential for savings of the new airline.
Currently, the company has registered a total of 403 orders and purchase commitments from 15 customers and operators.
Pierre Beaudoin, President and Chief Executive Officer, is convinced that Bombardier will achieve its objective of 300 firm orders prior to the commercial operation of the first aircraft.
The leaders also reassured analysts and the media on Thursday that the program was progressing in accordance with the timetable.
"The test aircraft did not remain on the ground longer than expected," said Beaudoin at a telephone conference, adding that ground tests and software updates were planned during the aircraft's stopping time.
Each manufacturer plans differently.
We decided to take a first flight and provide for an update period, and that is what we did.
This will be repeated throughout the flight program.
The second of the five test aircraft is expected to fly in the coming weeks, the others will follow shortly thereafter, said the company.
However, analysts are skeptical about the fact that the first customer can fly a CSeries plane only 12 months after his inaugural flight.
Bombardier indicated that it was evaluating the schedule of entry into service and will provide new information in the coming months.
"This slow test in flight – although apparently in line with Bombardier's internal schedule – reinforces our view that entry into service will be postponed in the first quarter of 2015," said Doerksen.
In the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, compared to $172 million, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier.
The adjusted action result remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Income dropped slightly from $4.2 to $4.1 million.
Analysts expected 10 cents per share and revenues of $4.56 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth aircraft manufacturer indicated that he had delivered 45 aircraft in the quarter, compared to 57 a year earlier.
Net controls fell to 26 planes, compared to 83 earlier.
The delay in the Aeronautical Division was $32.9 million at September 30, which was unchanged from December 31 of the previous year.
"In Aeronautics, the results were consistent with our forecasts, but the low number of orders and general market conditions were disappointing," said Beaudoin.
Aeronautics revenues fell by 13 per cent to $2 million.
Bombardier, the world's largest railway manufacturer, said that the revenues of this division had increased by nearly 11 per cent to $2.1 million.
The Transport Division's order book amounted to $32.6 million as of September 30, a slight increase compared to December 31 of the previous year.
The margins of the Transport Division have been affected by some major contracts.
The leaders announced that new indications would be provided during the fourth quarter.
Bombardier's share course, which also announced that Patrick Pichette, the Chief Financial Officer of Google Inc, would sit on the Board of Directors, fell from 8.5% to 4.83 Canadian dollars in the afternoon of Thursday.
Brazilian company Embraer SA, the third largest airline manufacturer in the world and the closest competitor to Bombardier, reported a 10% decrease in its quarterly profit on Thursday.
Two 23- and 27-year-old steleologists had been missing in a gouffre under the Dent de Crolles since Thursday evening, was learned Friday at the Speleo auda de l'Isère.
They were located this Friday afternoon.
The two men, one aguerri to the practice and the other not, had left in the ground Thursday around 9:30 p.m. to cross the Dent de Crolles, located in the town of Saint-Pierre-de-Chartreuse.
We had no news of them since then, specified the same source.
"Spelologists should have come out around 5:00 a.m.," said Thierry Larribe, Technical Adviser to the Speleo in charge of the relief organization.
Tens of people on site
Some twenty rescue workers, ten civilians members of the French Relief Speleo, as well as gendarmes, CRS and firefighters were on site.
At the end of the afternoon this Friday, the two steleologists were located.
"It is another group of surgeons who, after finding them exhausted but healthy in the cavity, transmitted the information to one of the relief teams engaged in the network," explains Le Dauphine.
The two soldiers at the 13th Battalion of the Chambéry Alps were found "exhausted, but not wounded".
They lost in the network, returned to their steps in waiting for relief, said the prefecture.
Powered, they should emerge from the cavity with the help of the rescuers in the evening.
German journalists invited to escape Google and Yahoo
The German journalists' union invited its members to stop using Google and Yahoo online services on Thursday following further revelations on the activities of the United States and British intelligence services.
"The German Federation of Journalists recommends that journalists avoid even further use of Google and Yahoo search engines and messaging," she said in a press release.
She considers the information from the Washington Post "candalous", according to which the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) and the British Government Communications Headsquaters (GCHQ) collected mass information by infiltrating international networks that allow both companies to synchronize their servers.
"The research carried out by journalists is as confidential as the coordinates of their sources and the nature of their communications with them," added Michael Konken, president of the union claiming 38,000 members.
Receipts: a Member of Parliament is applying for the resignation of Brigitte Gruutels
The project of Minister Brigitte Grueutels of "relifting" theposts of signaling lights in Brussels does not please everyone.
As a reminder, the Brussels Minister for Public Works and Transport launched this Thursday in the centre of Brussels a test project to capture 16 markers of signaling lights from the region in the yellow and blue colours of Brussels.
The goal being both "to increase security" and "the Brussels identity".
The idea is, in the long run, to recover all bruxellois signaling lights, at an estimated cost of about EUR 1 million.
But the blue chosen by the minister is "too dark", according to the Brussels MP Emmanuel De Bock, who speaks of "flamandization" of the capital and demands the "remission" of Brigitte Gruetels.
"Not content to spend the Bruxellois' money very much in the relifting operations of signaling poles in the colours of the Brussels Region, Brigitte Gruouels continues his Flemishing operations of the Capital," Mr. De Bock emerges in a statement.
After her yellow-mangue-black taxis, she finally recaptured herself in dark blue-yellow yellow-yellow the poles of Brussels.
According to the Member of Parliament, there is now "more difference in visual continuity between Flanders and Brussels".
The Bruxellois deserve better than seeing their money wasted by a CD&V minister who itself realizes the NVA program.
It is high time to stop the horse of Troy de la Flandre.
"To remember, Brigitte Gruetels was elected only with 2,245 votes or 0.5% of the Brusselsers!" said De Bock.
the portico of Pont-de-Buis detached
The ecotax portico of Pont-de-Buis, around which a violent manifestation of opponents to this tax took place on Saturday morning, was demolished.
The cranes arrived on site shortly after 10 hours, and the traffic on the national was diverted to the fence.
The decision to decommission, announced by the Finistère prefecture on Wednesday, was taken by the company Ecomouv, portico manager.
The latter is the last of the three eco-taxed ports in the department of Finistère, the other two having been dismantled or sabotaged.
Launch of a accessories store for Google Glass
An online shop, offering multiple accessories dedicated to Google Glass, has just been made available to thousands of developers with a prototype of Google signed connected glasses.
In this way they can acquire an listener, a shipper or even a storage case.
This shop, strictly reserved for developers already with Google Glass, offers some accessories such as a charger and its USB cable, for $50.
For the same price, it is also possible to acquire a protective cover made of micro-fibre or an intra-atrial earring.
Although Google is currently working on a Google Glass model with correction glasses, no large-scale marketing dates have yet to be confirmed.
Five years ago, my father disappeared from the world of the living.
At first I denied his death, I was talking about him now,
I was so afraid to forget it, or rather I didn't know how I was going to keep him "frequent."
There is no recipe, no method of employment to pass the wall of the invisible and find his own.
Then there were signs.
The first time it was the very strong feeling of his presence at the passenger seat while I was driving.
Another time, a gentle awakening in the middle of the night to watch his watch that doesn't leave me, laid on the night table.
It is the image of my smiling father that accompanies me in my everyday actions.
Our mother left us after her exhausting fight against cancer.
At least that's what I thought on the day I found her body empty, squeezed on this hospital bed with rubbed sheets.
Likewise, his funerals were a glacial farewell focused around the lean glow of candles that would encircle his coffin.
I thought she was gone.
Little by little, by small day or night apparitions, a little shy, a little faded, it quickly came back into my mind, evolving as it regained its place in the landscape of my thought that was mourning.
And then, she revealed herself to me while revealing my own facets that I had not yet noticed, masked by my relationship with her.
So I learned and understood that I had never lost my mother's person but just a woman I didn't really know, a woman who incarnated that person during her life.
By dying, this woman had perfect her life and freed the person I loved, and here I found her, full and complete.
This distance from the path of my life remains the most unexpected and most beautiful.
It is a privilege to know that loved ones never leave us.
I look like my father, "in and out" he seemed.
I've always been told.
I never believed it at the time.
I had difficult relationships with him until he got old, sick.
There, I was no longer afraid of him, and I could love him.
One day he died.
For a long time, he accompanied me: when I stopped smoking, when I was scared, when I got sick...
He talked to me, he constantly encouraged me, he lived my body.
I saw his hands watching my hands, I lent my body to him.
But it was never indiscreet.
I could have a personal life.
He would leave me alone.
It lasted a long time and then one day he left.
Finally, it was comfortable and reassuring to be understood, encouraged, advised.
I no longer know who said that the deceased are not forgotten but invisible.
My parents are no longer, but I feel them constantly close to me.
Every event, every moment of my life makes me feel their presence because I still mean it: what would they have said ? what would they have thought ? what would they have done ?
I constantly dream of them, maybe not every night, but several times a week it's certain.
I often dream of the last moments that I have to share with them before it's too late, only there's always something that keeps me from doing this.
I often wake up anxious when it happens to me and deeply feel their absence.
Sometimes, some dreams lead to me on the contrary and to my story and actually, they continue to live and share my life.
On the eve of my ultrasound where I had to know my baby's sex, I dreamed that I was waking up, I was getting out of bed, my father was waiting for me on the floor and he smiled at me and he rejoiced that I was expecting a little boy.
The next day, I had the feeling that he had visited me in my sleep to mean that he was happy to share what happened to me.
And of course, he was a little boy in my belly.
I loved to share this moment with him and I enjoy telling you this common memory after his death.
Five years ago, my grandmother died as a result of cancer.
A year ago, she was on a trip with my family in Cuba.
That is to say the shock that his disappearance caused the young bachelor I was at the time.
I still realized my mourning pretty quickly.
But it continues to influence my life, especially when I face difficulties, or when I have to make important decisions.
Learning Arabic and interested in the Middle East, to the point of mastering it in a large school, were not, with the decline, anodynous choices.
In fact, I often heard him speak Arabic in my childhood, and speak of Morocco, where she had lived for decades - before returning to France at the time of independence.
The values that she taught me are always present, so that I can think about how she would like me to act at some point.
It is the same for my attitudes: I try to live up to the generosity and rightness of the one who was a fervent believer.
Now I feel it as a daily presence, a benevolent soul, a saving spirit.
I see his eyes set on me.
My mother died nineteen years ago now.
He died after talking to me on the phone.
I've been through all phases: misunderstanding, anger, pain, crying alone, anywhere, whenever, in unusual places, unusual moments.
Then time calmed down the pain.
Only the lack, this void without response, this need for her, to entrust me, to reassure me to the depths of her gentleness.
Yet she is there, silent presence, she is there and looks at me.
Every morning, I see her anxious eyes set on me, I see the circles that swell her eyes, the wrinkles around the lips that dig the cigarettes, the folds that mark the front of the days of concern.
My mother took possession of my face and she looks at me every morning in my mirror.
And every morning, I turn my eyes away.
My wife and mother of my 3 children died from cancer at 43 years of age.
We always feel his protection, nothing serious can happen to us.
It was his promise on his bed of pain, so we gradually came back to smile, and pronouncing his name is no longer taboo but a comfort.
Of course, I speak to her in the dark of the night when the absence hurts too much, she invites herself in my dreams when morals are a little touched.
We feel carried and protected in difficult times, the delay of time makes us realize how much she was the conductor and we are trying to stay in the path that she had tracked us.
If a being loved you very much, the absence cannot take it from your heart and memories.
In a way, being loved becomes your inner energy.
I lost my father on August 22, 2008 as a result of asbestos cancer.
I was very close to him, I always acted according to what he thought or what he liked.
I couldn't attend his inhumanity and three weeks after his death, I gave birth to a little boy.
If I have my convictions sometimes different from his own, I still wonder if my actions are in line with his vision of things.
I have had problems in my work for these convictions.
For me, it's impossible to go in the opposite direction, I don't sleep and I still wonder what he's going to think.
I don't know if I've adopted his way of being or if I'm just like him: is that genetic?
In any case, it will always be my reference.
It was a bit like an alter-ego, there was no need to talk to each other.
In short, he's here every day.
I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
It was soon thirty years that my husband died at the age of 33.
I was 28 and our 6-year-old son.
The immense pain that invaded me then has of course diminished, but it is still close to me.
Very often he "arranges" in my dreams in such a precise way, so alive that at waking up I am even sadder to find that it was only a dream.
The other night, he asked me if I was going well, I said no, he answered me, "I went down" but with such a real voice that I woke up in distress, anguished and lit the hair lamp by looking everywhere, convinced that he was coming.
I always live in the same house, and often I feel observed and I go back to see if he's not there, I know it's him and I'm talking to him.
In every room I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
For nothing in the world I would not leave this house where we were happy and his spirit lives with me.
I'm 58 years old, I've always lived alone since he left, he is and will remain the love of my life.
I want to clarify that I am sociable with a responsible profession, I laugh and sing, I go out, I am grandmother, I am full of friends, but my heart and soul belong to him and I never talk about him except with my son, and I never go to the cemetery.
Iraq: October was the bloodiest month since 2008
October was the most deadly month since April 2008.
Baghdad published this Friday of the official figures: 964 people lost their lives last month: 855 civilians, 65 police officers and 44 soldiers.
This publication takes place on the day that the Iraqi Prime Minister is received by the President of the United States.
Noury al-Maliki wishes to help the United States.
"We don't say the world is on our side and we support ourselves, we have the right to ask the world because we're part of it," Al-Maliki said this Thursday in Washington.
And also because if what's going on in Iraq is not settled, it's going to expand, and what's going on in Syria is going to expand too.
And what happens when a terrorist virus lives? it spreads.
Noury al-Maliki spoke at the United States Institute for Peace, an independent institution created by Congress.
Outside the building, protesters protested against the Iraqi leader.
They branded banners for the accuser, among other things, of being a murderer and calling on the United States to refuse to provide him with help.
Cocaine lawyer who informed a drug sponsor of a police investigation was imprisoned
Basharat Ditta, 42 years old, gave information to the crime lord Neil Scarbrough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction would not be revealed on the big day.
He was sentenced to three years imprisonment by the Liverpool Seat Court
A senior defence attorney, who had informed a drug sponsor of a major police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug addiction would be revealed, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42 years old, provided sensitive information to the crime lord Neil Scarbrough about investigations into his drug trafficking activities after having been compromised due to his habit of consuming cocaine.
The lawyer, who was called "Bash" and considered by criminals to be a "first important case", was arrested at his home in 2011 following police listening operations directed to Scarborough, which he had represented in a previous trial in relation to drug trafficking.
Police officers found Sarborough, 32 years old, dropping three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was attending a Bar Association dinner with confreres.
Investigations revealed that Dita was a "regular consumer" of this class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in her hair, on her wallet and credit cards.
During an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he sought unlawfully to obtain information on the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his associates.
The four suspects were then monitored by the police as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire counties.
With 32 other men, they were subsequently imprisoned after the police seized heroin and cocaine for a sum of £1.5 million, as well as over £200,000 in cash during a series of raids.
Ditta, 42 years old, was providing information to criminals because he feared that his addiction would not be revealed at large.
Today, at Liverpool's seat court, Ditta, who works in the Forbes Solicitors lawyer's office in Blackburn, fell into disgrace after being convicted on two counts of criminal charges after a trial of three weeks.
He had admitted cocaine possession at a previous hearing.
The lawyer's fall occurred after the police investigating Scarborough found that he had been in regular contact with Dita in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and found him arriving at Ditta's home and placing drugs, pure to 60%, under the lawyer's trash in a black golf glove.
Shortly after the deposit, Scarborough was regularly in contact with Dita, who was at a dinner party at the Ewood Park football stadium, pregnant with Blackburn Rovers.
The lawyer returned home, discovered the drug, and called nine times.
The court heard that Dita was a "regular consumer" of cocaine after tests showed traces of this class A drug in her hair, on her wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested but refused to consume cocaine and said he had spoken to the drug dealer because he was his client and argued that their discussions were subject to a "legal privilege".
During his arrest, Ditta collected his wallet and tried to remove several credit cards, but they were all seized and a hair sample was taken from him.
In an interrogation, he stated that he owned an office at his home, as well as at his workplace, and that clients called him at his home for legal matters.
But the court heard testimony that he called for major actors in the drug trade, some of whom he had represented, after key arrests to tell them which investigators were aware.
Attorney Anne Whyte said: "If anyone should know that the law must not be violated, it is a criminal lawyer."
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer, and of becoming too involved with private clients.
The relationship we're talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who supplies drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his communications will undoubtedly be legitimate communications because he was his lawyer.
But this went well beyond the ordinary limits of a relationship between a lawyer and his client.
He obstructed the police investigation as much as he could to allow him to pursue his criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not honor his profession, but dishonored him.
He was too close to some customers, particularly Scarborough, and he let him compromise his independence.
Ditta denied any illegal action and said: "If I were a corrupt lawyer, what I am not, and if I wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited for 15 hours, I would have done it immediately."
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police said: "Mr. Ditta has become a criminal lawyer himself as soon as he has begun to procure drugs from criminal organizations."
His addiction to cocaine has compromised him forever and made him vulnerable to the background of the leaders of organized criminal groups who commissioned him to obtain valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers should observe the strictest rules of integrity and establish a climate of public confidence.
Ditta has betrayed that trust and tried to protect himself behind the paint of his profession.
Lancashire's grave and organized crime unit investigated Mr. Ditta, who was found guilty of the three counts of cocaine possession and now of a violation of justice, bearing in mind his commitment to prosecuting criminals in justice.
That this case serves as a warning to criminals so they know that no one is above the law.
We will find you and bring you before the courts.
Scarborough himself was imprisoned for 14 years after he pleaded guilty for complicity in heroin, cocaine and cannabis trafficking.
Thirty-five other persons involved in trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drug trafficking.
On his website, Ditta organized a question/answer session on himself in which he said that his dream job would be to be a lawyer to represent customers in the death row in America, his last guest to dinner would be Mohammed Ali and inequality would motivate him to work.
Aretha Franklin will be on stage in December
The newspaper Detroit News reports that the queen of the soul will take place on 21 December in the Sound Board room of the Hotel MotorCity Casino.
In November, Franklin started recording an album for Clive Davis and Sony Music, produced by Don Was and Kenny "Babyface" Edmonds.
Not to mention the disease she suffered, the famous performer of Respect had told the media on October 16 that the side effects of a treatment she received were "difficult".
She says she's "happy to be back."
Menton reduces the cost of its Christmas illuminations
420 motifs, 2.2 kilometers of seaboard covered with a light coat: the hot blow could be fluttered in Menton with the billing of the lights.
Invoice which, unlike many communes, is also settled by taxpayers, not by traders' associations.
To alleviate its costs, the city uses leds.
But also a differentiated management of the public lighting network and Christmas decorations.
Los Angeles Airport evacuated after a shooting
A gunfight took place at Los Angeles International Airport.
It was 10:00 a.m. Local time when a man opened the fire.
According to local police, there would be at least 2 injured.
This would be an employee working for the United States Transportation Safety Administration (STA) and the firefighter.
The incident would have occurred at Terminal 3, causing a wave of panic.
Travellers and staff made their way to the exits or the tarmac.
Soon the police forces intervened and a man suspected of being the shooter was apprehended on the roof of an airport parking lot.
The airport is being evacuated and air traffic is being interrupted.
Classic song for teens
Every time, it is the school clientele that will be targeted, an initiative that had been very successful during the previous season.
Through five tailors imagined and interpreted by artists from the region, cartoons with a high dose of humor, teenagers are allowed to learn the classical song.
In addition to this show, the Société d'art lyrique du Kingdom will return with its lyrical destinations, a formula that now serves as a hall for the Pulperie de Chicoutimi.
Two other concerts will take place in summer 2014, which gives artists in the region the chance to show what they are capable of.
To these activities was added the lyrical Apero, the concert-winner held last August, with the help of the soprano colorature Marie-Éve Munger.
It was a beneficial activity, parallel to the artistic dimension, and it helped the not-for-profit organization to produce a financial balance which is as soft in the ears as an air of La mau-muris.
Without providing precise figures, the chairman of the board, Yves Bergeron, took advantage of the press meeting held yesterday in Chicoutimi, to be reassuring.
Despite the precariousness that is the lot of so many cultural institutions, the future is well-designed, even in the long term.
We have stronger and more constant support.
"Finance is on the rise and we hope to last until the 50th anniversary of the operation, a step we will go through in seven years," said the administrator.
"I would even say beyond," added Director General Hélène Gaudreault, smiling.
The 37-year-old man who took a child hostage at Gabrielle Roy de Surrey School faces six counts, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
Omar Moustapha Hassan has been accused of hostage-taking, kidnapping, posing threats, carrying weapons in a dangerous design, kidnapping, and failure to comply with an order.
"The rapid reactions of the police involved and their ability to defuse the situation immediately were essential to the safe conclusion of this incident," said Corporal Bert Packet through communication.
Omar Hassan is still in detention and will have to appear in court on Friday.
New application for collective remedy against the Sainte-Croix brothers
A new application for collective redress was filed against the Sainte-Croix brothers, concerning sexual assaults that would have occurred this time in the St.Joseph oratorium, as well as in several orphanages, colleges and schools.
The request is based on the testimony of the petitioner, identified as "J. J.", who was reportedly masturbated in the 1950s, first at Notre-Dame-des-Neiges by his teacher, Brother Sumis, then by his confessor, Father Bernard, in the oratory Saint-Joseph, where he was serving Mass and where his father worked as a painter.
The first appeal was aimed at only three institutions, and when the regulation was announced, many people said to us: "I was in such a place, can I register?" says lawyer Alain Arsenault, who defends the victims in both appeals.
The collective remedy that has just been filed has the particularity of allowing the addition of complainants from any institution where abuse could have been perpetrated by members of the congregation of Sainte-Croix.
At present, the appeal brings together complaints of 25 persons who claim to have been assaulted by the Sainte-Croix brothers.
The alleged facts are generally older than those mentioned in the first appeal, as several of the institutions concerned closed their doors in the 1960s.
The appeal also stresses that the congregation of Saint-Croix and the oratory of Saint-Joseph, which is a separate entity, "have allowed sexual abuse to be perpetrated against children", that they "have exercised moral, religious and psychological constraints on the victims", that they were "aware of the sexual abuse perpetrated and nevertheless suffocated them", and that they have "scientificly and consciously chosen to ignore the problem".
These latter charges are based, among other things, on letters written by the lawyer of the Sainte-Croix brothers, Me Émile Perrin, in the 1990s, and also on the research done in the archives on this subject by Brother Wilson Kennedy, an old brother of Sainte-Croix who publicly denounced the abuses.
The collective remedy must first pass the admissibility stage in the Superior Court.
Once the admissibility has been accepted by the Court, the second stage is the hearings on the merits.
In the case of the first appeal, the Sainte-Croix congregation had agreed to settle amicably before hearings were held on the merits.
Important fire in a trade
A fire severely damaged a trade in the surroundings of LaSalle, in Montreal, on Thursday night to Friday.
The reliefs were called around 1am, Friday, due to a fire that had declared itself in the basement of an Indian cuisine restaurant on Dollard Avenue, near the intersection with Réjane Street.
The 30 firefighters who were sent to the premises put about an hour to control the brewery.
The fire "caused significant damage to the structure of the building," said the chief to the Montreal Fire Safety Service operations, Richard Bordeaux.
The cause of the fire was unknown, but there was no one in the restaurant when the firemen arrived on the scene.
There were no injuries, but almost twenty dwellings, located on the first and second floors of this row of commercial premises, had to be evacuated.
The Red Cross was requested, as residents of one of the apartments might need to be temporarily accommodated, the SIM indicated.
Many opposition to medical help to die in the Palliative Care Congress
The Canadian Palliative Care Congress, which takes place this week in Ottawa, occurs a few days after the vote in favour of the principle of the bill on medical aid to die in Quebec.
This is an opportunity for several palliative care associations to reaffirm their disagreement.
If all the sick had access to effective care to alleviate their suffering, in addition to being able to stay at home, very few of them would want to end their days, according to a spokesperson of the Canadian Palliative Care Association, Maryse Bouvette.
If the emphasis was placed on palliative care in Canada, the approach to euthanasia would be minimal.
The president of the Québec Palliative Care Network also rejects the bill on medical assistance to die.
If adopted, Alberte Déry is concerned about the consequences for the next generations.
"What is the meaning of life," she laments.
Most palliative care homes will refuse to help patients die, according to the vice president of the Palliative Care Houses Alliance, Suzanne Fitzback.
Ms. Fitzback, also director of the Mathieu-Froment-Savoie house in Gatineau, thought the service would be useless.
We are never asked, "I want to die, give me an injection."
The Director of the Ontario Palliative Care Association, Rick Firth, believes that the Quebec Bill disorients the population about the vocation of palliative care.
He doesn't think Ontario will screw up.
For her part, Gatineau's Liberal MP, Stéphanie Vallée, says that the notion of end of life must be clarified before the bill is passed.
Kenyan media is free of the controversial media law
"It is a scary country and it is legitimate to ask ourselves the following question: what will prevent Parliament from sweeping the independence of the judicial system tomorrow?" said the newspaper in challenging the bill and demanding that it be declared unconstitutional.
"This law is radical and very punitive, and we refuse it," explained Cyrus Kamau, General Manager of Capital Group – owner of CapitalFM, one of the most respected independent radio stations and Internet news sites in Kenya.
He said that the new media tribunal "will always be partial because it is a government extension" and that restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's place in the world economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this bill and send it back to the parliamentarians," he added.
According to The Star newspaper, the new bill will allow the government to have "hand over the media."The Standard said that democracy and freedom of opinion in Kenya "have been hit hard" and crushed the bill as "draconian".
The adoption of the bill also involves a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the wake of the attack by armed Islamists at the Westgate mall last September.
The Kenyan media aroused the authorities' anger by broadcasting images of video surveillance cameras on which troops deployed on the scene of the attack devoked so-called the luxury mall.
Police chief David Kimaiyo reacted by summoning two journalists and one media officer to interrogate them, although the call was withdrawn following a lifting of shields in the media.
Under the new bill, the media may be fines ranging from up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and journalists to up to 1 million with the additional risk of being "disbanded" or not being able to receive official press accreditation.
The court also has the power to seize the property of an offender if the offender has not paid his fine.
According to the Daily Nation, "even one fine is sufficient to paralyze most FM stations."
He also said that measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as Kenya's "animated blogosphere".
By reducing the media to silence, politicians know that they can do what they want with impunity.
"No one will ever know," wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist in The Nation, describing Kenyan media as a key source of control in public life.
"Delivered to themselves, politicians would bankrupt the country and bring us back to hunting and harvesting."
Kenyan legislators were the target of population anger in the past.
In May, they took a stand against the cuts ordered by the National Commission in charge of wages and restored their mirobolous wages of about 532,000 shillings per exempt month of tax – which are among the highest in the world.
A difficult year for pharmacists
The departure of nearly 10 pharmacists from Laval's Health and Social Services Centre (CSSS) has caused a great deal of emotion to the management of the Cité-de-la-Health Hospital in 2012-2013.
Due to multiple retirements, maternity leave or short leave, the department of pharmacy found itself highly deficient in staff.
Almost 30% of the required staff were missing, making this financial year "very difficult", according to department leader Gillian Beaudet.
However, the CSSS has decided not to engage independently, which can cost up to three times as much as a full-time hired pharmacist.
We did not resort to troubleshooting, said Mrs. Beaudet.
We have streamlined or reduced some of our activities within the flooring facility, the time that things are changing.
It is certain that we have worked hard to interest our young people [pharmacies residents] in order for them to come and stay here.
There's a background competition that made us in a bad situation last year.
Improved situation
After this difficult period, the year 2013-2014 announces significantly easier for the department of pharmacy of CSSS.
Already, three pharmacists have returned to work after their maternity leave and three other pharmacists have been hired in the past few months.
In addition, the Department's efforts to retain fruit were successful, as the four students currently in residence in Laval also decided to remain in employment of the CSSS.
Now, it's going a lot better, said the pharmacist.
By the end of the fiscal year, we will have seven new pharmacists and three maternity returns.
So this will fill our departures from last year.
Always Growing Needs
However, the situation remains delicate.
Several factors, such as the shortage of hospital pharmacies or a predominance of young women in the profession, make situations such as that experienced in 2012 difficult to predict.
For us [the number of staff] is always precarious, because we have an environment that is young and we employ a lot of young women, so with pregnancy, we almost always ride three maternity leave when it's okay, did it add.
Last year, we had a lot more and we don't have any pharmacists that are available to make replacements, so it was more difficult.
The top model of 22 years doesn't begin his career in cinema by the small door.
The director Lars von Trier chose it to incarnate Charlotte Gainsbourg young in Nymphomaniac, his next film.
This egreous porn drama, in eight chapters that will emerge in two strands (January 1 and 8, 2014), the erotic memories of a quadragener increase sex since his adolescence.
Stacy Martin's resemblance to his eldest is striking: a brindille silhouette, a diaphane dye and French-English origins.
Not to forget a certain taste of the risk: the one who had not hesitated to lay naked on ice paper will show up in situations far more sulfurous on the large screen.
An extract from Nymphomaniac raised the temperature on the Toilet: Stacy Martin appears in bed and in full ecstasy with Shia LaBeouf.
If the provocative filmmaker asked his actors to put their stink on the closet, he used X professionals for the most dare sex scenes, before merging all the bodies numerically: above the belt, it is the star; below, the lining.
From Björk to Charlotte Gainsbourg, passing through Nicole Kidman, Lars von Trier has the habit of pushing her actresses into their last hangovers, always for the best.
Stacy Martin hasn't finished talking about her.
A room of the Narbonne CGR evacuated Thursday night
On Thursday evening, the first session of a film was interrupted at the Mega CGR of Narbonne, as a precaution, as a result of tipping at the throat felt by the spectators.
Immediately, the director of the facility had the room evacuated and warned the firefighters about a suspicious smell.
About 70 people left the meeting.
People were examined and there was no full recognition of the room.
Bad joke on the bottom of tear jet?
Or an involuntary incident?
Is it always that the direction of the cinema has played the precautionary principle and the safety of its customers in the background?
The room was aired and everything went into order.
The cinema has been able to regain its rights and customers find the pleasure of the images.
On screen only.
She tries to import 2 kg of cocaine into citrus fruit
Taking advantage of Halloween day, a woman tried to get two kilos of cocaine hidden in the country in citrus fruit on Thursday morning at Montreal-Trudeau Airport.
It was during the examination of passenger baggage that the drug could be detected.
Cocaine had been distributed into three pre-emptive citrus fruits.
The drug was then transported to the office of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCG) who took the relay in this investigation.
The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) did not reveal where women came from when intercepted.
This is part of the investigation, said Jacqueline Roby, CBSA spokesman.
What I can tell you is that she came to the country.
Since the beginning of 2013, border services officers at Montreal-Trudeau airport have carried out 173 drug seizures, including 10 cocaine seizures for a total of 44 kilograms.
In 2012, border services officers in the Quebec Region made a total of 1653 seizures of narcotic drugs.
Air raids against military installations in Syria
According to the Lebanese army, Israeli aircraft entered Lebanese airspace on Wednesday early in the afternoon, but the strikes took place in the evening.
A cargo of short-range SA-8 air-soil missiles would have been targeted and destroyed.
This new raid of the Tsahal aviation in Syrian territory (the sixth since the beginning of the year, according to the Israeli daily Haaretz) has not been confirmed by Israel or Syria.
The raid took place in some circumstances similar to the one that took place on July 5th: at the time, he was also an anonymous American leader who had confirmed to CNN an Israeli attack, this time aimed at Yakhon Sea-Solar missiles, delivered by Russia to Damascus.
The Israeli officials had not hidden their irritation from seeing Washington reveal the attack, at the risk of forcing President Assad to respond.
Ukraine approaches bankruptcy
The Standard & Poor's rating agency lowered Ukraine's solvency note Friday, challenging the ability of the former Soviet republic, in recession for more than a year, to meet its financial obligations.
The country's note of public debt securities goes to "B-", leading to the speculative investment category.
It has a negative perspective, with S&P seeing at least one chance on three that it is lowered again by one year.
"It is less and less likely that the government's strategy will guarantee enough foreign currency to meet its high external funding needs," the U.S. Agency explains.
The Agency notes that Ukraine's foreign exchange reserves have fallen by 26% between September 2012 and September 2013 and that the trend will continue.
This complicates the reimbursement of credits taken abroad.
These reserves, to which the authorities have resorted massively to support the local currency, the hryvnia, collapsing, the agency finds it more and more likely to devaluation, which would inflate its external debt.
Kiev also needs cash to settle its gas imports to Russia, which accuses it of not having paid an invoice of $882 million.
This announcement is a bad news for Ukrainian power in a period of intense tension with its Russian neighbour, angry at Kiev's willingness to sign an association agreement with the EU late November.
It was released following the publication of official statistics showing that the country's economy had suffered from its fifth quarter of contraction between July and September.
Its debt, still relatively modest, has exploded in recent years and S&P estimates it to 33.5% of GDP, compared with less than 10% before the 2008-2009 crisis.
The country, in a budget deficit, has been calling for the assistance of the International Monetary Fund for months, which in 2010 granted it a credit of $15.3 billion and has currently released only $3.4 billion.
But the Fund refuses to pay any new instalments until the country has adopted unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit, including by increasing gas prices to the population.
At the end of a new unsuccessful mission in the country, the IMF noted this week that "the important external financing needs" were "vulnerability", while respecting "signs of economic improvement".
However, for economist Oleksandr Joloud of the Centre for Political Studies, "it is not possible to expect an improvement in the short term".
"There is little hope that unpopular reforms will be launched in a pre-election year", with the presidential elections scheduled for 2015, the expert, interviewed at the AFP, said.
Only hope is an improvement in the international environment.
S&P is also the "uncertainty" associated with the possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU, which Brussels conditional on the release of opponent Ioulia Timoshenko.
"Signing the agreement would be positive for long-term trade, but there could be negative short- and medium-term consequences related to Russia's reaction," S&P explained, who fears Moscow's "commercial restrictions".
Russia, which represents the fourth of Ukrainian exports, has warned that in the event of the creation of a free trade area between the EU and Kiev, it should strengthen its border controls for imported goods.
U.S. Green Fire at the Merger Publicis-Omnicom
Publicis and Omnicom said on Friday they had received no objection from the US authorities to their merger, thus approaching the creation of the first global advertising agency.
The merger brings together the second world agency, Omnicom, and the third one, Publicis.
"Omnicom Group and Publicis Group today announced the expiry of the date of review of the previously announced merger of Publicis Groupe and Omnicom, scheduled by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended", announces the two groups in a communiqué.
They state that they have also received the necessary authorizations in Canada, India and Turkey, after South Africa and South Korea.
The expiry of the review period provided for by the HSR in the United States and the authorisation decisions issued in the other jurisdictions satisfy several of the conditions necessary for the completion of the transaction.
"The merger is also conditioned to obtain other regulatory authorities and to approve the shareholders of both groups," they add.
The Congolese army is hunting for the rebels of the M23
The Congolese army (FARDC) announced Thursday that its units would pursue the M23 rebels up to their bases in the forests and mountains of the neighbouring North Kivu of Rwanda and Uganda.
The M23 appears to be on the verge of being beaten after being expelled from the northeastern localities of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) which he controlled from the beginning 20 months ago from the insurrection.
"We're going to prosecute the M23 and take it wherever it hides because it's criminals," Colonel Olivier Hamuli told Reuters, spokesperson for the FARDC.
We must not let them get reorganized because they have been martyring the Congolese people for too long.
The time has come to bring peace back.
M23 officials explained that they evacuated the localities under diplomatic pressure and Bertrand Bissimwa, political leader of the rebellion, stated on RFI that these military reverses would in no way alter its claims to peace talks.
The latter, according to Ugandan mediators, resumed on Wednesday in Kampala between the government of Kinshasa and M23.
Crowds are reported in the hills that dominate Bunagana, the last town in the hands of the insurgents to fall this week, as well as around Runyoni, a hill where the rebellion of the M23 came out in 2012.
At their peak in November, the insurgents occupied Goma, head of the province of North Kivu, taking advantage of the flight of the government garrison and the passivity of the Blue Helmets of the Monusco.
The fall of Goma led to the United Nations Mission in DRC, the most important in terms of staffing, to strengthen its mandate and to form a rapid response brigade consisting of South African, Malawian and Tanzanian soldiers.
For his part, the FARDC headquarters was re-manded and the army passed the offensive against the M23, changing the course of the war.
The rate of progress of government troops is now unprecedented.
"The M23 seems to touch at its end," predicted a Congolese business expert, Jason Stearns, on his blog Congo Siasa.
This would be historic - it would be the first time that the Kinshasa government succeeded in defeating a major insurgency.
And it would also be the first time since 1996 that no Allied armed groups in Rwanda would be present in eastern DRC.
Experts from the United Nations accuse Rwanda of militarizing support for the M23 from former Congolese mutiny soldiers.
British diplomat William Hague invited Rwandan President Paul Kagame to show restraint, announced a spokesperson for the Foreign Office.
Last week Kigali had referred to the possibility of military retaliation as a result of shells falling into Rwandan territory.
Wednesday, the inhabitants of Bunagana invaded the streets of the village to greet the entry of the FARDC soldiers.
"We spent a year with the M23 and it seemed unimaginable to us to be one day released by the army," testified a resident of this neighboring town of Uganda.
"We lived in terror (from M23), we were traumatized," said this man.
The tests performed by the Pasteur Institute on a patient suspected of being infected with coronavirus were negative, the Ministry of Health announced.
He states that "the two cases identified in May 2013 remain the only two confirmed cases in France to date".
On Tuesday, this 43-year-old patient was suspected of being hit, after entering Saudi Arabia, a country where the disease has already killed some 50 people.
Chevron, the second American oil company, reported on Friday a decrease in its quarterly profit due to the decrease in its refining margins, while its oil and gas production increased while remaining withdrawn from the group's objectives.
Its net profit from the third quarter decreased to $4.95 billion, or $2.57 per share, compared to $5.25 billion, or $2.69 per share, a year ago.
Analysts interviewed by Reuters averaged a profit per share of $2.71.
The group produced 2.59 million barrels of oil equivalent per day during the quarter, up from 2.52 million bpj produced a year earlier.
The company targets 2.65 million bpj for this year, with a 25% increase in the production expected by 2017.
Most of the growth in the coming years will come from its liquefied natural gas projects in Australia.
Because of the cost of these projects, annual investment expenditures increased by $7 billion over two years and are projected to reach $30.7 billion in 2013.
Profits from production activities decreased slightly in the third quarter, while gains from downstream activities (including refining and chemical production) fell from 45% to $380 million.
This decline in refining margins affects the whole sector.
Thus Chevron's main competitor, Exxon Mobil reported on Thursday a net profit in decline, despite the increase in its gas and oil production.
Carriage of schoolchildren: the complaint found admissible
The School Commission of the Sherbrooke Region (CSRS) has been demanding from the beginning of the school year a fee of $150 per student (up to a maximum of $300 per family) for students with two residences, a service that the organization offers when it is in a position to do so.
Prior to the changes to the last budget, no financial contribution was required.
"There is a mediation service proposed by the commission and I was interested," says Lefèvre.
According to her, the CSRS was invited to a mediation and requested an additional period to reflect on it.
"It's always better to talk about it, get together and find solutions," says Lefèvre.
The School Commission of the Sherbrooke Region (CSRS) did not want to comment.
The organization only meant that mediation is part of the process during a complaint.
Imbroglio around the closure of the Hotel-Dieu emergency
Faced with the fraud carried out for several months by a part of the staff and several trade unions, including the CGT, the Minister of Health, Marisol Touraine, decided on 10 July to "deline the timetable for the implementation of the project, and in particular the closing date of the emergencies that will not be able to intervene on 4 November".
An official request "to take no risk of taking care of emergencies in Paris at the beginning of the winter" was also aimed at not disturbing the PS campaign to a few months of municipalities.
Despite ministerial instructions, closure should still be effective by that date.
Although, at PAHP, we prefer to use the term "transformation" or "change in continuity".
As of 4 November, firemen who had approximately one-quarter of the 40,000 annual crossings to the Hotel-Dieu emergencies will all have received the consent to take thirty serious cases per day to the emergencies of other Parisian hospitals.
This date of 4 November also corresponds to the renewal of boarding schools.
In the Hotel-Dieu, emergency specialists will leave place Monday to five general medical facilities.
With regard to the transfer of beds of internal medicine, it is scheduled for the current month.
"The emergency reception service of the Hotel-God must close as soon as possible, and for us, it is November 4th", assures Loïc Capron, president of the medical commission of establishment (CME) of the PAHP, who supports the management project without delay.
"On November 4, there will no longer be patients brought by firemen, only people coming through their own means," confirmed Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, the medical officer of the new Hotel-Dieu.
"But we will continue to welcome patients in emergency," he argued, claiming the permanent presence of SMUR vehicles on site to transfer serious cases.
Senior emergency doctors will remain on site, he will also ensure.
But it is up to the ARS to decide the closure of the emergency reception service.
"Things are taking place gradually," answers Nicolas Péju, spokesman of the ARS for whom, on November 4, "there will be no change in terms of service rendered."
"The minister lied to us or was lied to," deplores the emergency doctor Gérald Kierzek.
Leaving his position as head of the SMUR in early July for having led the fraud against the reorganisation project, he is defined as a "warning launcher" in the face of a "cynic" decision taken by "the medical-administrative technology".
"They are in the process of emptying and asphyxiing emergencies that have been renovated less than five years ago," he says.
For him, "if the other Parisian emergency services could absorb the surplus, there would be no problem."
But they are regularly fattened.
There are, for example, nine hours of waiting for the Lariboisière emergencies.
In the SRA, it is argued that thirty "dispatched" patients on several sites are not likely to represent "avalanche" in other emergency services, whose human resources will also have been strengthened.
In both the ARS and the PAHP, the "new hospital model" that has been launched since 7 October is being defended and which is expected to continue to accommodate 30,000 to 35,000 patients per year.
By the end of the year, liberal generalistic doctors should also be involved in the establishment of an "abundance of outpatient care".
"Where do we go if people are asked to be self-diagnosed," Gérald Kierzek wonders, "the concept of non-serious emergency" is "dangerous" and marks a "medical regression".
This is going to happen as for level 3 maternity.
People aren't crazy, they're going to go where there's the best care offer.
If the Minister does not take action by Monday, we will change the armrest, warns Christophe Prudhomme, emergency doctor and member of the CGT Health.
We will be even more present as part of the municipal campaign and will consider presenting a list.
In Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet's team, Vincent Roger, a Paris UMP advisor and elected to the 4th district, clearly announces that "even if the Parisan UMP was for the maintenance of emergencies at the Hotel-God, it would be technically and financially impossible to reopen them if we return to the responsibilities".
Anne Hidalgo, the PS candidate, once again recalled Monday morning on France Inter that she had spoken in favour of a moratorium so that there was no closure on 4 November.
If that were the case, she would make a clear disagreement, points out Bruno Julliard, his spokesman.
Although the restructuring of the Hotel-God has its legitimacy on the bottom, we cannot admit it without an acceptable pattern of deferral to the other hospitals.
Obama ends listening to the IMF and the World Bank
Barack Obama instructed the National Security Agency (NSA) to put an end to its hearings on the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as part of its intelligence activities, says an American leader on Thursday.
This decision is part of the White House's attempt to regain hands in the case of NSA listenings after the revelations made by former analyst Edward Snowden, refugee in Russia.
This is the first time that IMF and World Bank surveillance has been mentioned by the intelligence agency since the beginning of the scandal.
Questioned on the subject, a U.S. government official replied: "The United States does not conduct electronic monitoring of the World Bank and IMF headquarters in Washington."
Speaking under the seal of anonymity, this officer did not specify whether such monitoring had been put in place in the past.
Another official told him that Barack Obama had ordered to stop these practices over the past few weeks.
This instruction was given at about the same time as the one ending the hearings of the ONU headquarters in New York.
In this context, the Senate Intelligence Commission approved Thursday a strengthening of controls on government monitoring programmes but authorized their continuation.
The Commission has introduced further restrictions on the data that intelligence agencies are authorized to collect and has imposed a five-year limit on the conservation of this information.
The United Nations welcomes the new poverty reduction goals
The United Nations will now be working on a new set of goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which had been put in place 12 years ago to combat poverty in the world.
Australian diplomats have played a key role in advancing the “sustainable development goals” to replace the MDGs, which will expire in 2015, before the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development, which began on the eve of Rio de Janeiro.
They were included in the final preliminary draft of the document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on the eve of the summit that it was now time to "surpass national interests".
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch and appropriate the process of establishing universal sustainable development goals (SDGs)," he added.
These SDGs will build on the progress achieved under the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will do my utmost to carry out the mandate entrusted to me by the Member States to achieve our vision of the sustainable development goals that are based on the success of the MDGs.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing at the same time as conflicts between powerful personalities
At the foot of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder president of Mozambique, in the process of coughing them up, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo to scan peaceful slogans during a rare public event.
"We want peace to come back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, director general of an investment company.
Concerned about her country's future, she exchanged her work clothes against a tee-shirt with the mention "we want security" in Portuguese before joining the assembled crowd in the place of the Independence of the capital Thursday.
For two weeks there have been almost daily reports of conflicts between government forces and Renamo, the worst seizures since the peace agreement that was signed more than 20 years ago.
The Renamo was once a famous rebel movement, initially supported by Rhodesia governed by whites and then the apartheid government of South Africa as part of efforts to destabilize the country's independent government.
After a peace agreement signed in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country should not return to an open conflict, but recent events have shaken foreign investors and the local population.
The issue is considerable for the growing economy as the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the north-west could attract more than $50 million of investments over the coming years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale du Brasil, Eni d'Italia and Anadarko from the United States.
The Frelimo, the ruling party and the main political force since 1975, and the Renomo are mutually rejecting the responsibility of tensions.
Renamo states that the government is behind the recent clashes and has launched an attack on its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional bastion of the Renamo on October 17.
The attacks on the former rebels then degenerated when government forces attacked the bases of the Renamo and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakaama, the leader of the group, and Fernando Mazanga, the spokesman for the Renamo, according to the Financial Times.
The government makes Renamo responsible for triggering conflicts, and accuses her of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza sought to minimize concerns about instability.
Mr. Guebuza told the AFP on Wednesday, the French press agency, that Mr. Dhlakama considered himself a "lost" who wanted to use "all the forces he had left to try to prove that he could impose his decisions on the government."
Frelimo and Renamo insist that they both wish to avoid war.
But the concern grew after Mr. Mazanga stated that the Renamo abandoned the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT that he meant that the agreement was no longer respected by Frelimo.
"We want to resume negotiations, but with the greatest seriousness," said Mazanga.
The previous discussions between the parties have failed to alleviate the tensions fuelled by a series of conflicts this year.
"There are two great men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who continue to argue," explained Joseph Hanlon, an open and specialist lecturer at the University of Mozambique.
None of them can negotiate well and none of them are prepared to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo, which is in favour of electoral reforms, had already said that it would boycott the municipal elections to take place in November.
Presidential and legislative elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted its use of force as the attempt of a sick movement to obtain concessions and a war treasure from the government.
The share of the votes received by Renamo has been declining since 1992, while a new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which was created by a former member of the Renamo, is expected to achieve a greater number of votes in the elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Guebuza – who was supposed to retire at the end of his second term next year – wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
"He does not want a multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the presidency," said Mazanga.
We do not know exactly what the capacity of the Renamo is, but it has carried out disturbing lightning attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south highway.
Most seizures took place in the province of Sofala, which is located several hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but where Beira is located, the port where mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, export coal.
In June, Rio was no longer able to use the railway for about a week after the Renamo threatened to attack the railway line.
Mr. Mazanga was falsely shy when he was asked whether Renamo would return this threat.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique," said Mazanga.
Instability has strengthened the frustrations of the government, says Fernando Lima, director of Mediacoop, an independent media society, many people are also concerned about corruption, slow development and the recent wave of abductions.
"People think that the country's future is the government and the president, and that it's the last person to find solutions to the problems," he explained.
Omar Sultane, a protester, said that people only wanted stability.
"No one cares about Renamo or Frelimo, they just want to find peace, they want to have free access to the roads," he added.
Myths and legends should be taught to children as "lifestyle models," says the author.
Thor's Legend could show that "the brutal force does not make the weight in front of the subtle russia", while arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Saying that many myths would be "very violent, very scandalous, and in some cases too obscene to be taught at school," Crossley-Holland called for a "extensive selection" of works adapted to age.
"I find it wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education," he said.
I've been advocating this project for 20 years.
He added that the fact that the authors and teachers are "intremely didactic" makes children "completely detach", the messages being "sublimated" in pleasant stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and wrote The Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, said: "You may have good intentions, but you prefer to keep them out of sight."
Perhaps the great difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to offer hope.
Not that everything has to be simplified or finished well, but there is an innate sense of good and evil.
And it must be sublime; revealed through a story rather than declared.
The well-known basis of what we're showing and not saying.
One Hamas armed fighter was killed tonight and another injured by an Israeli tank fire in the Gaza Strip, was learned from medical and safety sources in Gaza.
According to these sources, these activists conducted a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian territory and Israel when they fired an Israeli armoured shell.
NSA espionage: the United States is "too far," admits Kerry
The United States has sometimes gone "too far" in the matter of espionage, has recognized Secretary of State John Kerry, in this first hearing of Washington in controversy with Europe on the massive collection of data by the National Security Agency (NSA).
After ten days of scandal, revelations and denials between the United States and their European allies, this is the first time that an American government official explicitly admits of the practices that have been controversial in the interception by the NSA of communications and data in Europe.
"In some cases, I grant it to you, as the President has done, some of these actions have gone too far and we will make sure that this does not happen in the future," said John Kerry at a conference in London which he attended since Washington on Thursday, October 31, by video link.
In his speech he retransmitted, in the presence of his British counterpart William Hague, the head of American diplomacy has long justified the practices of information and information collection by the necessary counter-terrorism and prevention of possible attacks.
Invoking the attacks of 11 September 2001, the attacks of Madrid in March 2004 and those of London in July 2005, John Kerry assured that the U.S. authorities had since enjoyed many plans for attacks, thanks to the interception of communications and the collection of information.
"We have actually prevented planes from falling, buildings from exploding and people being killed, because we were able to be aware of these projects," the US diplomat argued.
And John Kerry said to the Europeans, "I assure you that in this process innocent people have not been deceived."
But we are trying to gather information.
"And yes, in some cases, it went too far in an inappropriate way," the Secretary of State, who had already had to express himself on this international scandal during a tour last week in Paris, London and Rome.
He assured Thursday night that President Obama was "resolved to try to clarify and to review these practices so that no one feels wrong".
But the controversy between Americans and Europeans continued this week with new revelations in the press.
According to the Washington Post, the NSA intercepted data from hundreds of millions of users of Google and Yahoo.
The journal, which cites documents obtained from the former consultant of the NSA Edward Snowden, asserts that the program called "MUSCULAR" and conducted with the British counterpart of the NSA, the GCHQ, allows these two agencies to recover data from optical fibers used by Internet giants.
To believe that one of the documents, some 181 million elements had been collected in the last month alone - ranging from metadata on e-mails, text items or audio or video documents.
These interceptions would take place outside the United States.
But Yahoo and Google have denied any connection to these practices.
For ten days, several major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain or Italy have revealed that the NSA would have extensively intercepted data and communications from allies from the United States and their leaders, including the German chancellor Angela Merkel.
Faced with the anger of European states and while leaks in the American press claimed that the US president was not aware of such hearings, Barack Obama refused to express himself on this subject, calling for national security.
On the other hand, the boss of the powerful NSA, General Keith Alexander, has denied him that his intelligence agency has captured tens of millions of communications from European citizens.
He even referred the bullet to the European intelligence services that would have seized these communications before providing them to the NSA.
This would involve "military operations" in countries where these NATO allies cooperate with the United States and this would not aim at Europe, General Alexander said.
And the polemic spread Friday in Asia.
Indonesia convened Australia's ambassador, whose mission is accused of being used by Americans as part of a vast network of international espionage that also sparked China's air.
Paris Saint-Germain will receive Lorient Friday without its master asset, Swedish Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is wounded, announces the League 1 club in a communiqué.
The PSG, leader of the championship in front of Monaco, has released the list of players selected for this 12th day match, without the 32-year attacker.
The communiqué simply indicates that it is "blessed", without specifying the nature of the wound.
However, he suffered from an inflammation of the left knee on his return to selection, in the beginning of the month.
A memorial ceremony for the cremated dead
At 11 a.m., Father Lachaise's crematorium organizes a secular ceremony in memory of all the deceased crematized in his establishment during the year.
Anne Hidalgo, a socialist candidate at the Paris City Hall, will attend and explain his proposals for a funeral at a press conference.
To follow the ceremony, click on it.
For their own obsessions, more and more French choose cremation, rather than inhumation: 53%, according to an Ipsos study conducted on 6 and 7 September with 1009 people, instead of 47%.
For the shells of a neighbor, it is the reverse: the French prefer inhumation (53% versus 47%).
If they are in danger of losing a child, they are only 15% to choose cremation.
In his book La Mort en ashres, Damien Le Guay, philosopher and vice-president of the National Committee on Funeral Ethics, stresses the "violence" that constitutes cremation, for survivors.
There is, with cremation, "a violence done to the beloved body", which will be "reduced to a lot of ashes" in very little time, and not after a decomposition process, which "will accompany the phases of mourning".
There is also "a symbolic violence", which relates to the "refuse of singularity and distinctive signs" reduced to the "anonymity" of ashes.
Why is what is readily accepted in some Nordic and Protestant countries still bad in France?
"Because cremation is a new fact," says Marie-Frédérique Bacqué, president of the Society of Thanatology and author of the book Apprivoiser la morte.
It has only been tolerated since 1963 by the Catholic Church, which has limited attempts to appraise it.
Appriving the cremation, it is for François Michaud-Nérard, Director General of Funeral Services of the City of Paris, to provide for the deceased a ceremony as dignified as that to which he would be entitled with a burial.
The annual Ipsos survey shows a very strong commitment to the organization of the ceremony.
77% of French people want one, for their relatives, whether they are religious (53%) or civil (24%).
Now 73% of those who have chosen a cremation want to organize a ceremony.
66% of atheists or non-believers want it too.
Crematoriums have adapted to this evolution of society.
"For the past ten years, they have been trying to avoid the violence of a wait for families, without doing anything, for an hour and a half, immediately followed by the remission of ashes," says Michaud-Nérard.
70% of the institutions now offer masters of ceremonies, who proceed, in the presence of the body, to the following ritual: to welcome the assembly, to name the deceased, to link it to others, to evoke it, to give meaning to its death, to organize the farewell.
This is the case at Father Lachaise's crematorium, since 1998.
Ceremonial masters are often people who have converted.
There are also former Catholic priests.
It is within this framework that the Crematorium of Father Lachaise has been organizing, since 2010, the day of La Toussaint, several ceremonies of remembrance, secular and non-religious, to which he invites the families of people who have been cremated in the year.
For the second consecutive year, one of these ceremonies is retransmitted to the attention of those who could not travel.
The crematorium has allowed us to relay it.
In La Seyne, the relocation for rats turns to polemic
At the beginning of the week, a family left their apartment on the ground floor of the Fructitor D2 building, due to the presence of rats.
In the face of the emergency, the Director of the South Habitat Land Office proposed, in an exceptional and temporary manner, to accommodate the couple and their three children in a new T4.
However, the family refuses "for financial reasons" and the situation is blocked.
The case took exaggerated proportions, estimates Joël Canapa, the director of the office.
Rats, there's always been in the cities.
The deratisation company carries out two passages per year, and in addition, at our expense, we intervene at every request of the inhabitants.
We have thus made 64 interventions since the end of the winter.
The neighborhood is not abandoned, and rats do not spray in the city.
For reasons of environmental protection and public health, deratisation products are four times less effective than in the past, but for two rats, one child will not be killed.
"We didn't invite the rats at home," the family father defends himself who left his home to settle in the hotel.
We are soon without the soil and we expect a new accommodation, at the same rate as the old one.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange is down 0.88%, News
The Tokyo Stock Exchange came down on Friday despite good Chinese manufacturing statistics.
The rating passed from the decline of the dollar to the yen, prejudicial to the export values and the warning of Sony's annual outcome launched Thursday.
The Nikkei index lost 126.37 points (0.88%) to 14 201.57 and the Topix yielded 11.23 points (0.94%) to 1 183.03.
Sony fell from over 11% to 1,668 yen.
A house preyed on flames in Old Quebec
A fire that started on Friday at noon in Old Quebec was quickly controlled.
More than 30 firefighters were sent to 9 Hébert Street.
The flames were reported in a three-storey house on four floors behind the Quebec Seminary Court.
All the tenants were absent during the fire.
The fire was mastered an hour after the firemen arrived, which were many to intervene.
As soon as our first firefighters arrived, they really saw apparent smoke.
"Then the alarms succeeded, because it took strength to attack the building, because it is buildings glued here," explained France Loiselle, spokesman for the Québec firefighters.
An investigation is under way to find the cause of this fire.
Ben Greenman: Tenth Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It could be said that the city of New York is the place where the booth was born in America: almost 100 years ago, the actor of voudeville Frank Fay, who held the role of master of ceremony at the Palace Theatre, on Broadway, began to tell jokes directly to the public about the tone of the conversation.
Fay's innovation has continued over the years, until it is resumed more recently by the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and supervised by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the Carolines stand-up club, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 shows presented in small clubs and major theatres.
"Most poster heads emerged in Carolines, and were very successful, until they became too famous to play in a club," Hirsch said.
We created this festival in order to be able to continue working with them.
This year's event will see the participation of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and the presentation of "Stand Up for Heroes", a comedy and music evening for former fighters, organized at Madison Square Garden, to which will be present, among others, Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
The festival has grown, as has the world of comedy.
Several of the actors participating in this year's festival have been through non-traditional circuits, for example by presenting shows on small television channels, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll made his appearance on the front of the stage in a sitcom on a cable chain ("The League" on the theme of fantasy football jolly lasciful of the FXX channel) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate participated in the Saturday Night Live show and was part of the casting of the series " Parks and Recreation", but she is even more known for her series of viral videos " Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Kroll and Slate, as well as other single-voiced young comedians (surrealist pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic defender of racial justice W. Kamau Bell), are pure products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the main attractions of the festival this year will be an interview: David Steinberg discussing with Larry David.
Steinberg started as a stand-up comedian, but he became an accomplished film and television director, as well as an informal comedy historian.
Between 2005 and 2007, he hosted a TV Land show called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting takes place at the City Hall in central Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the comical DNA of all Larry's work," Steinberg said.
He told me that, when he was here, he sometimes went down a street between two buildings and said, Well, if I lost all my money, maybe I'd come to live here.
Oil prices continue to drop and close to $96 per barrel
Oil prices continued to decline on Friday, while concerns about the importance of stocks offset a report showing that the electricity supply industry in China is growing.
The price of the U.S. gross for delivery in December dropped from $14 cents to $96.24 per barrel at the end of the morning in Europe during electronic exchanges on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
The contract lost 39 cents on Thursday, leaving it with a decrease of 5.8% for October.
The high supply of crude oil has weighed on the price in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy reported Wednesday that U.S. supplies increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, supplies increased by over 25 million barrels.
But two reports on the Chinese manufacturing sector arrived on Friday, which show a growth in activity, suggest an increase in demand.
This suggests that China's economic recovery could continue to grow further after growth increased to 7.8% in the third quarter, after a decrease that had not been known since two decades in the previous quarter.
The gross Brent, a reference for the international crude already used by the American refineries, lost 26 cents to drop to $108.58 per barrel on Inter-Continental Exchange (ICE) in London.
Adjudication of the Right to Abortion in Texas
A federal court of appeal has restored in Texas certain restrictions on the right of voluntary abortion of pregnancy that had been blocked by a Trial Judge this week.
This judgment means that a law adopted in July in that State and which largely undermines the right to abortion will be able to enter into force.
The judgment of the Court of Appeal means that doctors who will practice IVG will have to have a "privilege of admission" with local hospitals.
The privilege of admission is the right of a physician, under his/her/her status as a care member of a hospital, to admit a patient to a hospital or medical centre in order to deliver a diagnosis or treatment.
IVG advocates argue that the content of the law may result in an immediate closure of one third of state clinics because these clinics have failed to obtain this "privilege of admission" for their practitioners.
In total, nearly 22,000 women would be deprived of access to these facilities.
On Monday, a court judge considered on the eve of the entry into force of the law that the provisions dealing with the privilege of admission were unconstitutional.
But the Attorney General of Texas, Republican Greg Abbott, who is in charge of the governor's position, asked the Court of Appeal to cancel the trial of the first instance, which blocked the enforcement of the law.
A plenary hearing on this issue is scheduled for January.
The New Star has succeeded in a strong return, audience side, with 1.3 million viewers behind their TV station, or 5.6% from the audience.
But was the show at the meeting?
Some 10,000 candidates presented themselves to the hearings of this 10th season, to confront the jury: Maurane, the wicked Sinclair, the perched André Manoukian and Olivier Bas.
On Twitter, viewers shared their comments.
After the excitement of finding their favorite program, many were disappointed.
But why such disappointment?
No candidate seems to have really scored at this first premium.
Like every year, the first hearing shows embrace a wide range of grass singers, for the best and sometimes for the worst.
Now, on Twitter, we want show, emotion, originality, music...
Fortunately, some have found their account.
Many of them have tried the New Star, and sometimes even gone to the end.
Behind the TV screens, the vocations of successful singer are always there, season after season.
Others are just excited to laugh.
The Court blocks a decision on the NYPD control and search policy
A Federal Court of Appeal blocked Thursday the decision of a judge demanding changes in the New York Police Department's control and search program and dropped the file.
The United States Court of Appeal (Second Circuit) indicated that the decision of Judge Shira Scheindlin was suspended until the end of the appeal filed by the city.
The judge had ruled in August that the city had violated the Constitution following the implementation of its programme to control and interrogate citizens.
The city appealed to its conclusions and corrective orders, including a decision to assign a controller to help the police department change its associated policy and training program.
The Court of Appeal heard on Tuesday the arguments concerning the application for suspension.
The Court of Appeal stated that the judge should be destabilized because she violated the code of conduct of judges by compromising the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of bias, partly because of a series of interviews with the media and public statements in which she responded publicly to court critics.
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by wrongly targeting black and Hispanic men as part of their monitoring and search programme.
It has appointed an external controller to oversee the changes, including policy reform, training and supervision, and has ordered the establishment of a pilot programme to test the body cameras in areas where the largest number of controls are taking place.
In August, the city of New York agreed to terminate the practice of retaining the names and addresses of persons who were dismissed after police control.
The city's hearing of the appeal is expected to take place after March 14, 2014.
The tactics of control and search have been criticized by many civil rights defenders.
This control and search system has been in existence for decades in some form, but the number of registered controls has increased dramatically under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, to reach its highest historical level in 2011 with 684,330 controls that were mainly related to black men and of Hispanic origin.
A judicial action was introduced in 2004 by four men, all from minorities, and turned into collective action.
The supporters advocating changes in the NYPD monitoring and search program say that they will end unfair practices, allow for more effective and trusted police forces, and may change the way police departments use policy.
Opponents say that these changes undermine the morale of the police without reducing crime, represent a waste of money and do not solve the broader problem of under pressure police forces after police personnel have been severely reduced over the past decade.
The judge pointed out that it did not end the constitutional control and search practices, but that it reformed the way the NYPD implemented its controls.
Renters must go to vote, as each of them pays an average of $100 per month on the price of accommodation that goes to taxes to the City.
When the owner pays $5,000 in municipal taxes, he divides this amount between each dwelling.
We are obliged to increase the rents to help us pay the new taxes.
By going to vote, we send a clear message.
We need to change things in the city.
All the candidates told us they were going to attack the scandalous debt.
We no longer have the means to pay us fireworks at $100,000, land from $4 to $5 million in case...
Go vote, that's the best way to express yourself and say it's enough.
End of service for chef chef chef de l'Elysée
Entering the 500 m2 of Elysean kitchens as committed after working in embassies, the cook severed all the steps until he became chief nine years ago.
He served six French presidents, from Georges Pompidou to François Hollande, passing through Nicolas Sarkozy, including on their vacation places, and nourished an incalculable number of greats of this world in a near-anonymity which he breaks only today, at the time of retirement, at 60 years of age.
The man with an open face, skull and intellectual glasses, born on 24 October 1953 in Ferté-Saint-Aubin, holds a pastry CAP.
Her mother was herself a cook in a Castle of Sologne.
"I went from one castle to the other!" ironic Bernard Vaussion, who knows not only the mania of the six presidents for which he has made his own office, but also their wives and some of their distinguished guests.
"It's always the head of the state or his partner or wife who chooses the menus," he recalls.
"Mme Chirac was a little more involved, she came straight into the kitchen," to the point that she had banned women in the kitchens of Elysée!
He is not pleased with Heads of State who showed relative indifference to terrestrial food, "they are all greedy," falsely denounces Bernard Vaussion.
Jacques Chirac certainly had "a little more developed appetite".
But with Nicolas Sarkozy, who had removed the cheese, the plates returned empty!
As for François Hollande, who restored the cheese, "it's someone who likes to eat" and "there's not much he doesn't like."
The current head of state, who returned the kilos lost before the presidential campaign, has "no demand for specific regime".
Bernard Vaussion also remembers the pressure that weighed on his shoulders, especially during the state dinners at Elysée: it is necessary to serve "between 200 and 250 people in about an hour".
The previous night is almost white.
These people wouldn't understand that there are mistakes.
The former chef of Elysée's kitchens, who took a drink Tuesday night with his team, his family and friends, left with a brush in his heart."François Hollande came to greet me."
He said praise.
"The human side is out," he says.
The chief will be replaced by his deputy, Guillaume Gomez, 35 years old, who has been in Elysée for 17 years.
Fire in a house built in 1850 in Quebec
A historic house built in 1850 was the prey of the flames in Old Quebec Friday noon.
The four-bedroom building, located on 15 Hébert Street, was the subject of three alarms to the fire department.
The fire went forward, but stood on the three floors of the building.
France Voiselle, spokesperson for the Fire Protection Service in Quebec, explained that the rapid response of firefighters has prevented the spread of flames to adjacent buildings, a major challenge for this area of the city where buildings are built in close proximity.
The fire house was home to four homes, but no tenants were on site at the time of the fire.
The damage was all limited, even if the water caused damage.
An investigation will be conducted to determine its origin, but the sapers have ruled out the thesis of a criminal act.
The Wall Street Wolf: Exit of the second trailer
Martin Scorsese lets a few images of his next film, whose title role, that of an ambitious New York broker, is incarnate by Leonardo DiCaprio.
Forget to be reasonable and get your tickets out.
Leonardo DiCaprio will defuse you in his role as a disentangled trader.
Martin Scorsese tells us the true story of a "court in Long Island Stock Exchange, who refuses to collaborate with the authorities in a vast case of corruption on Wall Street".
In the 1980s, Jordan Belfort then set up a herring that would make him a rich, very rich man.
The opportunity to follow his incredible ascension, but also the vertigo fall that will follow.
Without limits, man is chained to parties, women, drugs.
Deceit and excesses in any kind are the master words of this crazy story.
The couple Scorsese-DiCaprio seems to have found the magic that had united them in Shutter Island.
The departure of the new Scorsese has delayed due to its too long mounting.
Looks like the movie finally lasts 2:45.
In the hall on 25 December, he will be able to take part in the Oscar race.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a pipe
The former editor-in-chief of News of the World Andy Coulson would have used "telephone hacking, surveillance and confrontation" to try to confirm a bidon pipe on a link involving the Minister of the Interior then in exercise, Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC declared before the Old Bailey Court that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with Hannah Pawlby, her "beautiful special counsellor."
It was reported to the court that the newspaper commissioned Glenn Mulcaire, a private detective, to hack into Pawlby's voice box and to "plant permanently in front of his door", but Coulson also called him and left him voice messages.
"The accusation suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor-in-chief of NotW, is not the kind of man to stay in front of people's house hoping to surprise them, is the kind of man to love to present history to people to see what they say," said Edis.
He stated that NotW used three means to investigate the issues: telephone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor-in-chief is personally involved in the third.
It is clear that it is aware of the second, the surveillance, it cannot be otherwise.
But what about the first one?
Does he know about phone hacking?
He says otherwise, but we say "Yes, of course."
The rumors about a link involving Clarke were first picked up by the NotW editorial office when a source, experiencing sexual attraction to Miss Pawlby, said that she had been told: "Don't waste your time with her, she's with Charles."
A band, on which were registered pirated voice messages on its phone at least three times, was seized at Mulcaire's home in August 2006.
The investigators also found seizures on the private detective's computer that concerned Miss Pawlby and her sister in a "Projects" file.
During the time the detective investigated it, Ms. Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous calls for information on it, he added.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup supervised the supervision of Miss Pawlby's least facts and actions.
In a vocal message he left him on June 18, 2005, Coulson said, "I have a story that we plan to publish tomorrow, which I would really like to talk to Charles."
Mr. Edis explained that Coulson's involvement in history followed the same pattern with other important men, such as the former Minister of Interior David Blunkett.
The jury heard Thursday that Coulson had met Mr. Blunkett about a connection with a married woman while he himself attended the co-defender Rebekah Brooks, who was also married at that time.
Coulson and Brooks refuse to have conspired with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted to having engaged in telephone piracy.
Barack Obama receives Iraqi Prime Minister, full of violence
The President of the United States was scheduled to receive on Friday, November 1, 2013 Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki, seeking United States assistance in combating the strongest wave of violence for five years.
Iraq's most murderous month in October was five and a half years, according to figures published on Friday, November 1, by the Iraqi authorities.
964 people died in violence in October, including 855 civilians, 65 police officers and 44 soldiers, and 1,600 people were injured.
The United Nations provides an even higher balance sheet with 979 deaths and 1,902 injuries.
These violence are increasingly fatal despite reinforced security measures and large military operations launched for months by the Shiite-dominated government of Nouri Al Maliki.
The total number of deaths in October is the highest since April 2008, when 1,073 people were killed.
About two years after the withdrawal of US troops, the level of violence causes a new embrace to be feared while neighboring Syria is in the midst of a civil war.
Bombs hit markets, mosques, marriages and funerals.
Men are shot down on the street or even at home, and security forces are also the target of frequent attacks.
The growing discontent of the Sunni minority, under Saddam Hussein, who is complaining of being politically marginalized and targeted for unfair arrests, has promoted this outbreak of violence.
On Friday, new violence killed four people in northern Iraq, following the death of at least 26 people in a series of attacks, including the explosion of five cars trapped in northern Baghdad.
Much of the violence was perpetrated by the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (EIIL), a group affiliated to Al-Qaida (Sunnite extremists), also involved in the civil war in Syria.
Nouri Al Maliki wants a "world war" against Al-Qaida.
The violence is at the center of the U.S. talks of Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki who will be received on Friday by President Barack Obama, two years after their previous meeting, on December 12, 2011.
At that time, the US President, elected on the promise to end military engagement in that country, had provided an optimistic picture of the situation.
Since his arrival on Wednesday in Washington, Nouri Al Maliki has multiplied the meetings with the executive, and the elected members of Congress.
Thursday, he called for the international community to carry out a "third world war" against Al-Qaida.
The principle of increased security assistance to Iraq is supported by influential Republican and Democratic senators.
But the latter also criticized Nouri Al Maliki, a Shiite, giving him partial responsibility for the resumption of violence by his "sectary and authoritarian policy".
They also demanded from Barack Obama that he make Nouri Al Maliki understand that "the pernicious influence of Iran within the Iraqi government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship."
Beijing accuses an ouighour group of the attack of Tiananmen
The head of Chinese Homeland Security accused a group of Xinjiang Uighur separatists on Friday of being behind the car-trapped attack that killed five people in Tiananmen Square in central Beijing on Monday.
The vehicle, an SUV, went dark on the crowd that was in the famous place of the Chinese capital, symbol of the murderous repression carried out in 1989, and caught fire killing its three passengers and two passengers.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Political Bureau responsible for internal security issues, accused the Islamic movement of East Turkmenistan of being the instigator of this attack.
Many oighours, a Turkish-speaking minority in Xinjiang, call this Chinese province East Turkestan.
For the Chinese government, this movement is responsible for the frequent eruptions of violence that occur there, driven by independent claims.
"The violent terrorist incident in Beijing has been organised and premeditated," Meng told the Hong Kong chain Phoenix TV.
"The group that stood behind was the Islamic movement of East Turkestan," he added, as his words were repeated by the new Chinese agency.
The Chinese police identified the driver of the vehicle whose name suggests that he was from Ouighour and specified that his wife and mother were in the car with him.
The latter also contained receptacles filled with gasoline and a flag with Orthodox religious inscriptions.
The incident injured 42 people.
The Islamic movement of East Turkestan is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations.
The Vatican investigates contraception, divorce and homosexuality
The Vatican has undertaken a major worldwide survey of how parishes manage sensitive records such as contraception, divorce and couples of same-sex people.
The survey asked participants how priests deal with gay couples and their children, and how they treat men and women who live together without being united by marriage bonds.
The survey was sent in mid-October to each of the bishops' national conferences, with the intention of getting as many answers as possible.
The information will serve as an important gathering on the family that Pope Francis plans to organize next year.
The news was reported on Thursday by the National Catholic Reporter, an independent Catholic newspaper in the United States.
A spokesperson for the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops confirmed that the document was authentic and that each bishop would decide the appropriate way to probe the parishioners.
In the United Kingdom, bishops published the online survey by asking Catholics to participate.
DRC: The Army Attacks the Last Fif of Rebels · Global Voices
The irreducibles of the M23, or a few hundred combatants, were set at about 2000 metres high on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and Jomba, two localities located about 80 km north of Goma, the capital of the province of North Kivu.
"It hasn't stopped since this morning, the fighting continues despite the night," said AFP, a Jumba resident, who was joined by phone around 12:30, and according to which a girl was wounded by a bullet in the morning.
"The intensity of the clashes has declined a little," he added, "it seems that the FARDC Armed Forces of the DRC have pushed the rebels a little."
According to this witness wishing to remain anonymous, the soldiers had "past the night" in Jomba before they got to the front for a "cartage operation".
There was a clear understanding behind him of cracking with small arms.
De Bunagana, political fief and last strong place of the rebellion that fell on Wednesday, an AFP journalist could hear heavy weapons detonations.
According to a source to the United Nations Mission for Stabilization of DRC, the fights entered "in a final phase", the FARDC "involved the residual M23 positions to dislocate them".
Since the resumption, on Friday, of clashes between the March 23 Movement (M23) and the army, Monusco does not participate directly in the fighting, but it provides government troops with decisive support for intelligence, observation and planning.
At the end of the afternoon, several dozen soldiers, well supplied in ammunition, were riding towards the front line.
They were armed with kalachnikov and rocket launchers.
Earlier, on the road to Bunagana, border crossing with Uganda, civilian-aided soldiers loaded a multiple rocket launcher mounted on a new FARDC flaming truck, to take up another gear driving M23 positions on the hills.
Congolese President Joseph Kabila called again on Wednesday evening the rebels to "demobilize voluntarily" without being disarmed "by force", but left open the Kampala process, where Kinshasa and M23 have been discussing since December without results for now.
On the spot, the political leaders of the M23 hope to reach an agreement.
"We have finished the talks, we are left only to Ugandan mediation to organize the signature," said Roger Lumbala, Vice-President of the M23 delegation, without this information being confirmed immediately on the government side.
The M23 was born of a mutiny in April 2012 of former rebels, mainly Tutsi, integrated into the army in 2009 after a peace agreement.
The United Nations and Kinshasa regularly accuse Uganda and Rwanda of supporting the M23, which rebuts Kigali and Kampala.
North Kivu is one of the most densely populated regions of the DRC, and its basement is full of coveted mining resources.
In Bunagana, on the Ugandan side of the border, where approximately 5,000 people had been refugees between Monday and Wednesday according to the United Nations, the movement back to the DRC that had begun in the morning had reversed at mid-day.
"We went back to our fields this morning, but the military told us to return," said AFP Imelda Nyirankusi, surrounded by his nine children, including a baby on the back.
It seems that firefights are getting closer to populations.
At the beginning of the evening, dozens of people crossed the border, some with a mattress on their head, to spend the night in Uganda.
The musical comedy, this beast of stage
Classical, sophisticated, popular, in English or French, the productions sung and dances take their flight.
After Broadway and London, Paris finally finds its voice.
It's a revolution: French music asserts itself like a successful genre.
Long ago, from Notre-Dame de Paris to Mozart rock opera, most of the attempts were in the ridicule.
And the successes like Cabaret or the Miserables carried the aureole of mystery.
Jean-Luc Choplin's arrival at Chatelet and Stage Entertainment in Mogador changed the women.
Today, these two scenes handle titles like successful tubes.
The first one, this Christmas, its excellent My Fair Lady and announces for the following world-wide creation of "An American in Paris".
In Mogador, "La Belle et la Bête" could well be one of the success of the season.
On other scenes, musical shows such as "1789", "the lovers of the Bastille" and small musical comedies such as "Disco" or "Life and Times" stand out for success and quality.
Patrick Niedo, author of the reference book "History of Musical Comedies" and lecturer at the Theatre du Châtelet, analyzes the reasons for the success so painfully conquered.
How do French music comets evolve?
The offer has multiplied.
First, there are the "musical shows" that evolve to the benefit of producers...
Some use beautiful projections of images and a true story as in 1789, the Lovers of the Bastille.
Others make a 15-year back bond on the pretext that we can use almost anything when we have Matt Pokora in front of the poster.
Then we have the musicals with the sumptuous productions of the Châteaut that make us relive the golden age of Broadway and discover the universe of Stephen Sondheim, the greatest living composer.
Stage Entertainment popularizes Anglo-Saxon music comedies of variety by adapting them in French.
Independent French producers try a breakthrough.
But ongoing projects such as "Rent", "Baiser de la femme aranignée" or "L'Éveil d' Spring" have a hard time being funded.
Do we have enough capable artists like Broadway singer, play and dance?
In Paris, when there are eight musical shows in one season, it's a big year.
We have 200 talented artists who turn from project projects.
In the United States, the cradle of musical comedy is very different.
Young people are trained in these trades in many schools.
There are many jobs among the regional theatres, tours, Broadway, the off-Broadway...
The talent eater is also responsible for the number of posts to be filled.
Why are tours to the province so successful?
With the exception of the opera, the province remains the poor relative of culture in France.
Few theatre plays go on tour and it is often boulevard theatre for adults and not young adults.
Music shows fill this gap.
It is these same young people who love telereality and what it produces as ephemeral stars...
Proposing beautiful young men (often talented) at the head of a musical show, is the assurance of an enchantment of these girls and often of their entire family.
The Facebook pages of these shows are often held by professionals who answer questions.
These shows are very expected when they arrive in a Zenith of province.
The mayonnaise is climbed to Paris and tasted by the provincials.
The show is designed to enter all the large rooms of France in the same form as in Paris.
A grave injury in an accident with a ghost driver on the ring of Brussels
A road accident caused a serious injury on Friday morning around 5:30 p.m. on the interior ring of Brussels up to Hoeilaart, towards Waterloo.
A driver's car was trampled by a ghost driver, who is free of charge.
The ring was closed to traffic up to 9.00 a.m. at the location of the accident, the time the road was derailed and an expert determined the circumstances of the accident.
However, this situation has not caused any bottlenecks since the accident took place at Hoeilaart exit.
The circulation could therefore be diverted by this output/entry of the ring.
A child badly injured in an attraction in Disneyland Paris
A five-year-old child was severely injured as a result of an accident on an attraction in Disneyland Paris.
His vital prognosis is no longer committed, but he is still hospitalized.
At the time of the fall, the boy was with his father on a boat of the attraction "Caribbean Pirates".
She's been shut down until further notice.
DRC: Army Prepares New Attack · Global Voices
Children play on a carbonized shield belonging to M23 rebels in Kibumba on October 31, 2013 in eastern DRC.
The Congolese army was preparing on Friday for a new assault on the last bastions of the M23 rebels near Bunagana, in eastern DRC.
The aim is to relocate the M23 from the hills that overlap Bunagana.
Yesterday, we took the hill of Bugina, which overruns the hill of Mbuzi.
Today, Mbuzi should fall on her own.
It will only remain the hill of Runyonyi.
"The Chanzu is not very strategic," the Governor of North Kivu, Julien Paluku, told the AFP.
Mr. Paluku is planning to visit Bunagana on Saturday.
Political fire and last high place of the rebellion, this town is located on the Ugandan border, about 80 km north of Goma.
It was resumed on Wednesday by the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo on Wednesday.
Since then, a few hundred irreducibles of the M23 have been set at about 2,000 metres high on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and the nearby town of Jomba
In Jomba, an inhabitant who reported fighting near Thursday all day indicated that the situation has been "quiet since this morning".
According to him, a woman and her child were killed by the fighting of the day before and were buried.
One girl was shot, and three other people were injured, one of whom, evacuated by the FARDC, added this witness quoted by the AFP.
Since the resumption of fighting between FARDC and rebels on 25 October, the two belligerents have given no account of the loss of human lives.
The NSA's revelations increase the paranoia of enterprises in respect of State surveillance
On a fine day in late August, a German police helicopter flew over the British Consulate of Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital.
At the order of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German National Intelligence Agency, its mission was to photograph the roof of the American front office, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media explained that BfV hoped to identify the presence of listening antennas and that the operation had an exchange between the United States and the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Clapper, the Director of American Intelligence Services, again stressed in September that the United States does not use its foreign intelligence capabilities to "save the industrial secrets of foreign companies on behalf of American companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits".
But since Edward Snowden, the consultant became a denouncing, he has begun to disclose his inexhaustible treasure of information on the secrets of US surveillance, European governments and business leaders no longer know whether to believe the Director in word.
Reports, according to which the U.S. National Security Agency spyed on the Brazilian Petrobras oil company and had access to data held by US suppliers of storage services in the Cloud, including Google and Yahoo, have more than ever raised the paranoia of companies in respect of state surveillance.
The revelation that the German chancellor's phone Angela Merkel had been hacked, perhaps even for a decade, was the drop of water that overcame the vessel.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then business leaders are certainly also potential targets.
Snowden has made the intensive collaboration between U.S. intelligence services and businesses transparent.
I believe that it is conceivable that these data are used in their mutual interest.
"Germany must wake up," says Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, representing German SMEs in the IT sector.
German companies believe that the United States poses as important a risk as China in terms of industrial espionage and data theft, according to a July survey published by the EY consulting firm.
However, in all the documents presented by Mr Snowden, there is no indication to this day that the United States has transmitted industrial secrets from foreign companies to American companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU did not have sufficient IT and Internet capabilities and believed that it should strive to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Business leaders are skeptical about this.
A Member of the German Parliament said that we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly reopen them...
"It's not the right way to do it," says Hasso Plattner, president of the German company for enterprise software, SAP.
If we wanted a strong European IT industry, then we didn't have to let it die 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany, from coal to cars, through farmers.
Everything except the IT industry.
However, the magnitude and sophistication of American espionage agencies exposed by Snowden's revelations has been a shock to some companies that had until then felt that China represented the greatest risk in terms of surveillance.
A major change is taking place in cloud computing as European leaders have become aware that the data stored in the United States are governed by the laws of that jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a professional organization, some 10% of non-American members gave up their projects to use an American cloud storage service provider after disclosure on the US Prism Data Exploration Program.
Jim Snabe, co-director of SAP, says: "Our customers are asking us today a question they didn't ask us a year ago: where are my data kept and can you assure me that they will stay physically in that jurisdiction?"
Many German leaders point out that the latest reports are merely a confirmation of what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and that this data must therefore be kept at all costs.
It is not surprising that economic espionage exists.
There's always been.
"It has been a recurring topic for many years and nothing has fundamentally changed in the current discussion," said Kurt Bock, Director General of the BASF Chemicals Producer Society.
The Americans are spying on us commercially and industrially just as we are spying on them, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.
Business leaders are generally reluctant to reveal the preventive measures they have put in place, if this would leave the advantage to an opponent.
The large companies have long hammered the message that it is for the least unwise to retrieve a free USB key during a professional salon or to leave a laptop without supervision in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the board of directors of the Audi car manufacturer, states that the collection of mobile phones before the board meetings, so that they cannot be used as remote listening devices, has been a common practice for years.
Germany's BfV advises its leaders to consider using simple prepaid mobile phones on their trips abroad because of the risk of affecting smartphone integrity.
The prepaid mobile phones are then thrown out.
However, it is feared that small and medium-sized enterprises will remain vulnerable to piracy and surveillance.
In Germany, many SMEs are world leaders in their particular niche.
"SMEs often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect their industrial secrets from unauthorized access," BfV warned in a report.
The United States alerts its own companies to economic espionage activities carried out by other countries.
The United States of America's National Estimated Intelligence (NIE) in February cited France, as well as Russia and Israel, second-degree perpetrators of piracy of economic information, behind China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of a renowned German company believed that when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst."
Bernard Squarcini, former director of French intelligence, the DCRI, said in an interview this month: "The services know perfectly well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, spy on their allies."
The parents of a teenager in Georgia, who died under unusual circumstances, believe that their son has been murdered
The parents of a teenager in Georgia, whose body was found in a treadmill in the gymnasium of his high school, believe their son was murdered, said the family lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valdosta in Georgia, was found on the 11th of January stuck in a supported carpet standing behind the steps of his high school gymnasium.
The sheriff's investigators of Lowndes County concluded that Johnson died under unusual circumstances, but the 17-year-old boy's family contests these findings.
"They are absolutely certain that their son has been murdered," said Benjamin Crump, lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, on FoxNews.com.
They never thought he was dead as indicated in the sheriff's conclusions.
"They think it challenges all logic, laws of physics as well as common sense," Crump added.
They are convinced that these conclusions have been delivered for the sole purpose of covering the person(s) responsible for the death of their son.
"They sent their son to school with a signboard, and he was taken to a mortuary bag," he added.
The U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said Thursday he was conducting an official investigation into Johnson's death, stressing that several important questions remained unanswered.
What is the cause of death?
Is his death the result of a criminal act?
Moore spoke at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'll follow the facts wherever they are.
My goal is to discover the truth.
"I believe there is a sufficient basis" to open an official investigation, he said.
Moore told journalists that the first autopsy indicated that Johnson died from "positional asphyxia".
However, a second autopsy identified another cause of death, according to Moore.
"Many questions still deserve an answer or confirmation," he said.
Moore added that if he updates evidence of a civil or criminal investigation into Johnson's death, he will ask the FBI to carry it out.
The representative of the Lowndes County Sheriff's office was not available to give us his opinion when we contacted him on Thursday.
A South Georgia judge ordered the authorities on Wednesday to hand over all video surveillance records that the investigators had examined.
The adolescent's parents said that they hoped that video images contained clues about the circumstances of his death.
The CDC publishes advice on allergies in children to schools
Wednesday, the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention published a series of guidelines on how to manage the food allergies of children at school.
This is the first set of guidelines published by the U.S. government, as the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies has increased sharply.
One in 20 children in the United States are suffering from food allergy today.
The CDC found that the prevalence of food allergies in children increased by 18 per cent between 1997 and 2007.
The guide contains information for schools on how to raise awareness among teachers and staff of food allergies in children, and how to treat them in cases of allergic reaction.
It also recommends that schools have a stock of epiphenephrine – the EpiPen brand self-injector being the most commonly used – to be able to react quickly in case of potentially deadly anaphylaxis.
The legislative assemblies of States have recently updated the regulations to make it easier for schools to have epinephrine in stock.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms reported by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children can say, "I feel like something is sticking to my language," "I feel like I have a hair on my tongue" or "I have pictations on my tongue."
The NSA case underlines the total lack of intelligence debate
How can we explain the contradictory attitude of the French government, who on the one hand made public in calling on the United States ambassador on 21 October, and the other forbids the overflight of the territory by the Bolivian presidential aircraft, on the basis of the rumor of presence on its board of Edward Snowden?
In my view, there are two levels of response from the French government.
When François Hollande calls Barack Obama or when Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius summons the US ambassador, they respond to a real discovery, which is the extent of US surveillance over all communications in France.
Is it not surprising to read in the columns of the World a few weeks apart from the reproduction of American diplomatic correspondence and a condemnation of the listenings of the Orsay Quay by the NSA?
Wouldn't it be like a wave of hypocrisy on your part?
The journalistic approach is not a moral positioning, but the search for the interest and relevance of information that allows every citizen to forge an opinion.
When WikiLeaks lifts the veil on the analysis by the American diplomacy of political or other issues around the world, we consider that, in the eyes of the American power, this is an important lighting.
When we describe U.S. interception systems against French diplomacy in the United States, it is in no way to be outraged by this practice, it is to describe the world as it is.
Has France received information from the NSA on terrorist operations aimed at our interests?
Can we avoid American collaboration?
The establishment of technology tools of interception that have been very powerful by the United States over the past ten years, but also by France, has been officially justified by the fight against terrorism.
In this area, France and the United States have, inter alia, set up procedures for cooperation and exchange of information almost daily and which are described on both sides as essential.
As an example, Mohammed Merah's presence in tribal areas in Miranshah was reported to the French through the NSA.
France can be led, for example, to transmit entire blocks of data on the Sahel region to American services, and, in return - it has already been said - the Americans can provide information to the French on other regions of the world.
So the fundamental issue behind this NSA case is not so much the ability or right of countries to develop interception tools, as the question of the total absence of pre-disclosure, particularly within Parliaments, on the justification of such systems, the perimeter that must be theirs, and ultimately the issue of violations of freedoms.
What do the United States really risk? a degradation of their image?
We can't tell them, I don't see how they can be punished.
The risk of Americans can be double.
The first is when their allies - and it has been recently - learn that their leaders, sometimes at the top of their state, have been monitored.
This is the case with Brazil and Germany, two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States have grown.
Another effect may be more economical: more and more European or South American companies are demanding, in the light of the revelations, to entrust their confidential data to American providers subject to American laws, and thus to the possession of the NSA.
Last thing: the vast movement of revelations undertaken by the media around the world, which helps to trigger a debate on intelligence surveillance practices up to now virtually non-existent, could move legislators, including Americans, to reconsider the powers they have given to their intelligence services.
Parents of intersexual children can choose "indeterminate sex"
Germany has become the first European nation to recognize a third sex for infants born with ambiguous sex organs.
The male or female sex of new births will no longer be assigned to them in a rigid manner at birth.
Under the new law, parents will no longer be required to report their child's sex, allowing them to register "indeterminate" or "unspecified" sex on their birth certificate.
The purpose of the law was to remove the pressure on the shoulders of parents who could make precipitated decisions on sexual reassignment surgery for their infants, and to combat discrimination against intersexual persons.
According to the BBC, an intersex person would have said years later, "I am neither a man nor a woman."
I will remain the patchwork that the doctors created, contusioned and swept away.
It is estimated that one child out of 2,000 born each year is not a boy or a girl.
They are intersexed, the intersexuality being part of the group of 60 diagnosed diseases as disorder of sexual development, a generic term identifying individuals with abnormally developed chromosomes or gonads (ovaries or testicles) or sexual organs.
Wallis Simpson could have been intersexed.
Sexual identification is still not well understood, but most specialists in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it is better to use the best information available to assign it, then wait for and follow the child's psychological and physical development before considering a surgical act, if any.
Dr. Jack Drescher, a New York psychiatrist and sex identification specialist, said the new German law "seems to be a good idea."
Intersexual children pose an ethical dilemma.
"Some people suffer from extremely serious diseases that require surgery, but this is not the case for most children," he added.
It is possible to make a sexual assignment without operation, and see how identity develops.
The science of how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very precise.
No one can answer the question of why this is happening.
It's like the mystery that surrounds homosexuals.
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described intersexual persons as different from transsexual or transgender persons, since their status is not related to sex but rather to their biological constitution, which is not exclusively that of a man or exclusively that of a woman, but is generally both at the same time and is not clearly defined as being one or the other.
These characteristics can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characters, (such as muscle mass, pilosity, chest and stature), primary sexual characters (such as reproductive organs and sexual organs) or chromosome structure and hormones.
The report also provided an overview of the discrimination faced by inter-sex and transgender persons in employment, as well as the extent of harassment and violence and prejudiced crimes.
Young non-conforming boys now have camps that are specially destined for them.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to register male, female or "third sex" on their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian, Norrie May-Welby, became the world's first person to have been recognized as "neutral" after winning the appeal trial that allows her to keep a "unspecified" sex alive.
German passports will have a third designation next to M or F – X for intersex, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still the subject of controversy, according to a report on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of legislators from this landly Catholic country signed a petition for the "gender theory" to be removed from school books.
The American Catholic Online site also opposed German law, writing that "since the world is dragged into a new realm where gender is a choice but where sexual activity is not one, two other pillars of civilization are reversed."
In Maryland, a baby's mother also stated on Baby Zone that she would prefer a sex to be attributed to babies at birth.
"The role of parent is sufficiently stressful without additional restrictions, especially if you do not know your child's sex," she said on the site for young parents.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born without male or female sexual organs were called hermaphrodites, according to the name of the magnificent Greek god who had a double sex.
And just ten years ago, the medical community considered the kind as a slate, which can be erased and on which one can redesign.
But now, many people question the ethical basis of surgery, knowing that sexual identity is complex and that sometimes doctors may be mistaken, not knowing how a child will feel about his or her sexual reassignment when he or she grows up.
"In the mid-20th century, this was called a psychiatric emergency," Drescher said.
When these children were born, they didn't call the psychiatrist, they called the surgeon.
The dominant theory on how to treat children with ambiguous sex organs was launched by Dr. John Money, Johns-Hopkins University, who considered the gender to be malleable.
He used the term "sexual identity" and argued that social and environmental signals – the way parents raise a child – interact with a child's genes and hormones to shape it to be identified as male or female sex.
But in a 1966 case, known as John/John, his theories led to controversy.
He had advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been cut down during a broken circumcision to have him castrated entirely, also removing the testicles, and raising him like a daughter.
"Money presented this as a successful transition case, but that was not the case," Drescher said.
At about 15 years of age, he became a boy again and married a woman.
But at 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors "always repeat this model."
But in the 1990s with the arrival of the Internet, those who survived these sex change operations say "that they are not satisfied with the result."
This is the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male XY chromosomes but ambiguous sex organs.
The doctors could not really tell whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never have a "satisfying life" as a man.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce suffered surgical ablation of the external organ and testicles and was raised as a girl.
He was given female hormones at the age of 12.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he said on ABCNews.com.
I wasn't happy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he had a vaginoplasty.
But depressed and aware that something was wrong, he asked for his medical file.
What he discovered horrified him.
I was sterilized at birth – and no one had ever told me.
Bruce was born with a disorder of sexual development (DDS) that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone to allow his sexual organs to develop.
After learning the truth, he became a man again, following a testosterone treatment and had his breast removed.
The surgery made her sterile.
Today, he defends the cause of others in an organization called Interface Project, which tries to normalize the perception of intersexuals.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, director general of the non-profit organization based in California Lawyers for Informed Choice, fears that German law "calls for labelling and stigmatization".
"Many activists are concerned that the German law encourages parents to make quick decisions and give their child "indetermined" sex," she said.
We are afraid that she will encourage the interventions.
We think it would be better to assign a male or female sex, and wait.
But we have not seen what the law was going to give, so we can only proceed with assumptions.
Tamar-Mattis stated that his organization supported Australian law because it "allows adults to choose to be recognized under the term "third sex".
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about a legal kind," she added.
German law concerns the attribution of sex at birth.
It is not a battle that young children should wage at that age.
When they grow up, they will be able to make decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a radiologist who specializes in mammography in Pittsburgh, whose daughter is affected by a disorder of sexual development and who helps thousands of people in a support group, said that the German law "will take responsibility" for parents and children.
Dr. Baratz's daughter Katie was born with male chromosomes, but she suffers from a DDS called complete androgenic insensitivity syndrome.
Due to the failure of its androgen receptors, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.
Today, 29-year-old Katie is married and interns in childhood psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is sterile, she hopes to have children through adoption services or carrying mothers.
"The law leaves parents a certain latitude so that they do not have to make hasty decisions," said Baratz.
This leaves them time to do certain tests and understand them, and a time before they register "male" or "female".
So everything goes well – you can raise your child and love him.
You have a beautiful baby and enjoy being a relative.
You don't have to rush for an irreversible surgery.
"This puts children at the heart of the decision and reduces the feeling of anxiety that motivates parents because they are afraid of not doing the right thing," she said.
Finally, the child will decide with what sex he/she feels the most comfortable – and it's something great.
This allows the child to make the decision for himself.
Letta Trusts in the Longer Life of Her Government
The President of the Italian Council Enrico Letta judges that his government will continue until 2015 despite the strong tension between left and right within the ruling coalition in the approach of the Senate's vote to cast Silvio Berlusconi off his mandate.
In an interview with the daily La Stampa, the left-centre leader said he had "holds the intention" to continue ruling with his coalition until the upcoming legislative elections in 2015.
The upper chamber of the Italian Parliament will meet in the course of the month to decide on the fate of the former President of the Council who was convicted of tax fraud in August.
Silvio Berlusconi threatens to withdraw his support from the government if the Senate, where it has more opponents than supporters, pronounces its dismissal.
But part of his camp, grouped around the national secretary of the People of Freedom (PDL) Angelino Alfano, continues to support the government, as demonstrated last October 2nd his refusal to give in to Berlusconi's injunctions that he already wished to bring down the cabinet.
The L.A. Times reports that an American Transportation Safety Agency, TSA, and a suspect were injured during the firefight exchange.
Firefighters called at the locations of the drama claimed to have responded to a call referring to "mitigated multiples".
"The forces of order are on site," says the airport on its Twitter account, while TV images showed people evacuated in ambulances.
"There was a shooting," said AFP, a spokesperson for the US Transport Safety Agency (TSA).
The local antenna of ABC showed a person evacuated on a broom, and a second transported on a wheelchair.
The incident took place around 9:30 a.m. in Montreal at terminal 3 of the airport, also specified the airport.
The Los Angeles Times states that the two and three Tribunals are in the process of being evacuated.
The TSA spokesperson was unable to confirm immediately that one of its employees was injured.
All flights on arrival and departure from the airport were suspended.
The Israeli army kills a Hamas member in Gaza-cess
On Thursday, Israeli tanks shot a Palestinian Islamist Hamas activist and seriously injured another in the south of the Gaza Strip, were learned from sources of health services.
A source from Hamas explained that fighting broke out in that area, as Israeli tanks crossed the border and were targeted by your Palestinian mortars.
The Israeli army merely referred to a "targeted action" in the area near a tunnel called "terrorist" by the Hebrew state, dug up at the border and whose discovery was announced mid-October.
Report: Obama's campaign considered Biden dropping for Hillary Clinton
The closest advisors to President Barack Obama have, in the greatest secret, planned to replace Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 list, according to the New York Times.
This revelation is the most significant event that appears in the very expected book of Mark Halperin's 2012 campaign and John Heilemann, "Double Down: Game Change 2012".
The Times obtained a copy of the book to be issued and reported Thursday evening that the president's close collaborators had carried out "in-depth work in groups and surveys at the end of 2011" to see if Biden's avoidance could help Obama for his re-election while his hopes were fading.
According to Times Jonathan Martin's policy correspondent, the book offers a detailed analysis of the work of the senior campaigners and the White House, namely the former Secretary General of the White House Bill Daley, to measure how the replacement of the Vice-President by the former Secretary of State Clinton might have on the vote.
The possibility of an exchange is a secret that has been languished within Chicago's campaign QG and within the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen close advisors from the president – including Daley, the former campaign leader of Obama Jim Messina and the former advisors at the White House David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew that the change was under study.
"Double Down" indicates that Daley took the charge to replace Biden, despite their "close personal ties," before finally deciding against change when the figures showed Clinton on the presidential list "did not significantly improve the chances of Obama's success."
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
"I said I had examined a whole series of questions, and that was one of them," Daley told the newspaper.
Remember, at that time, the president was in no shape, and so it was said, "Lord, what can we do?".
As Daley called the "cooperative" exam, Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that the re-election campaign had invested a lot to find out if the change would be beneficial during the election.
"The campaigns do not spend a lot of money on polls and discussion groups unless they seriously consider taking action," said Martin on AC360.
However, it is not known whether Obama was aware that his team was looking at the replacement.
Martin told CNN that he had asked Daley if his boss was aware of any change.
Although Daley said he did not think that the president "was aware" of any change, the former Secretary General admitted that it was "possible" that Obama knew.
Martin added that "Double Down" did not definitely respond to the question of whether the political polls had arrived at Obama's office.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought that Obama did not know that Biden's ban on the presidential list was being examined.
"Perhaps," answered Martin.
You want a fluo ice?
A British entrepreneur created the first fluorescent ice in the jelly-based world.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a bright snack.
He had the idea after reading a study on jellyfish and convinced Chinese scientists to chemically recreate the brilliant protein.
Ice cream reacts with the tongue by increasing the protein's pH to make it shine.
Chris explains that, since ice cream starts to glow when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, the more we lick, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the ice company "Lick Me I'm Delicious", said: "It's something incredible, but we're still only at the beginning in terms of production, and 2 g of this thing costs about £200."
The protein we use in the ice reacts with the language at neutral pH.
So when your mouth warms up the protein, the pH level increases and the ice starts to shine.
We have tested it in the past few months and it seemed appropriate to share it with everyone at Halloween's time because it has an extraordinary brilliant effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice I've created because the lightness of the jellyfish is four times more expensive than the gold.
So each ball costs me about £ 140.
But she tastes rather!
Charlie's experimental-based company, based in Bristol, is known for its unusual ice-cream fragrances such as beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his next creation is even more ambitious.
He added: "I really want to develop an invisible ice."
It's inherently impossible because of the refraction caused by ice crystals that constitute ice cream, but I think I'll find a way to get there.
The ice uses the fluorescent properties of the jellyfish synthesized by Chinese scientists.
Lou Reed died during a tai chi session
The singer Lou Reed died while doing tai chi exercises, revealed on Thursday his wife Laurie Anderson in a letter published by the regional newspaper "East Hampton Star" to the residents of the city of Springs, where the couple had a home.
The artist died last Sunday, at the age of 71.
"He died on Sunday morning, as he looked at the trees and performed the famous 21st movement of tai chi, with his hands as a musician who broke the air," says Laurie Anderson.
Lou Reed was master tai chi, a Chinese martial art.
The singer's wife also explained that she had promised her husband the week before she died to get him out of the hospital and take him to their house in Springs (Long Island).
Lou and I have spent a lot of time here in recent years.
And even though we are citizens, it is our spiritual home.
"Lou was a prince and a fighter, and I know that his songs about the pain and beauty of the world will transmit to many people the tremendous joy of living that he had," she adds.
Lou Reed had undergone a liver graft last May.
Halloween 2013 : In figures
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, go to bed late and dress us to go to the neighborhood.
Today, I've become more lazy.
Over the past two years, I have not distributed a single candy, and I certainly will not do it any more this year.
But the states show that I'm the Galician sheep when we talk about Halloween.
Most Americans – 158 million of them actually – will celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 million in candy, disguises and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.
What I look forward to at every Halloween party is trends.
The disguises should represent $1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, inanimate sexy objects are furious.
Women no longer need to be sexy professionals; they can also be sexy food such as pizzas, hamburgers and carrots.
As for men, I expect to see many zombies, thanks to the TV series The Walking Dead, and I bet that the men of Daft Punk's space will be among our Instagram photos this year.
According to Google, the most sought after disguises are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there's nothing wrong with staying traditional.
We disguised our dogs last year and, to my great surprise, they weren't the only ones.
In fact, Americans are spending $330 million in animal disguises this year, according to the NRF.
It makes a lot of curious dogs dressed in hotdogs.
When it comes to candy, we don't gland.
The Americans will spend $1.9 million in candy this year, according to the Nielsen firm.
This represents about 272 million pounds of Hershey bars, suceptes, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark bars.
This is a great news for the 41 million children who go hunting candy in their neighborhood, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.
In fact, we will buy and, we don't tell stories, consume 41 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
The corn candy are the only thing we don't want to eat; and yet almost 16 million kg are sold for Halloween, according to the National Manufacturers Association.
This represents about 9 billion corn grains.
It is a mystery that I have not yet come to clarify.
Nothing is more representative of Halloween than haunted houses.
They have the best names, such as "Terror Behind the Walls" (which is actually a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
In fact, there are 1,200 haunted houses officially recognized in the United States, which generate about $500 million in revenues, according to the Haunts America, and this includes these wonderful pictures of you pissing on that your friends put on Facebook and you can't remove and on which a guy you like leaves a comment of the "beautiful head" style.
Finally, let's talk about citrus fruit.
Charlie Brown introduced us to La Grosse Citrouille when we were kids, and sculpting a lantern-shaped lemon, it's like decorating a Christmas tree – it's something we've been doing since we've been a kid.
Fortunately for us, the "baby-citrol tendency" began only last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us carved these potions and did not have to sit in.
This year, the Americans will spend approximately $106 million on citrus fruits, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The sunglasses that quietly flirt on the porch of your home probably came from Illinois, where 542 million lemons were grown this year.
If you are looking to show yourself more, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and try to sculpt their 922 kg tank.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will create an internal fault structure ("bad bank") comprising 38 billion pounds (45 billion euros) of the most risky assets, a measure aimed at expanding its relations with London and accelerating its reprivatisation.
The bank wants to reduce from 55% to 70% the proportion of suspicious assets in its balance sheet in the next two years and hopes to have completely cleaned it in the three years.
RBS also said it would include a provision for depreciation of the additional suspicious receivables of four to 4.5 billion pounds over the quarter, a written statement related to the constitution of the canton structure.
RBS also stated that this internal restructuring would free 10 to 11 billion pounds of capital, thus strengthening its capacity to lend.
The Bank and London pointed out that the "bad bank" would allow for a feature of the past, with the government in particular being accused of interfering with the management of RIBs.
"We can now go ahead, worry about the future and about 90% of the assets that make up a really good bank and build a large bank for the clientele and the United Kingdom," said new Director General Ross McEwan to the press.
Land Rover announces its sponsorship of a series of rallies
The interior has 6 stitch seat and harness belts, as well as an Intercom system.
The options include improved brakes, a service providing access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistics support and vehicle storage between two events.
Drew Bowler, CEO of Bowler Motorsport said: "The rallyers who join Bowler have changed."
They are not all experienced, some seek excitement and adventure and realistic access to international events.
We are truly happy to offer such an approach in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA, and we are convinced that this will be a new way of trying at various forms of rally in the United Kingdom and the international, and preparing for the rigors and realities of raid rallying.
We had a lot of fun to develop the vehicle of the Defender Challenge – the championship is really going to be exciting.”
In addition, the Defender Challenge will offer a day of training and testing in February and the opportunity to participate in events in the deserts of North Africa and the Middle East.
Firefighters were called to help a lost puppy after being stuck 15 m above the ground on an unstable corniche in a career
Ruby, a cocker Spaniard, had escaped after a traffic accident without gravity.
She was identified three days later by a person who walked her dog stuck in the career
The firemen came down to remember along the cliff to recover the dog and save it from a certain death
A puppy had the chance to escape the worst after the firemen were called to recover it safely while it was perched 15 m above the ground on the unstable sole of a cliff.
Ruby, a 9-month-old cocker Spaniard, escaped after an accident on the road on Sunday afternoon and survived for three days alone before being saved in a career on Wednesday.
His owners, Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20 years old, went to Flappit's career in Denholme in West Yorkshire to find Ruby and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Relief Service.
They had desperately sought their lost dog and launched a call on social media sites after it disappeared in the career after an accident without gravity.
Around 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a sharp-eyed person who walked his dog noticed Ruby on a corner in the career, stuck 15 m above the ground.
A technical relief team from Cleckheaton's firehouse ran over the premises and descended in reminder to save Ruby using an animal cider to carry her to the top of the cliff.
Technical Relief Specialist Andy Clayton said, "She was in a precarious situation."
It was in the middle of the cliff, 15 m from the top and 15 m from the ground.
She absolutely did not move during the rescue – she was frozen.
But she's fine now.
She ate biscuits after.
It was a very unusual call.
It's incredible that someone noticed the dog.
The technical relief specialist Peter Lau said: "R Ruby was very lucky to get rid of it."
She could have been seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was conducted at the veterinarian for control; his general condition was satisfactory, apart from exhaustion and dehydration.
Ms. Hall, from Halifax in West Yorkshire, said, "I was terrified of watching the rescue."
I didn't think she was up there at first.
It was amazing to have him back in her arms.
The veterinarian said that if she had been too exhausted and had fainted, she would probably have fallen.
The firefighters were awesome.
What they did was really brave.
We are so grateful to them, each of them has been absolutely wonderful.
Mr. Alderson of Keighley added: "We were afraid she would fall but she did not move."
The firefighters were great.
I can't believe she was up there.
Mick Jagger says he never dredged Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview with an Australian radio show this week, pop star said she was a chorister on Jagger's "Old Habits Die Hard" song in 2004.
Perry said she had dinner with the rock veteran and explained, "He dredged me when I was 18."
She added, "It was a long time ago, and it was very nice."
In a statement on Thursday, a 70-year-old representative of Jagger said that he categorically denied making advances to Katy Perry.
The representative added: "Maybe she confuses him with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers to make an appearance on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
His new album, "Prism", landed in the first place of the charts this week.
Beijing called into question a Turkmen Islamic Movement
"The backstage support for the attack came from the Islamic Movement of East Turkestan based in Central and Western Asia," said the boss of Chinese security bodies to a Hong Kong television channel, according to an online video Thursday evening on a website.
Meng Jianzhu, who is a member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party (PCC), expressed himself in Tashkent during an official visit to Uzbekistan.
This is the first time that a Chinese official designates a particular organization after the Monday attack.
According to the Chinese police, three Ouígours of the same Muslim-dominated family in Xinjiang, bordering several Central Asian countries, rushed their car loaded with gasoline drums against the entry of the banned city in Beijing, in a suicide attack that caused two deaths and 40 injuries.
The driver of the car, his wife and his mother died in the car fire.
The Etim, who declared himself to fight for the independence of East Turkestan, the former name of Chinese Xinjiang, was classified by the United Nations in 2002 among the organizations affiliated with Al-Qaeda.
This movement is often designated by the Chinese authorities as responsible for sporadic disorders in Xinjiang, but its real influence is questioned by several experts.
George Kerevan: The outbreak of Europe gives the Scots a choice
Another day, another worrying story of independence.
This time, we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the European free movement zone in order to join the EU.
And here we hear stories of passport control in Berwick and a border of barbed wires along the wall of Hadrian.
While it is true that the Strathclyde newspaper indicated the possible economic benefits of greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe, this was not included in the major titles (and was to be expected).
Nor has anyone said that EU Member States spend much of their time bypassing their formal rules when it sets them up.
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area at the moment, a continuing non-compliance with the rules would be a thin concession that Brussels could offer in return for everything it wants to get from the Scots.
So it's a story that's not one of them.
And a story so ancient that it is now fixed: I heard for the first time the bobard that "independence means passport control" over 40 years ago.
Yet we have forgotten an interesting point in this interpretation of an old dusty tale.
Why should an independent Scotland follow Europe's instructions, in fact?
Why exchange the London yoke against that of Brussels, especially now?
Here is the real news about Europe: the major post-war plan to unify Europe is definitely at the point of death.
With the euro crisis, the Project Europe has officially died.
Throughout Europe, parties opposing the EU or fighting for the abandonment of the euro as a common currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the Euroseptic Alternative Party for Germany, founded only this year and arrived nowhere, gathered almost five million votes during the federal elections in September and released the Liberal Democratic Party (equivalent to our Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been a national opposition to the project to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has marked a turning point.
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, associated with the Carcan weighs on national economies through accession to the single currency, has led many people to believe that the European Project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has not much to do with national governments that have excessive budget deficits – it was only true for Greece.
Instead, the European system has placed favourable exchange rates on its members for German exporters – what German politicians want to maintain.
Without the possibility of evaluating the national currency, the countries of southern Europe face an intrinsic productivity problem with Germany.
The only remedy is to make dark cuts in wages and public spending – encouraged by Berlin.
Beyond the current budgetary and monetary problems, there is a deeper difficulty in productivity in Europe.
Following the 'green' energy policies imposed by Brussels – which are a reason to subsidize French and German energy companies at the consumer's expense – the European industry pays twice more for electricity and four times more for gas than the United States.
This is a redehibitory disadvantage in terms of costs, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All the world's wage freezes will not prevent the European petrochemical industry from being penalized by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, the revolt, particularly in France, is one of the great leaders of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite considered the EU a means of controlling Germany and putting Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport for its political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy in Europe, leaving the French economy to fail.
As a result, Marine Le Pen's extreme right-wing party, the anti-European National Front, has just won a crucial partial election, returning socialists to power in third place.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the votes – a timely warning for the British Labour Party, which reminds it that it cannot start from the principle that a split of the right will automatically promote the left.
What does Marine Le Pen do with its new popularity with the French white working class?
It wants to use next year's European elections to create a single anti-money bloc within the European Parliament.
If the anti-European parties were a good example in these elections, which is very possible, such a bloc could control the European Parliament for the first time.
Here's what I think: very soon, the anti-European and anti-money sentiment unique in Europe will unite and end up killing the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will return to something that will more like "the (Sovereign) Europe" free privileged by General Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economies could retain the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currency.
I expect the United Kingdom to distance itself from this project, and I hope that it will make its eyes soft in the United States.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left behind in the Atlantic.
What about Scotland?
We can decide to be a region of small England (mainly).
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which includes sending us to promote Berlin and Brussels.
I believe that Scotland could accommodate a more freer European agreement, provided that we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other countries with similar views would be easier in a non-Federal Europe.
Otherwise, we should imitate Norway and retain our economic independence.
The SNP government of Scotland is – and it is worth noting – the anti-austerity political movement that has the best success in Europe, since it won a spectacular majority in 2011 based on its opposition to the proposed dark cuts (and implemented) by the Chancellor of the Labour Rider, Alistair Darling, and the conservative/liberal-democrat coalition that followed.
It would be ridiculous now for Scotland to vote for independence if it was to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Live early
Studies show that African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty age earlier than white girls.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is imminent
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that the obesity epidemic could be a trigger for early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is not as pronounced in boys
CNN Pat Etheridge's former correspondent is a journalist who specializes in family and child health issues.
Does a mother have to worry if her daughter's pubic breasts and hair begin to grow to 7 or 8 years old?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics held this week in Orlando, Florida, Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, pedo-endocrinologist, explained that these early physical changes are quite common among young Americans and represent a new standard.
"I spend a lot of time reassuring parents – generally, it doesn't mean a rapid shift towards full puberty," said Kaplowitz.
The obvious signs of development, such as breast budding, under-arm hair and in the pubic area and body odors, appear earlier among girls.
But there has been only a slight advance in the age of the first rules over the last four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12 and a half years, while the average age was 12 and a quarter in 1970.
"Once the chest has begun to develop, it takes at least two or three years before the first rules appear," said Kaplowitz, also the author of "Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem".
Time is the most accurate test for how puberty will evolve.
There is a debate about what constitutes the real appearance of puberty, but it is considered "early" when breast development is accompanied by sudden growth before the age of 8.
In most cases, development slows or stops – it is something a pediatrician can follow closely.
A faster evolution may justify tests carried out by an endocrinoologist to eliminate serious problems such as tumours or cysts.
Treatments exist to delay the emergence of the first rules and prevent other consequences: premature bone aging that can slow growth and small size at adulthood.
Recommendations for medical and hormonal treatment are based on child age, development rate, growth rate and emotional maturity.
The psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is careful with drugs but recognizes that "controlling puberty can mitigate certain behavioural problems and the feeling for girls to be different from others."
The other major problem is understandable: Parents simply do not want their very young girls to have their rules.
"They fear the risk of pregnancy or even the way they will manage hygiene issues," said Kaplowitz.
"It was a shock," recalls a woman whose daughter had her first rules at 10 years of age.
Even if there were signs and we talked about the rules, it was not emotionally prepared.
She came home from the frightened and troubled school to be the first of her friends.
There are many theories available to the public about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no consistent theory that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sex messages from the media are responsible.
Boys, like girls, reach puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz claims that the most credible hypothesis is that of the obesity epidemic.
He participated in a study of girls aged 6-9 years who linked the percentage of fat to puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other influential factors.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty age earlier than white girls.
There are various explanations.
Globally, early puberty mechanisms seem to be influenced by everything, from economic to climate, through genes.
Another problem: Although boys have hair on the face and in the younger pubic area, the trend towards real early puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors participating in the APA conference stressed the complexity of the subject.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common, even among infants and toddlers.
"We need to be careful about how we identify the real appearance of puberty," said Lawrence Silverman, a pedo-endocrinologist working at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to ask their pediatrician for advice on how to talk to their child.
"This may mean having a conversation earlier than expected," explained Kaplowitz.
If you stay calm, your child will react well in general.
Girls whose early puberty must be reassured that, even when it happens earlier than expected, the process is part of life.
The tribute to the folk of the Coen brothers
"Inside Llewyn Davis" by the Coen brothers, Grand Prix of the last Cannes Festival, is a nostalgic and funny film on the 1961 Greenwich village and folk music that just started to resonate there, before Bob Dylan arrived.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose film has just been the subject of a retrospective to the French Cinematèque, had cooled the Palme d'or in Cannes in 1991 for Barton Fink.
In the absence of being able to hire Dylan or the trio Peter, Paul and Mary, Joel and Ethan Coen threw their money on the star of American cinema, Oscar Isaac, 33, but also on the planetial star Justin Timberlake.
In this humorous movie where music is a central character and live songs, Oscar Isaac reveals himself as a accomplished folk musician and singer, while Timberlake, his friend in the film, leaves the pop for folk music with a contagious retirement.
As for Carey Mulligan, she left the rich surroundings of Daisy Mulligan in "Gatsby the Magnificent" for less shiny clothes, a sweet voice when she sings, but the interest she owes to the machine gun when she speaks.
"Inside Llewyn Davis" tells about a week the troubles of a folk singer who can't catch up and get angry with the whole earth.
It accepts back-up replacements at the feet raised in the studios.
Without accommodation, he toured the couches of his friends who still want to receive him.
A documentary air
"His relationship with success is tortured, that's what we were interested in: a mixture of bad luck, a guy who's not there at the right time, who's not a carrierist but an integrityist, with self-destructive behaviour," said Ethan Coen, crowned with his brother Joel several Oscars and prized in Cannes.
If Llewyn Davis didn't exist, the two filmmakers folk music fans built their story on real personalities of the time like folk musician Dave Von Ronk.
The idea was to show the moment before the advent of Greenwich village, this New York neighborhood called to become "the epicenter of the rise of folk music that would generate international stars" as journalist Elijah Wald, friend of Van Ronk, wrote.
The film then takes documentaries allure, the 33T inundated dusty music label sold by an unbeatable old secretary, the musical choices of the studios of the time and the cafes where the singers were produced.
The magic of the Coen brothers still works by integrating a funny character that passes through the movie permanently: a beautiful red cat in the crack eyes, along with Llewyn Davis' fortune companion.
Questioned about the way he composed his character, the actor and singer Justin Timberlake recalled that he had "larged in Tennessee, bathed by blues and country".
"My first music lessons were given to me by my grandfather who taught me how to play guitar," he added.
For Justin Timberlake, if the work is necessary to "be considered good", "the chance can also start someone's career", and "more and more today".
Like Llewyn Davis who refuses to compromise on his music, the pop star explains that in a career, "the most important thing is not to let oneself be trapped by everything that can prevent us from expressing ourselves."
Gérard de Villiers, the author of "SAS", died.
He's never heard of retirement.
Phenomenon of the French edition, Gérard de Villiers, who died on Thursday at 83 years of age, just published his 200th SAS, "Vengeance du Kremlin".
In February, the New York Times dedicated it as "the author of espionage novels who knew too much."
He had just spent ten days in Afghanistan, a theatre of the 198 and 199th opus of the famous series of espionage novels.
Reduced physically by a very serious heart accident in December 2010, he was travelling on this trip with a walker.
And before Afghanistan, he also left for Libya, Russia, Lebanon and Mali.
With four SAS published per year, Gérard de Villiers, born December 8, 1929 in Paris, made sure to ignore the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the publication of "SAS in Istanbul", the first in the series, nearly half a century ago.
"Surely between 120 million and 150 million all countries confused," he went on last March.
His Burmese cat on the knees, in the living room of his immense apartment of a building on Foch Avenue just a step away from the Arc de Triomphe, the evil eye under his white hair, he mentioned some of the languages in which the adventures of SAS were translated: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Japanese or Korean.
"Not to mention pirated editions," he added, designating a stack of books on the low table between the bronzes or ivory reported from the 130 arpent countries to place its novels there.
For the price of a pack of cigarettes, the reader is entitled to the traditional cover with the photo of a young woman to the advantageous chest, carrying a gun or assault rifle.
Inside, his serene highness (SAS) Prince Malko Linge, an aristocrat of disarranged Austrian and contract agent of the CIA to pay for the repairs of the family castle, throws himself into the boxes of all the wicked of the earth, communists of the 1970s and 80s, then jihadists from the 1990s.
In each book, the same recipe: a large dose of geopolitics and exoticism, some scenes of hard sex, a zest of violence and torture.
"I never pretended to be a literary author," Gérard de Villiers explained.
I regard myself as a storyteller who writes to distract people to whom I do not send a message.
He was working "like the great reporters of pre-war, Albert London, who went on site and came back with real and long investigations."
SAS's father said, "make a kind of geopolitical leaf."
"I am constantly my files (Afghanistan, Syria, ...) before leaving," added Gérard de Villiers.
On the spot, I meet journalists, including AFP journalists, diplomats, people I have known for some twenty or thirty years.
As a result, many of its SASs are often pre-monitoring: thus, a month before the attack of a command center of the Syrian regime that killed several senior officials, he had told the story in "The Way of Damascus".
In "Les Fous de Benghazi", he had been the first to reveal the existence of a secret command centre of the CIA in this city, the cradle of the Libyan revolt.
In 1980, he staged the assassination of Egyptian President Anouar El-Sadate in "The Conspiracy of Cairo", a year before the attack.
In October 2012, in "Panique à Bamako", he reported the 4X4 columns of jihadists that were based on the Malian capital.
I am not becoming, was defending Gérard de Villiers, I merely make assumptions from countries that I know well and, from time to time, some of my assumptions come true.
After these trips to frequently troubled areas, he settled for a month behind his marguerite IBM writing machine dating from 1976 "all the pieces have been changed".
300 pages later, he wrote the word "FIN" and corrected each page in the pen.
AK-47 assault rifles, erotic photos and pictures of the author with African war lords are attached to the walls of his office.
Regularly pinned for machismo by feminist leagues and for racism by human rights organizations, Gérard de Villiers ruled out these accusations in two sentences.
Some women are sexual objects in my books but others are beautiful, intelligent and courageous women.
I am always welcome in Africa, where I have a lot of readers.
Gérard de Villiers said, "Malko Linge, like all heroes, is not old."
He won't die, and he won't retire.
No more than me.
Airplanes complain about the width of seats while large orders are in play
The dispute rages among the great aeronautical manufacturers about the width of the tourist class seats on long-sleeve flights, opening the way to bitter confrontation at the Dubai air show that takes place this month.
The conflict relates to the width of the seats proposed on long-distance flights to passengers of the economic class – which are not always the shortest by airlines, but to which the space allocated is essential to increase efficiency gains in the latest aircraft submitted by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week, Airbus called on the aeronautical industry to set up a standard imposing a seat size of at least 18 inches (45.72 cm) in economic classes, but his major American rival Boeing said it should be for airlines to decide.
The dispute broke out when the aircraft were looking to sell even larger versions of their bimotor long-sleeved aircraft, possibly expecting a record of orders during the event that will take place from 17 to 21 November.
The way in which the seats will be placed at the rear of the plane – in particular, there will be 9 or 10 front seats – is essential for the economic performance of the "mini-jumbo" segment.
Boeing states that its remodeled "777X" will accommodate 406 people in more than 17-inch seats, and will be configured with 10 seats per row.
Airbus indicates that the competitive version of its A350 will carry 350 people in 18-inch seats in rows of 9.
Aeronautics giants often exchange blows on technical issues by advertising in the professional press.
Today, Airbus calls directly to the public before the Dubai Airbus, where the 777X should take the step on its competitors with more than 100 orders.
We recently realized what could be the beginning of a new advertising war with the presentation to finance of a photo showing three people against each other at the restaurant, entitled "Would you accept that?".
"Boeing offers long-distance flights in closer seats than in regional turbo-fuel aircraft," said John Leahy, Commercial Director of Airbus.
As eating habits change, people grow, but seats in planes have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when Boeing's Jumbo 747 defined the modern long-course journey, and the turn of the century, the weight of the average American from 40 to 49 years increased by 10%, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health.
The average American size tour of the twenty-first century is 39.7 inches, according to American health statistics.
Airbus states that his rival adheres to a seat concept that dates back to the 1950s, when the circumference of the newly named jet set was narrower.
Airbus adds that it commissioned a study that indicates that an additional inch at the seat width would improve sleep quality by 53%.
Boeing contests Airbus's figures with regard to the width of seats and states that it is not for manufacturers to decide how airlines balance ticket prices and equipment.
He also said that the study shows that cabin experience does not depend only on the width of seats.
"It's really about bringing flexibility to airlines and allowing them to do what they think they need to do to carry out their activities," said Kent Craver, in charge of passenger satisfaction at Boeing.
They don't want to be told what will allow them to be profitable.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers it is more about having a certain freedom of movement, but for suppliers it is increasingly a question that could affect their results.
Behind the dispute, there is a race to aircraft orders for an estimated amount of at least $700 million at the market price in the coming decades, sufficient to have the balance of US and European exports reviewed.
As Reuters indicated for the first time in July, the configuration of seats is exactly what feeds the battle between the last devices.
Airbus and Boeing both claim a performance per seat in their latest models of 20 per cent long-duration bimotors above that of the market leader in this segment, the Boeing 777-300ER of 365 seats.
Boeing's performance depends in part on the comparison between 777X configured with 10 seats per row and a 777 original model configured in rows of 9.
The unit cost gain is low compared to the device configured with 10 seats per row currently in service.
"Boeing is doing this in order to get more seats and make its aircraft more competitive by reporting to our products," said Kevin Keniston, Director of Comfort Passenger at the European Airbus plane.
On the other hand, analysts say that cabins with 10 seats per row in the existing 777 suggest that many passengers vote in favour of a denser configuration, which can go in pairs with cheaper rates.
"An 18-inch seat width would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that, from a commercial point of view, Airbus's proposal is motivated by the threat of 777," said the expert inside Mary Kirby, the founder and editor-in-chief of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but offer a catalogue of suppliers among which airlines must choose.
The aircraft vendors who tour the world take even with them a meter to check the competing configurations.
While offering comfortable appliances, all manufacturers also offer high-density aircraft configurations to low-cost airlines and to regional travel.
Airbus offers an A350 configured with 10 seats per row but indicates that it has not yet sold it.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the need for greater customization of cabins by offering larger seats on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other large modern large aircraft manufacturer, experts say that it is unlikely that his call to the aeronautical industry will be possible to put in place a standard of size for the seats, but that he might forget about the 777X sales wave.
Oracle shareholders irritated by Ellison's salary
A majority of Oracle shareholders voted Thursday against the compensation proposal for the founder and CEO Larry Ellison, in view of the financial performance of his group.
The vote is not binding but comes close to the image of Larry Ellison, the third world fortune just aurulated from the victory of his boat at the Cup of America.
The billionaire still owns 25% of the capital of the software group he co-founded 40 years ago.
Last year Ellison had voted negative on his remuneration.
Oracle's boss gave up a $1.2 million bonus for the 2013 fiscal year ended in May due to the poor performance of the group, which missed its growth goals, but he collected about $77 million related to stock options.
His fixed salary is only for a symbolic dollar.
Over the year 2013 the net profit of Oracle increased by 3.5% while the stock exchange rate by 27.5%, exceeding the S&P-500 index that took 24% at the same time.
The new nicotine vaccine could remove the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotin vaccine that could remove the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
Only one dose of the vaccine was able to protect the mice from nicotine dependence.
Other tests are needed before the human being tests begin, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical College in New York stated that the first signs were encouraging.
"We really hope that this kind of vaccination strategy will help millions of smokers who have tried to stop, exhausting all the methods available today on the market, but discover that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches," said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains an harmless virus that has been modified to transport the genetic information needed to design anti-nicotin antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then start producing a regular flow of antibodies.
The antibodies trace all of the nicotine molecules present in the blood system and neutralize them before they reach the brain, which prevents the smoker from having its dose of nicotine.
In tests, the vaccinated mice to whom nicotine was subsequently given continued their activity normally.
But the mice who had not been vaccinated "were calmed," said the researchers, sign that nicotine had reached their brain.
Experiences are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines were found to be ineffective because they contained antibodies.
Injections had to be repeated so often so that antibody levels remained high that they were too expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower because it transforms liver cells into antibodies.
Professor Crystal said that if the future vaccine for human use was completely safe, it could be given to children before they are tempted to try a cigarette, which would prevent any addition to nicotine.
But it is more likely that it will be used by smokers who want to stop smoking.
"They will know that if they start again smoking, they will take no pleasure in it because of the nicotine vaccine, and this will help them to lose their bad habit," he added.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but reported that much more thorough research was needed.
The Chief of the Pakistani Taliban killed by a drone
The leader of the Pakistani Taliban movement, Hakimulah Mehsud, was killed in a hit by an American drone on Friday in Pakistan, and was heard from security services.
The death of Hakimullah Mehsud has been announced several times in the past.
But intelligence officials, the army, as well as the activist movement said this time that he had lost his life in this strike, led in the North Waziristan region.
"We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a drone shot," said a senior security officer.
On the eve, Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, on his way to London, had informed the British government that discussions had been held with the Pakistani Taliban (TTP) Tehrik and Taliban (TTP).
Tripodi refuse to be influenced by Obeid
The former Labour Minister of New South Wales Joe Tripodi will be investigated by the State Anti-Corruption Regulator.
The former Minister of New South Wales Joe Tripodi denied having changed the commercial lease policy at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three property located in the government-controlled area.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation to see if Mr.Obeid had pressured several state ministers to renew its leases in Circular Quay, where the Obeid owns two restaurants and a coffee, after their expiration in August 2005, without any invitation to tender.
She now investigates allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr.Obeid's secret interest in these properties, following the testimony of Mr. Tripodi's former Under-Secretary-General, Lynne Ashpole, on Thursday.
During the years of discussions that began in 2005, the government pressured the leases to be offered.
The tenants were against and also wanted longer durations.
In 2009, Circular Quay's leases, which related to the Obeid approximately $2.5 million a year, were renewed without any invitation to tender.
Mr. Tripodi, Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, initially supported calls for tenders.
But he refused to change his policy at the request of Mr.Obeid, who, he recognized Mr. Tripodi, called for a change in government policy on leases.
The transcription of telephone conversations presented at ICA showed appeals made in August and September 2007 between Mr.Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had arrived at the Department of Ports after working under the orders of Mr.Obeid at the Department of Fisheries.
"Was the topic discussed during these telephone conversations the development of the commercial lease policy?" asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy to Mr. Tripodi.
"No," replied Mr. Tripodi.
I don't remember what we discussed, but in any case, it wasn't that.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli warplanes target Syria, states a leader
Israeli warplanes have reached a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia Thursday night, confirming a military officer in Fox News.
The manager did not specify the target, but said there was at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was Russian manufacturing missiles SA-125.
At least twice this year, Israel has carried out air strikes against missile shipments in Syria.
Foreign workers in possession of a visa 457 may have to pass a "authenticity" test
The Government is currently exploring the possibility of establishing a "authenticity" test for foreign workers in possession of a visa 457 while considering extending the law enforcement measures.
The test, if adopted, would be applied in accordance with a test to prevent 457 visas from being used to occupy unskilled positions or as a diverted means of bringing his family and friends to Australia.
A government working paper was unveiled today when Labour MP Maxine McKew denounced the government's speech on foreign workers, saying that he could offend Australia's neighbours.
"The disappointing statements on "foreigners returning at the end of the line" and "jobs for Australians first" are an unpleasant return at the time when trade unions demanded a protected labour market," she said at Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that the Whites' work had to be protected – and I would not be surprised that some countries in the region saw it as an echo to this historical artifact.
The working paper reported on the 12 measures previously envisaged by former Minister of Immigration Chris Bowen.
The Minister of Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka to meet with senior officials to discuss trafficking in human beings, has implemented five of the recommended changes, while the others are under review.
If the "authenticity" criterion was adopted, a visa applicant could be checked to find out "if the job offer is authentic in the event that the applicant is a personal relationship or partner of the owner or the person concerned within the firm who sponsors it".
Companies could also be required to report the number of visa holders 457 after some of them, having intended to sponsor a small number of workers, actually employed hundreds of them.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker would have died of a heart attack after arriving on a boat carrying asylum seekers to Christmas Island this week.
The choking son of the 9-year-old man went to Australia with him and found some comfort since his father's death on Wednesday with an adult cousin who was also on board.
The man was transferred urgently by the Australian authorities to the hospital on Christmas Island, where he died.
A study aimed at increasing the benefits of the HS2 Railway Project for Scotland was launched by the British Government.
The work carried out by HS2 Ltd suggests that high-speed services to Scotland and northern England will start from the opening of Phase 1 in 2026.
The Barone Minister of Transport Kramer said that the project "would bring the United Kingdom together".
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said "excited" about working with the British government on the project.
Phase 1 will lead to a new high-speed railway line between London and the West Midlands.
When Phase 2 is completed, the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building the high-speed link between London and northern England from £32.7 million to £42.6 million.
The British Government, which is in conjunction with Transport Scotland, has asked HS2 Ltd to study the strengthening of rail capacity and the improvement of journeys for the north of England and Scotland.
This should include the possibility of travel between Glasgow and Edinburgh by up to three hours.
Barone Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that will bring the United Kingdom and its cities closer together."
We push the HS2 project because the benefits it presents are enormous.
Without it, we are facing a problem of the capacity of our railway network.
But it is also about developing connectivity between the 18 major British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, so that the links between them are better thanks to HS2.
British Secretary of State for Scotland, Alistair Carmichael, added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr. Carmichael to support the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: "The high-speed train has the potential to offer considerable economic benefits to Scotland, but it also brings the economic weight of Scotland into the overall high-speed rail network project throughout Britain.
"We are therefore excited to work in partnership with the British Government to examine options to bring the high-speed train network to Scotland, creating an advantage for all and complementing the Glasgow-Edimburg line that the Scottish government is already planning.
"I look forward to reading the review report with the British Ministers next year and we will then decide on the next steps together."
The rules on the use of electronic devices are currently in force in Australia.
Australian air passengers will have to continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing in spite of the U.S. gesture to ease the regulation on electronic devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration left the door open to U.S. carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read electronic books, watch videos or play games on their devices during critical flight phases provided they are in "aircraft" mode.
Passengers can already do this during most of the flight, but many people find it difficult to access their electronic books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers are examining the decision that requires American carriers to perform important work in order to meet the requirements, but indicated that they do not intend to change their procedures immediately.
Civil Aviation Safety Authority also stated that it examined the announcement but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical flight phases were still in force in Australia.
"The CASA does not have specific regulations governing the use of electronic aircraft," she said.
The issue is regulated and requires aircraft operators to ensure the maintenance of safety at all times and passengers to comply with the safety instructions provided by crew members.
Virgin, who has already told CASA about her intention to extend the use of her entertainment system on board using Wi-Fi technology, was open to change, but said she would follow the regulator.
"We would welcome a review of the CASA that would allow the use of electronic devices because we really believe that this would improve the customer experience now that we have (of the entertainment system on board using Wi-Fi technology) on our aircraft," said a spokesperson.
Qantas said she is currently in compliance with the current rules.
"According to our current policy, electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and we do not intend to change this immediately," she said.
The FAA decision applies to U.S. airlines.
However, we are still interested in the regulatory developments that could benefit passengers, and we will examine closely the FAA decision and the reasons for it.
For U.S. carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from electronic devices, as well as review manuals, training equipment, hand luggage transportation programs and passenger instructions.
"As soon as an airline has verified the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use light portable electronic devices, such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at all altitudes," said the FAA.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will ask passengers to turn off their aircraft during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier devices be safely placed under the seats or upper compartments during take-off and landing.
Pia: at least four wounded in a violent fight
The small town of Pia experienced an unusual excess of fever Thursday night.
Three gendarmerie vehicles, two ambulances and a catch of about thirty people according to the testimonies collected...
On this Halloween day, the evening was agitated on the side of Pia where a rix involving several people burst on the side of the Post.
At least four minor injuries would be to be deplored.
Allegedly, the gendarmes went on site to separate the belligerents and to ensure that the wounded were taken care of.
Singapore's bonded lenders take advantage of the middle classes forced to tighten their belts
In a paid lender at the Bendemeer mall in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga puts down a bracelet, ring and a pair of gold earrings to pay for her daughters' tuition fees.
"My husband and I just bought a house so all my money went in," said Amirthalinga.
Although she earns $3,000 from Singapore $2,400 a month as an administrator and her husband also works, her monthly family income is not enough, she says.
In fact, the claim is similar in some parts of South-East Asia – where household debt increases – that ValueMax, where it made its transaction, became this week the third bonded loan company to be introduced to the Singapore stock exchange.
Betting jewelry is not just a quick way to get cash – $1,300 from Singapore in Mrs Amirthalinga's case – but it's almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
In general, Singapore bonded lenders raise an annual effective interest rate of 17 per cent, just above the 15.4 per cent offered by the United Overseas Bank, a local donor with a branch in the same commercial centre.
However, lenders on bond have the advantage of not asking for solvency or proof of salary, and can unlock loans faster than banks.
As a result, millions of people across the region turn to lenders on bail while families feel the pressure exerted by increasing the cost of living and over-indebted households and consumers.
After five years of strong growth since the global financial crisis, and cheap credit fuelled by too laxist monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families turn to lenders on bail to bridge the gap while their economies are slowing down.
This week, the Standard & Poor's rating agency cited the growing indebtedness of households, mainly due to higher mortgage loans, as a risk factor for the solvency of Asian banks.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore were recording the debt ratio of households/grossest gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia comes at the top of the list with 80% of GDP, while this rate was 60% in 2008.
Economists also fear the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which recently emerged from a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, data showed an ongoing weakness in exports and a slowdown in consumer demand.
"The balance is that with rising costs, people at the middle or bottom [wage scale] are seeking to supplement their incomes as they can," says Song Seng Won, economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historically high gold prices over the past two years have made people willing to take their personal effects in order to reach the value in cash of their jewelry.
In Singapore, about 70% of the items on sale in the 200 loan stores in the city-state are in gold.
People say, "The price of gold is high, let's pay the chain in grandmother's gold and we'll come back looking for it next month."
In Thailand, the largest loan shop operator, EasyMoney, has recorded a 20% increase in the number of customers using its stores in recent months.
The increase is such in the bonded loan sector that ValueMax, operator of the shop in Bendemeer and 15 other shops like it in Singapore, plans to develop not only in neighbouring Malaysia – where it already has four shops – but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, his general director.
The company will finance them using 60% of Singapore's $66 million that it raised this week at its introduction to the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some low-rate lenders have wiped out criticisms of the exorbitant interest rates they practice, Ms. Yeah indicates that bonding not only offers lower rates than other lenders, but also does not directly increase the debt.
"Customers mortgage property they already own, and money laundering does not increase household debt," she says.
It is becoming more and more socially accepted as a means of obtaining guaranteed short-term funding.
The people who go to the lenders on the bond are not only those who have financial problems.
The wealthy people of Singapore also go to the ValueMax Gage loan shops to buy ingots of gold or Rolex watches, which can represent up to 60% of their cash purchase price.
We see customers from every layer of society.
"It may be an elderly person who needs to borrow in the short term for commercial activities or investments, or small businesses that have cash needs to go through a difficult way," says Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Pastor accused of child pornography in Nova Scotia
A pastor who took care of young people in the Halifax region of Nova Scotia is accused of juvenile pornography.
Aaron Hudgins, aged 30, was arrested Friday morning following searches at his home and at the National Research Council office where he works.
The Baptist church of Timberlay, where the pastor was working, is deeply saddened by this news.
In a press release, church officials indicate that Mr. Hudgins resigned from his post.
The pastor was released on condition.
In particular, it must not communicate with persons under the age of 18 and do not access the Internet.
He will compare in provincial court in Halifax in December.
He goes in Nazi uniform to the supermarket before he gets rid of it
A man dressed in a Nazi uniform barred from a brassard with the gamed cross was asked to leave an English supermarket, customers complaining to the management of the facility that called the police, said the store Friday.
"We received several customer complaints, so we asked him to leave the store," explained a spokesperson for Asda's supermarket chain.
The store called the police to rescue her, but "the time she arrived, she had already gone unscathed," she added.
I was tailing when I saw a woman who seemed upset.
People were dumb-mouthed.
"You don't go out on the street like this unless you want to draw attention," testified a customer, Rosina Rusin, 60, to Cambridge News.
This incident occurred on Thursday, the day of the Halloween party, where it is customary to dress up as a monster, but it was difficult to know if it was a canal.
A man from Cambridge claimed responsibility for this act on his Twitter account, where he posted images of Adolf Hitler.
"I've been wearing a black brassard SS twice a week at Asda for three years," said Paul Dutton, explaining his "mental problems".
325 M$ rescue plan for Tasmania's health system
The federal government maintains that the $325 million rescue plan for the sickening health system has strict conditions to ensure that the government of the state will not waste funds.
The Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek announced that Commonwealth is currently taking "emergency" measures to end a crisis caused by the ageing of the island population, the high rate of chronic diseases and the constraints of the system.
The funding, scheduled for 4 years, was decided upon consultations of the government with the Independent Member of Tasmania, Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has proposed an emergency rescue plan that, in our view, will address the unique difficulties facing the state," said Plibersek today.
The $325 million plan includes a $31 million campaign for non-emergency surgical operations.
2 600 additional operations, including in the field of orthopaedic surgery and cataract, will help to catch up.
Funds are also provided for clinics without appointments in Hobart and Launceston, better external care, training of medical staff, mental health services and the deployment of electronic medical records systems in local hospitals.
"These investments respond to the idea that, according to front-line clinicians, this is the best way to treat Tasmania's health system," said Dr. Plibersek.
The Minister stated that the Tasmanian government would face a strict reporting and accountability regime.
The State will need to maintain current levels of funding to receive Commonwealth money and prepare monthly reports on sectors where it spends additional funds.
A three-person commission will be established to ensure that the State provides services in the most effective and efficient manner possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that the $325 million will not count for much "unless they are followed by a real reform to consolidate the Tasmanian public health system".
However, he congratulated the Government for responding to the request for urgent assistance it submitted to the Prime Minister in early May.
"I hope the federal aid plan will greatly contribute to removing Tasmania's public health system from the black list," Wilkie said.
According to the Government of the State, these additional non-emergency procedures will largely reverse the recent cuts.
But the spokesperson for the opposition to health Peter Dutton believes that today's announcement is a "fortunate solution".
"The reason we're here is that the State Labour Government has withdrawn $430 million from its health system," he said on ABC TV.
We can't have a state government that takes almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth that makes $300 million, and pretend it's a rough day.
Mr. Dutton visited Ms. Plibersek to ensure that no dollar of the rescue plan would be spent in additional bureaucracy.
The adaptation by Guillaume Nicloux of Denis Diderot's novel is a remarkable artistic direction and a thorough reconstitution of the time, but it is also more laborious than it should be.
Taking place in France of the 1760s, she tells the dark story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent to a convent by his family.
When she rebel, she faces cruelty without the edge of a deliberately sadistic Superior Mother and becomes an object of erotic fascination for another.
The film never spills into Lubricity or sensationalism, and that's the problem.
The conscious solemnity of the narrative could also become a penitence for the public.
Syria has destroyed its ability to produce chemical weapons, says the monitoring agency
Syria destroyed equipment essential to the production of chemical weapons and ammunition filled with toxic gases, declared the international chemical weapons monitoring organization Thursday, while violent clashes raged in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic agents are supposed to be stored.
A group of Syrian militants also reported on Thursday that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the beginning of the civil war in the country nearly three years ago.
The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW)'s announcement came with a day ahead of the deadline for
1 November established by the organization based in The Hague ordering Damascus to destroy or "make useless" all chemical weapons production units and machines intended to mix toxic gases and fill ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important stage of the ambitious schedule to destroy the chemical weapons of Damascus by mid-2014.
As a result of the destruction of equipment, Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still needs to start the destruction of existing weapons and reserves.
It is believed that the country has about 1,000 tons of chemical products and weapons, including mustard gas and the neurotoxic agent sarin.
The announcement was made as the fighting raged on Thursday in the city of Safira, which according to experts houses a chemical weapons production unit as well as storage sites, reported the Syrian Human Rights Observatory based in Britain.
The group of militants, which follows the evolution of the human balance through a network of Syrian-based activists, said Thursday 120,296 people were dead.
Among them, 61,067 civilians are estimated, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, it is estimated that 29,954 members of President Bachar el-Assad's armed forces were killed, 18,678 of whom were pro-government fighters and 187 of the Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
Among the dead, it is also estimated that 2,202 were deserters and about 5,375 of the opposition fighters, many of whom were strangers.
On 25 July, the United Nations estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
She hasn't updated that number since.
Some 2 million people had to flee the country because of the conflict.
El-Assad's troops have fought against the rebels, many of whom have been linked to Al-Qaeda network groups in Safira for weeks.
The Observatory declared on Thursday that there were losses on both sides, but provided no clarification.
The fights highlighted the importance of the dangers faced by chemical weapons inspectors when they have to complete their mission, which is to rid Syria of its toxic arsenal in the midst of a prolonged civil war.
A statement by the OPCW, working closely with the United Nations, indicated that its team was "now satisfied to have controlled – and seen destroyed – all declared critical production and machines intended for mixing and filling."
She added that "no other inspection activity was planned for the time being."
Earlier this week, the inspectors stated that they had completed the first stage of the verification work by visiting 21 of the 23 sites reported by Damascus.
They were unable to visit the last two sites due to concerns about their safety, the inspectors indicated.
Thursday, the OPCW said that both sites were, according to Syria, "abandoned and... that the elements of the chemical weapons program they contained had been moved to other reported sites, which were inspected."
It was difficult to know at first sight whether Safira's unit was one of the two sites that CIPO inspectors were unable to visit.
Syria submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons, which was approved the following month by the Executive Committee of the IAEA.
"I welcome the moral strength and courage that you have all demonstrated as part of the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization," said the Director General of the organization Ahmet Uzumcu, in a comment published by the OIAC.
Now in its third year, civil war mainly opposes the Sunni Muslim rebels to the government of El-Assad and its security forces, which are supported by members of the Alaouite sect, a branch of Shiite Islam.
On the other hand, the director of the Syrian Human Rights Observatory stated that there was a strong explosion on Wednesday in an air defence base in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion remains unknown, did he add.
Anger provoked by the sentence imposed against one of Bali's bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the Bali bombings in 2002 reacted with anger to the sentence pronounced against the last conspirators to be brought to justice, saying that Umar Patek should be shot by an execution squad.
Patek, who spent almost 10 years on the run as one of the most sought after men in South-East Asia, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in the manufacture of explosive devices used during the attacks.
It could be released after 15 years of parole.
The 45-year-old man was convicted of mass killings for the attacks aimed at two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injured many.
He was also convicted of many other charges in connection with terrorism, including a wave of attacks on churches throughout Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecutors applied for life imprisonment, but they could have asked that the man, known as the Demolition Man, be sentenced to death for his reputation as an expert in the manufacture of bombs.
The decision brought back painful memories for June Corteen, a mother of Perth who lost her two 39-year-old twins, Jane and Jenny, in the destructions perpetrated by Patek and the other conspirators almost ten years ago.
On the verge of tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should have followed the same path as the other men.
"He should be dragged before the execution squad," said Ms. Corteen to the AAP.
I have to live every day without having other grandchildren, or seeing my daughters.
The Sari Club was completely destroyed when a huge bomb, loaded in a van parked outside, exploded just after 23 a.m. on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar when a kamikaze had a back bag loaded with explosives barely 20 seconds earlier.
He fell into a coma after the attack and remained unconscious for a month, and he died three times while under respiratory assistance.
Mr. Hugues said Patek should have known the same fate as the other three members of the Jemaah Islamiyah terrorist cell responsible for carnage – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were executed four years ago.
In fact, this man should have been sentenced to death before the others.
Keeping him alive, why, there's no reason to keep him alive.
After 20 years in prison after killing 202 people and hurting hundreds of others, it's not much.
Patek is the last of Bali's bombers to be brought to justice.
He had managed to avoid being captured for almost 10 years but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabate, where the U.S. forces will kill the former leader of Al-Qaeda, Ousama bin Laden, less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI officer stated that intelligence reports had revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden in order to reestablish links between terrorist groups in Southeast Asia and Al-Qaeda.
"He didn't go," added Ms. Corteen.
Until recently, he was mocking the sadness he had caused to others.
The verdict was rendered on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the attacks that will be celebrated later this year and marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
"There will be a lot of tears this year," said Ms. Corteen.
Patek, however, may appeal to his conviction.
FAA: Air passengers can now use gadgets on board aircraft (but not a call with their mobile phone)
Airline passengers will be able to use their electronic door-to-door devices to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music – but not speak on their mobile phone – under the new very expected guidelines published Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect immediate changes.
The speed with which the change will be put in place will vary from airline to airline, said FAA administrator Michael Huerta at a press conference.
Air carriers will have to prove to FAA that their aircraft comply with the new guidelines and have updated crew training manuals and aircraft storage rules for compliance.
The FAA stated that it had already received plans from certain airlines to expand the use of electronic devices on their aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are among the companies that have already submitted plans.
"According to the plan, we could approve an expanded use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers must turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft doors are closed.
They are not supposed to light them up before the plane reaches an altitude of 10,000 feet and the commander gives its green light.
Passengers are supposed to turn off their aircraft when the plane is down before the landing and do not light them up until the aircraft is set.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference will be able to allow passengers to use their aircraft during take-off, landing and ground rolling, FAA said.
Most of the new line planes and other aircraft that have been modified to allow passengers to use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, said happy about these changes.
"Once the new policy is implemented safely – and we are going to work closely with the carriers to do this – it will be beneficial for everyone," Glading explained in a statement.
We are honestly tired of feeling like "room overseer" when it comes to this issue.
But it will always be forbidden to connect to the Internet to surf, exchange emails and SMS or download data below 10,000 feet, said the agency.
Passengers will have to put their smartphones, tablets and other devices in plane mode.
So still no Words With Friends, the Scrabble-style online game to which actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he was kicked out loud from an American Airlines plane after refusing to turn off his device while the device was parked at the door.
And heavier devices like laptops will always have to be stored because they could hurt someone if they flew through the cabin.
On-board mobile phones will also continue to be banned.
The regulatory authority for mobile phones belongs to the Federal Communications Commission and not to the FAA.
FAA may lift the ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national transport safety expert on CBS News, said that mobile phones were always considered to be at risk.
"Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they could possibly create interference with navigation instruments, but because we know, according to the FCC, that they could disrupt mobile phone networks if they were used on board," Rosenker said.
An Industrial Advisory Committee established by the FAA to address the problem recommended last month that the government authorize wider use of personal electronic devices.
The pressure on the FAA has increased in recent years to ease restrictions on its use.
Detractors such as Senator Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., claim that there is no valid security reason for these prohibitions.
Restrictions are also increasingly difficult to apply as the use of devices has become omnipresent.
Some studies indicate that at least one third of the passengers forget to turn off their devices, or deliberately do so.
The FAA began to limit the use of electronic devices in 1996 as a result of the reports on interference with navigation and communication instruments when passengers carried FM radios, the high-tech gadget then.
New line aircraft depend much more on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed to withstand electronic interference and approved by the FAA.
The airlines have allowed their passengers to use Wi-Fi at cruise altitudes for several years.
The modified aircraft to host Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of line aircraft should allow wider use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices generally emit much lower power radio transmissions than previous generations of devices.
E-book readers, for example, only issue minimal transmissions when you turn a page.
But transmissions are stronger when devices download or send data.
Amazon.com is one of those who press for a smoothing of restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers.
In 2011, company leaders commissioned a Kindle e-book reader line aircraft and flew it to see if there were any problems, but there was none.
This inspired members of the FAA Advisory Committee mixed feelings about whether or not the use of devices presents a risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airlines Passengers stated that he thought interference from devices was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other committee members stated that there are only anecdotal reports from pilots that indicate that devices can interfere with an aircraft's systems, and that most of them are very old.
However, the committee recommended that FAA allow pilots to request passengers to turn off their aircraft during landings to instruments under low visibility conditions.
A group of the travel industry welcomed the changes, calling them meaningful arrangements for travellers with technology.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not incompatible with security," said Roger Dow, President and Director of the U.S. Travel Association.
A helitreuized bird from a North Sea platform has been released into nature
A bird, helitreuized after being found exhausted on a North Sea oil platform, was released into nature.
The water stream was mounted aboard a helicopter heading to Aberdeen last month before it was set back by the Scottish SCCA in its Alloa rescue center.
The Central Director, Colin Seddon, said: "This stream of water was probably a wintering migrant from Northern Europe who was caught in the midst of violent North Sea winds."
It seems that the exhausted bird would have managed to find refuge on the oil platform.
He added: "He was unable to fly again, so we were contacted to provide our help."
The water stream was healthy when it was released.
Is the European elite ready to do business with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise of bringing together businesses and defining what the creators of wealth and jobs want to see change in our relationship with the EU.
To do so, we have commissioned the widest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders and asked them what they thought of Britain, businesses and the EU.
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 business leaders, which are broadly representative of all sizes of companies, sectors and regions of Great Britain.
The findings of the investigation will be a surprise to many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now seeking to export outside of Europe, focusing on the countries that are modernizing and developing while the EU states are stagnating.
They want to see the government give priority to new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil rather than get involved in the long and arduous process of reforming the European institutional arcanes.
When asked for their opinion on specific policy issues – ranging from the regulation of monopolies to product laws – the majority of business leaders believe that the control of these key skills should return to Westminster.
The single market has led to a general dissatisfaction, with companies saying that the cost of the Brussels regulation is disproportionate to the benefits to be enjoyed in the European trading area – 40% of the large, traditionally the most pro-European companies, even agree.
Finally, and more importantly, our survey of business leaders revealed that a large majority wanted Britain to continue its initiatives to change the Treaty and develop a trade-based relationship with the EU rather than politics.
This conclusion, which is found in all major groups and businesses of all sizes, shows that the company's world insists on a "significant change" that brings power back to the United Kingdom.
The issues are high – reaching out to change the Treaty and better representing Britain's interests would allow 16% of the votes to be cast in favour of maintaining the country in the EU during a referendum.
The Prime Minister should not doubt a single moment: this survey shows that British companies support this plan to renegotiate the terms of Britain's accession to the EU.
It also shows that companies hope that renegotiation will be a significant change in the current balance of power in favour of a return to the hands of the United Kingdom.
It is possible, and increasingly necessary, to better represent the interests of British companies, since the euro area is committed to a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be employment and growth in Britain and, as the findings of our survey show, for businesses this means refocusing on trade and a fundamental change in Brussels' regulatory approach.
The United States with Halloween colors
In the United States, President Obama did not derogate from Halloween's tradition.
With his wife last night, he distributed friands to hundreds of children invited to the White House gardens in Washington.
Last year, Halloween festivities on the east coast of the United States had been cancelled due to the passage of Hurricane Sandy.
This year, therefore, the feasts have caught up.
In New York, thousands of costumed people participated in the parade organized in the "Greenwich village" district.
Everyone is over-excited, tells one of the participants, Andrea.
I was finally able to put on the costume I had planned last year.
We have fun like crazy, add Rhonda.
People are happy.

Alexei Miller de Gazprom states that Bulgaria's pipeline opens a new era of gas
The start of the construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe's largest energy projects, said the Director of Gazprom.
"A historic event has taken place today: Construction has begun in the Bulgarian part of the South Stream pipeline, the largest large-scale project in Europe," explained Alexei Miller, Gazprom's Managing Director, in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of energy security across the European continent.
South Stream should allow us to diversify Russia's export routes to Europe.
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its Ukraine counterpart, which transits most of the Russian gas to Europe, increases the level of risk compared to conventional channels, adds the Director.
Miller added that the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated "forever".
Bulgarian consumers will receive South Stream gas at a reduced rate as soon as the whole project is launched in 2015.
Gazprom indicated that construction should start in other countries downstream by the end of the year.
The pipeline was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubic metres of natural gas.
Pitcairn wants to create the world's largest marine reserve
The island of Pitcairn wants to create the world's largest marine reserve, announced Thursday the daily Les Nouvelles de Tahiti, taking in information from Radio Australia.
This island, east of the Gambian Archipelago (French Poland), is the last British territory of the South Pacific, halfway between New Zealand and Chile.
This territory measures 47 km2, if there are three other small islands nearby.
He has been British since his occupation in 1790 by the Bounty mutinies, an episode of the history of the British Navy that gave rise to three Hollywood adaptations.
Some tens of people, mostly descendants of Bounty mutinies, still live in Pitcairn, and their incomes depend on 95% of London's generosity.
The Island Council unanimously voted in favour of the creation of a marine reserve around the small archipelago, or 836,000 km2 that corresponds to its exclusive economic area.
An Assistant to the Mayor of the island went to London to ask Britain to validate this request.
Mike Warren, Pitcairn's mayor, believes that the creation of such a protected area would be a first step towards more financial autonomy for his island.
The project must be accepted by the British Governor of Pitcairn, residing in New Zealand, and by the British Government.
The establishment of such a marine reserve would allow the United Kingdom to sanctuarize these 836,000 km2, however, provided it has the means to monitor it, which is not the case.
There is no airport in Pitcairn, which makes it impossible to base one or more aircraft dedicated to monitoring the area, and there is no port where to place military surveillance ships.
As for France, it must already carry out the very expensive air and sea surveillance of the five million km2 of the French Polynesian EEZ, neighboring Pitcairn.

Life imprisonment for a former Chinese deputy governor
A former deputy governor of the province of Jilin, north-eastern China, was sentenced to life imprisonment on Friday for corruption.
Excluding from the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was accused of having hit more than 19 million pot-de-vin yuan, reporting the Chinese official media.
Between 1995 and 2001, the Deputy Governor, who was also the President of the Bank of Jilin, a public institution, helped companies and officials to obtain contracts, loans or promotions in exchange for money or gifts, declared Beijing's first intermediate court on its microblog.
President Xi Jinping, who took office last March, made the fight against corruption a national priority, believing that the phenomenon posed a threat to the existence of the Communist Party itself.
If the head of state promised that justice would be as intrusible with the powerful "tigres" as with the "mocks" - the subordinate officials - only a handful of high-ranking officials were convicted, including former Petrochina oil giant executives.
The most spectacular recent case was that of the former head of the CCP in Chongqing, Bo Xilai, sentenced to life in September for corruption and abuse of power after having targeted the highest functions within the state.
But the government has never expressed any intention to reform the anti-corruption system by creating, for example, an independent party body.
Two YMCA employees charged with sexual assault following allegations made against Jonathan Lord at a hearing of the Royal Commission.
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales were accused of sexual assault against children following allegations made against the educator of Caringbah, Jonathan Lord, in 2011, at a hearing of the Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse of Children.
But in its opening statement to the Commission, the YMCA stated that it "had never had to deal with a problem of sexual assault on children within its organization."
Director General Phillip Hare was questioned about two cases: one YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences and a physical education monitor at YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of sexual assault on children at the centre where he worked in 1991.
Mr. Hare told Gail Furness, counsel counsel to the Commission, that he had heard of the first case but was not aware of the second case.
He also admitted that the opening statement of YMCA was incorrect, pointing out, "external controls of YMCA were carried out and indicated that child safety was an absolute priority for the organization."
It was demonstrated before the Commission that the YMCA had been informed that it had received the second worst appreciation of four institutions during a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities in August of this year.
Mr. Hare, who started working at the YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that staff management was a failure with Lord's recruitment and failed to verify that employees knew they had to report any violations of the child's security policy.
Earlier in the year, Lord was convicted of sexual assault on twelve boys during the two years he worked at the YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum sentence of 6 years in prison.
But Mr. Hare rejected the idea that the YMCA would have a cultural problem preventing staff from reporting Lord's shortcomings to the safety of children.
Staff members testified that they had observed certain shortcomings, including the fact that Lord remained alone with the children, who were keeping them in private, had them sitting on his knees, told them that he loved them and let them play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was headed by Lord and who had asked for child protection training because she was worried about her behaviour, said she was the head of the YMCA Caringbah, Jacquui Barnat, who was "very intimidating and difficult to approach most of the time."
The Director General said that he rejected the testimony of the staff that they were reluctant to report these deficiencies to their superior.
Instead, he stated that the friendly relations they had with Lord clouded their judgment, which is why they did not report their actions.
Mr. Hare said that he had expressed his view before the YMCA Council of New South Wales that, for the organization, the lesson drawn from "the Jonathan Lord incident" should not concern "the reporting" by staff, and the council agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to sign confidentiality agreements to staff was taken by YMCA Director General for Child Services, Liam Whitley, shortly after the allegations were raised.
He stated that this decision was intended to avoid any contamination of evidence but that it was "excess of zeal" and that it had been misimplemented.
The YMCA of New South Wales was not a safe organization for children at the time Jonathan Lord was employed, namely, between 2009 and 2011, said the expert on sexual violence against children, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University before the Commission.
He indicated that there were "serious problems" in recruitment, control, initiation, training and supervision of staff.
The hearing was adjourned until 20 December.
Tony Blair said he would seize the opportunity to become Prime Minister again, but recognized that his return was unlikely.
In an interview last night marking the 5th anniversary of his departure at the end of his term of office, the 59-year-old man expressed his opinion on various national policies.
Since his departure in June 2007 after a decade at the head of the country, Mr. Blair has largely avoided discussing British policy, limiting his comments to foreign affairs and his role as a Special Envoy of the Quartet for the Middle East peace process.
When asked whether he would like to find the position of Prime Minister, Mr. Blair would have responded, according to London's Eventing Standard: "Yes, of course, but it may probably happen, so..."
When many experts in equestrian demonstrations met in Cardiff to fight and win the Year's Horse Trophies, they knew that the competition would be rough.
But nobody expected to win Fenton Kirkland, a three-year-old.
Not yet in school and only a few months after making his first weapons, the toy and his pony Shetland Toffee trotted on the three laps with great ease and won the first prize, leaving behind the other 30 adult competitors.
The two inseparable – which are of the same size – were greeted for the presentation, attitude and style during the annual competition that took place at the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre, in Rudry near Cardiff.
Faced against men and women in elegant melon hats, he wore his flat cap a little casually on the side to show off his 2-year-old Toffee pony around the track.
Fenton was greeted by judges for his rare natural qualities of training for a child of his age.
And Toffee received very good notes for her presentation and her personality.
Fenton has had Toffee as a gift for his 3rd anniversary last March and has been training since with his Shetland pony every day.
His 30-year-old mother Donna said, "Fenton and Toffee do an excellent duo."
They presented themselves to and against all, but both cooled the cup of gold and rosette.
It was only the second time he was competing with Toffee and we were crazy about the joy he won.
On the track, people who didn't know him thought he was so phenomenal they wanted to get photographed with him.
This young boy, from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, in the south of Wales, follows the tracks of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been participating in equestrian contests for more than 10 years.
Mrs. Howells said, "There was electricity in the air, and everyone encouraged it and applauded it."
He walked the entire length of the running track and even if it seemed to be quite small, he did a wonderful job.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and the rural world and has two chickens he takes care of.
The way he started, he will certainly soon participate in the year's Horse Show – and I'm sure he will make a good performance.
A spokesperson for the annual equestrian event said: "Fenton is only 3 years old, but he knows how to drive his pony."
They're a good team.
The judges noticed that Fenton and Toffee were very good and the way they paraded on the track.
They are looking for an effective teamwork between the pony and the trainer – Fenton and Toffee were the best on the track.
I'm sure his beautiful clothes helped Fenton, he was really proud to go.
A Chinese newspaper that launched a call "will be remanded"
A Chinese newspaper that launched a front page call for the release of a defamation journalist will be remanded, states a press regulator.
The New Express based in Guangzhou has issued a rare public appeal for the release of Chen Yongzhou journalist.
But Mr. Chen subsequently admitted to television that he had accepted bribes to make stories about a semi-public society.
Now, the New Express will undergo a "complete remodeling," said the regulator.
The order of "renewal" comes from Guangdon's administration for Press and Edition, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express, belonging to the Yangcheng Evening News group, had published several incorrect articles on the listed Zoomlion company between September 2012 and August 2013.
"New Express writing was disorganized," the regulator said in a statement.
He said he had decided "to impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou by withdrawing his press card."
He also "ordered the Yangcheng Evening News group to undertake a complete remodeling of New Express, and recommended that it conduct an investigation into those responsible at New Express and immediately re-engineer the newspaper leadership team."
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express on the alleged financial irregularities of a construction plant manufacturer named Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his newspaper twice issued a first-page call for his release, writing that he supported his journalism.
But then Mr. Chen appeared on a public television station where he admitted to publishing false stories against money.
"In this case, I have harmed Zoomlion as well as the media industry and its ability to gain public confidence," he said to the CCTV public television network.
I did it mainly because I ran after money and celebrity.
I realized my mistake.
Following Mr. Chen's apology, New Express published his excuses on the front page, writing that he had failed to properly verify his articles.
Several important suspects recently made television confessions.
Experts say that people are systematically forced to confess, despite a change in the law that was voted earlier in the year prohibiting the authorities from forcing anyone to commit themselves.
The Charles-de-Gaulle aircraft carrier in "unavailable"
In Toulon, the aircraft carrier is on its way.
The leak of radioactive vapour detected on one of Charles de Gaulle's two nuclear boilers, in mid-October and while the boat was at sea, was "no danger to the sailors", but it is not without consequence for the Navy.
The Royale has just confirmed to us "the unavailability" of the ship until "the mid-November", "the time to take the corrective measures necessary" on the reactor.
For its part, DCNS, a defence naval specialist, ensures that its teams and those of Areva, deployed in Var for the occasion, "currently intervene on the aircraft carrier".
It is for them, among other things, to change a pump on the failing heating.
"Everything is implemented so that Charles De Gaulle can deploy its planned deployment at the end of 2013," says DCNS.
And the National Navy certifies that "it does not question the ship's programme of activity" on nuclear propulsion.
Let us remember that the aircraft carrier Charles-de-Gaulle comes out of a six-month intermediate maintenance period.
He had operated from Toulon in mid-October for training.
This, in particular, is intended to qualify young fighter pilots.
A "little damage", circumscribed to the reactor's containment area, had then occurred on the admiral ship of the French fleet.
According to the National Navy, the crew had not been exposed to any radioactive contamination.
For more than a year, everywhere, I have been able to see a strong dissatisfaction on the part of the people I meet: monstrous re-evaluation of their properties, flood of taxes, cost of permits of all kinds, administrative costs not to end.
In short, unlimited siphoning of our pockets.
Millions of dollars of dilapids could be spared in order to allow a very respectful taxation of those who pay.
Any money removed from force to taxpayers diminishes their freedom of consumption and contributes to their impoverishment.
In Shawinigan, despite the closure of all major companies, there is no concern about the sumptuous expenses and maintenance of wood ducks: deficit cultural centre, strong grant to the City of Energy, etc.
If these facilities are not profitable, they are sold to or demolished to the private company.
It is also navigating to discover the expropriation of several properties in order to host a major industry that has never come.
However, I give an honourable mention to the transformation of the former Wabasso into a kind of industrial incubator, but at what cost for the payers of taxes?
It is not the public level to invest in such companies, but the private sector based on consumer demand.
The citizens were pleased to learn that the lakes to the Fisheries and the Piles will continue to supply the city with drinking water.
Following the departure of all industries (large water consumers) and the large decline in the population, water use has declined considerably throughout the territory.
Without saying waste, the city will never lack water and strict regulations on its use could be greatly softened.
In short, it is very easy to achieve great things with the money of others.
I would have been ashamed to defend such a balance sheet.
With a gross debt of over $200 million, this city is not even able to buy a pen without going through a loan settlement.
We have been managed for over 40 years by ties with beautiful diplomas for most of them and I don't think a sheep raiser makes it worse.
Discovery of a U.S.-Mexico drug tunnel with its own railways
One of the most sophisticated drug-trafficking tunnels in the United States and Mexico, with its own lighting, ventilation and electrical rail systems, has been discovered.
The U.S. authorities described the tunnel of 4 feet by 3 as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they had ever seen.
The tunnel, zigzad over an equivalent length of nearly six long football grounds, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, San Diego, U.S.A.
The area is filled with indefinable warehouses, allowing for easy concealment of trucks loaded with drugs.
The tunnel was closed before the drugs came out and went unnoticed, the authorities said.
The authorities seized 8.5 tons of marijuana and 148 kg of cocaine after the tunnel was discovered, according to judicial records.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers, were accused of possession of marijuana and cocaine with intent to sell.
They carry a 10-year prison sentence to life imprisonment if they are convicted.
In Nogales, Arizona, traffickers operate vast underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered following marijuana harvest in central Mexico in October, thus putting a challenge for drug cartels that must quickly deliver their products to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a passage of about 700 yards equipped with railways that went from the kitchen of a house in Tijuana and went up to two warehouses in San Diego.
British police issues extradition warrants against Assange
The British police today issued an extradition warrant against the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange, who took refuge at the Embassy of Ecuador in London and asked for political asylum.
Scotland Yard stated that she had issued a "remission notice" against the 40-year-old Australian, asking him to come to a police station, adding that if he did not, he would be likely to be arrested.
Assange could be extradited to Sweden as a result of allegations of sexual crime, after having exhausted all possible avenues under British law after the Supreme Court had invalidated the appeal against his extradition at the beginning of the month.
Fearing that Stockholm authorized its transfer to the United States, he found refuge at the Embassy of Ecuador in London on 19 June, requesting political asylum from this country in South America.
Scotland Yard "issued a notice of surrender to a 40-year-old man who asked him to come to a police station on the date and time of his choice," said a spokesman.
He continues to breach the conditions of his release under bail.
The Embassy refused to comment on the issuance of the notice by the police.
Assange feared to be extradited from Sweden to the United States where he could be accused of espionage, having unveiled more than 250,000 American diplomatic cables on WikiLeaks website fighting secret information.
How biometry invaded our lives
Finish typing passwords to access his smartphone or pay his purchases?
American, French or Japanese researchers predict a future where we will be recognized by biometric sensors of phones and computers.
Bernard Didier , Deputy Director General of Morpho , even estimates that "the century will be biometric".
Only biometrics will ensure the identity of a person performing transactions in a universe as transverse and transnational as the Internet .
Privacy organizations confirm this enchantment for biometry, but worry about it.
Only in 2011 and in France, the National Commission for Computer Science and Freedoms authorized 774 systems for the recognition of fingerprints, the form of the hand or the venous network of the hand in companies, administrations, canteens...
"Everybody can soon be identified, anywhere and any time," said Justin Brookman, responsible for consumer privacy at the CDT (Center for Democracy and Technology), in Washington.
The reasons for such optimism, in some, and pessimism, in others?
Biometry will be based on new techniques, which will provide new services to citizens and consumers.
Today, in France, the most used biometric data are the fingerprints, the contour of the hand and the venous network of the palm or fingers.
But each of these techniques has its own constraints.
"For example, some concrete workers have very damaged fingers and their fingerprints are unreadable," notes Philippe Robin, technical director of the identity field at Thales Communications & Security.
And the collection and verification of the venous network and the contour of the hand imply a voluntary and precise gesture of the people.
It is both a safety - we cannot capture this data in vain - and a disadvantage: the procedure must sometimes be repeated and therefore take time.
As a result, research has been carried out over the past 20 years on other approaches, such as facial recognition or iris (the colored part of the eye).
Thanks to the increased accuracy of sensors and the ability to calculate the computers needed for data analysis, these techniques become operational.
The precision of facial recognition has been multiplied by ten over the last five years, calculated Cyrille Bataller, director of Accenture's R&D laboratories in Europe.
With our help, the United Kingdom and Holland deployed automatic border crossings using facial recognition.
It is now possible to identify a moving face or iris.
"Today, we are conducting research on the recognition of voice or how to walk using sound sensors, but we need a quiet environment," says Sridhar Iyengar, Director of Security Research at Intel Labs.
Unique and infallible brand, DNA is also a source of hope and concern.
"In the current state of knowledge, it can be considered as the ultimate biometric data," confirms Sophie Voretiet-Tavenier, director of studies, innovation and prospective at CNIL.
But DNA analysis is still very long and very expensive.
NEC offers judicial police services a suitcase costing $90,000 to analyze DNA samples at a crime scene and within an hour.
The uses of biometrics are divided into two groups: identification (recognizing one person among others) and authentication (to ensure that the person is the one it claims to be).
The identification was currently concerned with the issue of identity papers: the biometric elements (prints, photos, iris) must be compared with the information that the state has on all already fixed citizens.
This ensures that one person does not try to usurp someone else's identity.
This principle of comparison may have other applications.
NEC thus offers VIP recognition at the entrance of a hotel or store.
"We collect images from surveillance cameras and compare them to photos of celebrities that circulate freely on the Internet," explains Dany Nassif, responsible for commercial development for biometric identification solutions at NEC France.
Other use: take a quidam who queues in a store, follow its progress through facial recognition and calculate the waiting time.
Authentication initially involved physical access (border, protected premises, cellars...) or logic (opening a computer).
More recently, it has been added to the presence check.
"One pointed biometric avoids the phenomenon of the boyfriend that points for another," explains Cyrille Bataller, of Accenture.
But, increasingly, authentication will also concern transactions, in particular those made from devices connected to the Internet.
In Japan, it is already possible to withdraw money from some distributors by introducing its card and placing its hand on a biometric reader: this gesture replaces the impact of the secret code.
A similar technique is tested in Villeneuve-d'Ascq and Angoulême by the Natural Security company in partnership with banks and large distribution teachers: at the time of paying in store with its bank card, the client does not type his code, but introduces his finger into a reader who scans the veins.
Experimentation is planned to last six months.
If it is conclusive, biometric readers could soon arrive at French traders.
Hints to reassure users
There are three ways to make biometry attractive to the public.
The first is to explain that she can make time.
"If, thanks to biometry, a customer stays in a box for thirty seconds less, it's appreciable," says the director of a large surface.
The second is to offer personalized services: in a few years, a voice server will be able to recognize your voice and offer you custom options.
And finally, reassure by highlighting the precautions taken to protect databases.
"Digital fingerprints are stored on a first server; people's identities are in a second base: the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure box, which blocks if we try to move it," says Philippe Robin of Thales.
However, because of the lack of in-depth studies, it is impossible to know whether these speeches really convince users.
The privacy specialists continue to be concerned.
"The progress of facial recognition, the multiplication of surveillance cameras and the huge amount of photos available on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa make me fear the worst: widespread surveillance," predicted Andrew Patrick of the Office of the Privacy Commissioner in Canada.
A driver driving at 210 km/h with a hot drink between his legs was caught with an almond of £1,000
A car driver was fined £1,000 for driving at 210 km/h with a hot drink balanced between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree in the Essex, was found driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 up to Braintree on May 27.
When the police arrested him, they discovered the drink to take between his legs.
At the Colchester Court of First Instance, Howie admitted the offence of driving without the necessary prudence and attention.
The seven points withdrawn from his permit resulted in a six-month withdrawal of a permit.
Howie was also convicted of paying £90 and a surcharge for a victim of £100.
A tax on foreign real estate owners to blow up the London bubble
The Treasury has provisionally quantified the capital gains tax measure but awaits a final decision by Mr. Osborne, who, in the 2012 budget, has entered a 7% stamp fee for properties costing more than £2 million and annual expenses for buyers who choose to own property under a corporation rather than on an individual basis.
The stamp law already applies to residential properties of the Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea arrondissements, and represents £708 million over the fiscal year 2012/13, which exceeds the total amount of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, North East, North West and Yorkshire and Humber.
Mr. Cook stated: "As a result of the increase in stamp rights on high-value properties and the introduction of anti-avoidance legislation in this area, it is very difficult to predict that high-value properties are sub-imposed independently of the effects of the obsolete housing tax system."
"But this change could make foreign investors reluctant to the idea of buying properties in London or current owners resistant to the idea of selling," he added.
The prestigious real estate – the 5 to 10% of the highest prices in the real estate market – in the prosperous sector located south-west of London from Fulham to Wimbledon, has increased by a record 11.8% in the past year.
Prices in central London show a steady year growth rate of 5.6% but have been eclipsed by a growing "internal market", the south-west of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) with a recovery, according to Savills' studies.
Scientists have just highlighted the way a dog's tail movements are linked to its mood.
Previous studies revealed that happy dogs moved their tails further to the right (from the point of view of the dog), while nerve dogs moved it further to the left.
But now scientists say dogs can detect and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trent, said: "Everyone knows that in man, the left side and the right side of the brain are involved differently in the stimuli that arouse positive or negative emotions."
Here, we tried to see what was in other species.
He added that as in man, the right side of the brain was responsible for the movement to the left and vice versa, and that both hemispheres played a different role in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to the disordered tail movements of other dogs, researchers followed animals watching movies where other dogs appeared.
They measured the heart rate of the animals and analyzed their behavior.
It will certainly not take long before we understand why their tails sometimes go on one side and sometimes on the other.
Professor Vallortigara explained: "We presented to dogs films where other dogs were present – either a naturalist version or a silhouette to prevent any other confusion – and we were able to traffic the movement of the tail and present it as going more to the left or to the right."
When the animals saw a dog without expression turn the tail to the right (from the point of view of the dog that removes the tail), they remained perfectly relaxed.
But when they noticed a tail drifted mainly to the left (once again from the point of view of the dog that removes the tail), their heart rate accelerated and they looked anxious.
Professor Vallortigara said he did not think that dogs would communicate deliberately with each other through these movements.
Rather, he thinks that dogs know by experience the movements they should or should not worry about.
He added: "If you meet other dogs several times and you notice that, most of the time, the movement of their tail to one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and that the right side leads to a less friendly attitude, you will react to this experience."
Researchers indicate that results could enable owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand the emotions of their animals.
The canine behaviour expert John Bradshaw, a guest professor at the School of Veterinary Sciences at the University of Bristol, said that this was not the first study to examine the importance of the left and right in the canine species.
Last year, a team at Lincoln University discovered that dogs turned their heads to the left when they looked at an aggressive dog and to the right when it was a joyful dog.
And in another scientific study carried out by the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: "The dogs went more easily to a robot dog when his tail moved to the left rather than to the right, instead of becoming anxious – the opposite of what was in the Italian study."
He indicated that differences could come from the fact that dogs who participated in the various studies did not fully consider animals from movies or robots dogs as dogs.
A study on how dogs react to real dogs could be useful, he explained.
"Although many elements, found in different mammals, indicate that the two sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be specified – and dogs are no exception," he said.
However, given the ease with which their behavior can be recorded, it will certainly not take long before we understand why their tails sometimes move on one side and sometimes on the other.
Arctic Monkeys reports a concert to Glasgow due to the disease of Alex Turner
The Arctic Monkeys rock group postponed a concert in Glasgow after a laryngitis was diagnosed with his singer.
The Sheffield group was due to take place on Friday in the concert room The Hydro in downtown.
However, his laryngite forced singer Alex Turner to reprogram the show.
The announcement was made after the group was forced to postpone a concert at the LG Arena in Birmingham Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys stated: "Following the decision to postpone the concert to the Birmingham LG Arena tonight and after requesting medical advice, Arctic Monkeys must also postpone the show to the Glasgow Hydro on Friday, November 1.
"Alex Turner suffers from a laryngitis and regrets that she can't come together."
The performance at the Birmingham LG Arena will take place on 20 November and the performance at the Glasgow Hydro will be held on 21 November.
All tickets remain valid for these concerts.
We would like to apologize to all the ticket holders for any inconvenience.

Pope Francis will appoint his first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on 22 February, announced the Vatican Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest churchmen in the Catholic Church behind the pope, and those who choose him, so Francis will appoint his first group of men who will ultimately choose his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, as soon as a cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of a pope – this is why it is a group of 120 "elector cardinals".
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said that a meeting bringing together all existing cardinals would be held before the ceremony at which bishops would be raised to the dignity of cardinal, known as consistory.
"Pope François decided to communicate his decision to convene the February Consistory in advance to facilitate the planning of other meetings requiring the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that by February, the number of Cardinals electors will probably have decreased.
He stated that a pope generally named as many cardinals as necessary for the number of electorate cardinals to reach 120 and as many cardinals over 80 years of age as he wanted.
The consistory of next year will be important because it will be the first since the election of Pope Francis in March of this year, said Valero.
At the moment, there is a sort of tendency to give priority to Europe and in particular to Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he added.
40% of Roman Catholics live in South America, but a small number of cardinals represent them.
Cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since Francis formed the council of cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world who are responsible for examining ways to reform the church.
Earlier, the pope had decided on his own.
"Now François has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," Valero explained.
He added that it was "all possible" that François asked Cardinals for advice.
But we have never experienced such a situation – it is completely new.
Valero said that the popes generally raised bishops representing vast communities in the rank of cardinal, but that Francis was "full of surprises – so we do not know who he will appoint."
GM recalls some of its new pickups in the United States to repair the seat back
General Motors Co recalls almost 19,000 of its new pickups Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra 2014 to solve a problem with manually tiltable files, according to a Friday declaration by the U.S. agency responsible for vehicle safety regulation.
On some pickups, the front seats could present a defect at the inclination mechanism level.
Consequently, the files do not comply with federal vehicle safety standards for head restraints.
"If the vehicle is hit by the rear, the head restraint may not properly protect the passengers, thereby increasing the risk of injury," according to the statement posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).
The recalled models were built between 1 August and 10 September.
The deployment of GM pickups began in June and represents the most important launch of vehicles for the first American car manufacturer since its bankruptcy and restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the owners of pickups of the defect during the first quarter of October.
The NHTSA was unable to review the letter of information to the owners due to the 16-day cessation of government activities, which slowed the growth of vehicle sales in October.
The sales of peaks Silverado and Sierra, which were redesigned for the 2014 model, increased by about 20% during the first 10 months of the year, GM said Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 pickups Silverado and 16,503 pickups Sierra.
GM's share course increased by 1.4 per cent to $37.47 at the New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon.
A worker dies under concrete blocks
A construction worker died under dozens of concrete blocks in Montreal on Thursday afternoon.
The drama occurred around 11 a.m. on Marquette Street, close to the intersection of Beaubien Street, in the surroundings of Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie.
In all likelihood, work on the foundations has been taking place in this area for some time.
A mitoyen foundation wall had just been erected in the last few days.
The accident occurred at the time the victim had just arrived on the site to retrieve his tools.
I was driving by and I saw the wall collapse with a big cloud of smoke, said Sylvain Jean, who lives near the construction site.
I landed and went to remove the big bricks that covered him.
We only saw a part of his back, it's so unhappy.
According to the authorities, the victim is an elderly man in 50 who worked for a co- assembling company.
Resuscitation maneuvers were attempted by emergency services, but were unsuccessful.
The man did not survive his severe injuries.
An inspector of the Labour Health and Safety Commission was sent to the premises to investigate the circumstances surrounding this drama.
The cry of despair from an election voter from Obama
I voted twice for President Obama, believing in the possibility of a change
He says Obama has made laudable efforts in the obstructionism of the Republican Party
Obstructionism does not excuse the difficulties of the Obamacare site, nor the drone attacks
The memory of the 2008 Obama campaign is a sad reminder of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year medical student at Harvard Medical School.
I'm reading a tragicly sad book these days.
It is a book that, I thought, would encourage me during the morosity of the 2nd year of medicine and give me hope.
It's called "The Audacity to Win" and it's the memoirs of the 2008 Barack Obama presidential campaign.
When I finished the medical records of my patients in the evening and I fell asleep, this book brings me back to the time when policies inspired millions of people and where speeches could cut you off.
The election ended with a dramatic victory, and the presenters of the Newspapers took the time to reflect on the historical nature of the moment.
My friends cried with joy and my parents kept every newspaper they found.
A young team of visionaries advanced towards the White House and the nation was ready for change.
During the transition period in Obama prior to his office in 2008, he had 82 per cent of favourable opinions.
And then I close the book.
Returning to the present is a difficult awakening, it's like coming out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these days full of optimism, they are like distant memories, a sad reminder of the opportunities of the past.
The change really happened in the years that followed the first time I voted.
It had nothing to do with what I imagined.
I credit Obama for great achievements, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act (Affordable Care Act) to the departure of Iraq from our army, through the end of the "not seen nor known" and the assassination of Oussama bin Laden.
In addition, I believe that partisan obstructionism has destroyed too many efforts to advance our nation in the area of immigration reforms, public health care and the closure of Guantanamo, among other things.
But after having repeatedly defended the administration of Obama against my peers and colleagues, I can no longer provide explanations.
I am on the brink of political despair.
The Republican obstruction cannot explain the listening of foreign leaders, nor the attacks of innocent foreign children by drones.
It cannot explain that the National Security Agency collects data on the privacy of Americans, nor is it responsible for the denunciations that reveal the harm of the government.
It cannot justify the murder of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without trial, nor the evasion of public funding and the overexpenditure authorized during presidential campaigns.
It cannot justify the conclusions of a report which states that the efforts of the White House to reduce the media to silence are the "most aggressive... since the administration of Nixon".
And, more recently, it cannot excuse the impossibility of designing a simple website for more than three years after the Affordable Care Act Act has been ratified.
I don't know if that's what I expected.
If, at 18 years of age, I was supposed to understand that governance could contradict the above political campaigns.
Of course, the electoral function is not predictable, because the opposition political party and the random events, such as Newton's massacre, influence our public conversation.
However, all the examples I have listed above appear to be largely the choice of administration.
That's what bothers me the most.
I voted again for Obama in 2012, but not because I was excited by his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confused and unrefined alternative that did not seem to allow to determine its policies or positions.
I felt that Obama, elected for a second term by being freed from the pressure of future elections, would keep the promises that we have been talking about for so long.
However, while the favourable opinion index has plunged below 45% this week, it is even more difficult to return to 2008 through this book.
He makes me want the many promises that have flown.
This week, I read the part of the book that describes how Obama suffered enormous losses for Clinton at the Pennsylvania Mayors.
At a post-campaign meeting, he told his team that they needed to get back on track and remain faithful to their cause.
"I want us to look back on our talent," he said.
We must remember who we are.
Here we are five years later, Mr President, and I no longer agree with you.
The views expressed in this commentary are only those of Nathaniel Morris.
Friday, about 3 p.m., a violent collision between a motorcycle and a car occurred from Retinne Street to Fléron.
Jonathan, 26 years old, of Fléron, did not wear helmets.
Despite the rapid intervention of relief, he died during this frontal collision.
Clive Palmer claims that MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system.
Billion MP Clive Palmer suggests that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system because his daughters could be pregnant and enjoy this system.
The mining magnate, which contests the payment of a carbon tax of $6 million, argued this argument to try to avoid questions about a potential conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial when deciding whether carbon and mining taxes should be abolished.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and indicated that Mr. Abbott's daughters were ready to benefit personally from these policies.
"There will be a major conflict of interest when it comes to paying parental leave because if one of his daughters is pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether or not he gets a leave," said Palmer.
Two months after his election, the Electoral Commission officially declared that Mr. Palmer had won the seat of Sunshine Coast of Fairfax by 53 votes after recounting.
Mr. Palmer moved on to the idea of a remodeling of the suffrage removal system to accelerate the process.
The girls of Tony Abbott, Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the vote is complete?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why can't we have a system in which you can enter, enter your coordinates into a computer, immediately vote and have the result at 6:30 p.m. the next morning?
Mr Palmer also criticized the use of paper crayons to mark ballots.
Is it in order to erase the result if someone disagrees?
Today, having a pencil of paper seems amazing.
The Electoral Commission has studied options for electronic voting and has recently published a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer, 59, said that his political project included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take up his new functions "very seriously".
The exercise of public functions is a matter of public service.
"We are not looking for rewards, except for the reward of history because we must serve the community at a critical time," he added.
A team of biologists led by the Wildlife Conservation Society in New York identified a new species of stocking dolphin off the northern coast of Australia.
Thibaut Bouveroux, head of scientific mission to the Observatory for the Conservation and Study of Animals and Marines (OECAMM) returns to L'Express on this discovery and explains the long process of identifying new species.
Does the discovery of this new species of humpback dolphin surprise you?
It's good news, but I'm not particularly surprised.
If, in the past, species have been described and identified on a morphological, anatomical and geographic basis, today, the development of new tools such as genetics allows us to improve our knowledge of species classification sciences.
Furthermore, it is not impossible for these advances in genetics and molecular biology to question the classification or belonging of a species to a kind, a family, or even an order.
At the beginning of the 19th century, morphologists classified animals, based on morphological differences between species.
Today, some of these classifications are challenged as a result of advances in genetics.
Similarly, two very morphologically close species have been distinguished through genetics.
This is the case with the new species that has just been identified.
About ten years ago, the scientific community recognized two species belonging to this subfamily: Pacific stock dolphins and Atlantic stock whales.
Recent analyses have distinguished four species.
Why is this an important discovery as stated by the Wildlife Conservation Society?
From a conservation point of view, it is essential to know these genetic differences, in order to protect the species and thus its genetic variability.
If this population had been known for a long time by researchers, they did not know that it was part of a new species, only present at this place.
Hence, if a problem of massive mortality caused by a viral epidemic or accidental capture occurs in the region, we could have a problem with extinction of a species rather than a local disappearance of a population of a more widespread species on Earth.
This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic.
A species is considered threatened or endangered depending on the number of individuals existing on Earth, i.e. stock, and the possibility of re-establishment from nearby stocks.
As for the species Sousa chinensis, whose population of the new species has been discovered, its stock has automatically become weaker, making it more vulnerable.
Why is it rare to discover new species of marine mammals?
Marine mammals are located at the top of the food chain.
They live in homogenous, open habitats, in which there are many genetic exchanges between populations and individuals.
This gene brewing limits the creation of new species.
Conversely, closed ecosystems promote genetic isolation, which can eventually create new species.
It is necessary to know that the marine environment is the least well-known environment.
We prefer to send robots to Mars, rather than to know what lives in the Marian pit, just 11 kilometres from the surface of the sea.
We spend more money on life search on other planets than in marine research and it's a long time that it changes.
RBS suspends two traders on the foreign exchange market
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange market division from two sources close to the file, which shows once again that the global regulators' investigation into the suspicions of currency market manipulations is beginning to bear fruit.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBs, have confirmed that they cooperate with regulators in the most important financial market surveys in the world, where 5.3 billion US dollars change hands every day.
Both traders are the first employees of RBS to be suspended in the context of the expansion of the investigation that echoes the scandal of interbank rate manipulations Libor.
The bank, which refused to comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it received requests for information from regulators.
"The ongoing investigation into this case continues and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and the other regulators," said a bank representative two weeks ago.
Last month, sources close to the file stated that RBS had transmitted e-mails and instant messages, sent to and by a former trader, to the British regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, left the RBS in 2010 and was reportedly suspended from his position as the European accountant for currencies at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of the European cash exchange manager at Citi, was released this week, while Matt Gardiner, senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders were charged.
Mr. Usher's file included instant messages sent to and by bankers working at Barclays and Citigroup, added sources close to the file.
The UBS explained this week that it had attempted action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator, Finma, stated that it was investigating suspicions of foreign exchange market manipulations in a number of Swiss banks.
In the world, at least six authorities – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Competition Authority Weko, the FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – examine allegations made about bankers that would have agreed to manipulate exchange rate rates.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Crédit Suisse also launched internal investigations or received requests from regulators for information, indicated sources close to the file.
Banks use instant messages and emails sent for years to find cases of wrongdoing.
News about these surveys has shaken traders in an area that has been one of the largest growth engines of investment bank trading units in recent years, but has been challenged this year because of the low currency volatility that limits opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to minimize the case by saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast market for highly liquid exchange, but senior traders explain that this is not necessarily true.
A senior trader said that despite the high volume of daily exchange transactions, the fragmentation of liquidity between trading management platforms and the increasingly frequent use by banks of their own internal platforms "explains that it is possible to start having an impact on the low-cost market."
The news came on the very day when Crédit Suisse announced that he had returned a trader working in his office from the London Stock Exchange this week after it had caused a loss of $6 million at the end of last year.
The bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with the regulators.
"We are convinced that the trader has acted alone and that the case has been handled," said a representative of Credit Switzerland.
The investigation of Mayor Rob Ford was framed, supports a lawyer
After the police confirmed that they had put their hands on a copy of the video showing Rob Ford smoking crack, Me Clayton Ruby said he never saw a "stitching so" investigation.
I said Ruby believed in La Presse Canadienne that the police had "ignored or minimized" the evidence against the mayor.
On Thursday, the police arrested Rob Ford's casual driver Alexander Lisi, 35, and accused him of extortion in connection with the video.
Alexander Lisi, formerly accused of drug trafficking, was in frequent contact with the mayor.
The police also said they observed this man delivering packages to Rob Ford, indicating new court documents.
Me Ruby described as "inexplicable" the fact that the police never searched Rob Ford's vehicle or his home, or put up to listen to his phone, claiming that police chief Bill Blair chose knowingly not to act against the mayor.
Under the law, the police, having witnessed suspicious transactions in their own hands, would have been able to intercept Rob Ford's vehicle, arrest the mayor, and carry out a search - even without a warrant.
It could have also requested an instant search warrant, if deemed necessary.
The chief of police did not comment, but his spokesman Mark Pugash described Me Ruby as "obvious and desperate attempt" to argue with the media in a case that does not concern him at all.
At the press conference on Thursday, Mr Blair stated that there was nothing in this video that could constitute "reasonable reasons" which could lead to the filing of a criminal charge against the mayor.
European Fellowships down at mid-seat, except London
With the exception of London, the main European Stock Exchanges are going down on Friday to mid-seat, dubbed by some disappointing news, while Wall-Street is expected to rise.
In addition, investors remain cautious because they believe that the US Federal Reserve could reverse its quantitative adjustment policy earlier than expected.
On the other hand, after the announcement of 0.7% inflation for the euro area as a whole, the idea spreads among market players that the European Central Bank (ECB) could ease its monetary policy.
The futures of Wall Street precipitate an opening of the American shares up, after two consecutive sessions of replicating.
At the values, Renault (-4.63%) records the strongest replica of CAC 40, plummeted by the warning on the result of its partner Nissan Motor Friday.
Royal Bank of Scotland (-6.26%) marks the worst performance of EuroFirst300, after having also published declining results this morning and announced the internal creation of a bad bank comprising 38 billion books of the most risky assets.
For its part, Vodafone (+2.45%) has maintained the head of the EuroFirst300 increases in response to press information that AT&T is studying a possible OPA.
On the foreign exchange market, speculations on the evolution of the ECB's monetary policy go hand in hand, as John Hardy, strategist at Saxo Bank.
The ECB's unique mandate has always focused on inflation, so Mario Draghi and his team have more reasons to act at the next week's meeting.
We anticipate a strong potential for the downturn of the euro.
In this context, the euro continues its reply against the US currency and reached $1,3517 in the first two weeks.
These same conjectures support the reverse of the euro area bond market.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Obama Health System Reform Act
Great victory for the Obama administration: the U.S. Supreme Court today stated that Obama's health system reform law was constitutional.
By 5 votes to 4, the judges validated the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Act on the Protection of Sick and Affordable Care) – which requires citizens to submit health insurance by 2014, without having to pay a fine – and declared that it was constitutional under the government's tax power.
The President of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, joined the four most liberal members of the Court, while Justices Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy expressed their disagreement.
The Court also validated the other sections of the 2,700-page Act and also considered that the provision of the Health Reform Act, which stipulates that the eligibility threshold for Medicaid should be lowered to the extent of losing all federal funding for the program, was coercive in accordance with the Constitution.
The procedure for blocking the law was initiated by 26 States and the National Federation of Independent Business.
All major Republican candidates in the 2012 presidential election, including the designated Mitt Romney candidate, were fiercely opposed to the law.
Vibrating tribute to the Veterans in Menton
At the heart of the Trabuquet cemetery, civil, religious and military authorities, as well as many patriotic associations, paid tribute to the soldiers and deceased of all wars this afternoon.
Gerbes were deposited in two of the three military squares of the cemetery by MP Jean-Claude Guibal and various personalities.
Placing of Palestinians and Israelis at the Gaza border
Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers wounded on Thursday, 31 October 2013, at the evening of a violent siege to the Gaza-Israel border, the most serious incident in Palestinian territory for a year.
The only power plant in the Gaza Strip ceased to operate on Friday, November 1, after a depletion of its fuel stocks, announced the Palestinian enclave's Energy Authority.
A local commander of the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, Khaled Abu Bakr, and another member of the Hamas army, Rabieh Barikeh, were killed by a tank shell shot during an Israeli army raid in eastern Khan Younès, south of the Gaza Strip, according to local medical sources.
Two other local leaders of the Al-Qassam Brigades, Mohammed al-Qassassa and Mohammed Daoud, were killed when an Israeli helicopter opened fire in the same region.
Their bodies were discovered later.
According to Palestinian security sources, the four combatants conducted a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian enclave and Israel.
An attack on a Palestinian tunnel
According to the same sources and witnesses, an Israeli tank and a armoured bulldozer raided a hundred metres into the territory before leaving.
The fight lasted half an hour, according to witnesses.
In a communiqué, a Hamas spokesman, Sami Abu Zuhri, paid tribute to the four "heroes" and affirmed that Israeli soldiers had been killed during the confrontation.
Hamas congratulates Al-Qassam's heroes who fell by defending the territory during an incursion of the Zionist occupying in Khan Younès.
Several enemies were killed and injured during the operation.
"Hamas ensures Gaza will be a hell for the occupant," the spokesman threatened.
For its part, the Israeli army indicated that the target of its operation was initially a section of a large tunnel dug up in Israeli territory since the Palestinian enclave, discovered on 7 October and intended, according to the army, for "terrorist activities".
Hamas claimed the use of tunnels to fight Israel, stating that the aim was to remove Israeli soldiers to exchange them against Palestinian prisoners.
The operation aimed at preventing future terrorist attacks using this tunnel, explained an Israeli military communiqué.
During the operation, Hamas launched an explosive weapon targeting the forces of Tsahal (the Israeli army) and wounded five soldiers.
Israeli attack in northern Syria
"This mission was imperative because of the risk of using the terrorist tunnel for attacks on Israeli civilians," said Army spokesman Peter Lerner.
In addition, Israel struck an air military base in northwestern Syria, aimed at carrying missiles for the Lebanese Shiite movement Hezbollah, reported on Thursday, 31 October, the Al-Arabiya satellite network.
One U.S. official confirmed an "Israeli strike" but did not provide details on the target.
"In the past, targets have been missiles transferred to Hezbollah," he merely added.
Israeli officials refused to confirm any information concerning such an attack.
Quoting "exclusive resources" that it did not appoint, the Saudi capital chain said that "the bombing targeted a shipment of solar-air missiles destined for Hezbollah in Lebanon", referring to the powerful Lebanese Shia movement that fights rebels alongside Syrian forces.
Earlier, a Syrian NGO, the Syrian Human Rights Observatory, had reported several explosions heard on the Syrian coast on Wednesday at dawn in an air defence base in Sonar Jablé, near Lattaquié.
This organization based on a network of activists and medical sources had not been able to identify the origin of the explosions.
Back in black and white for Marie Chouinard, who presents her two new group choreographies in Dance: the first inspired by the inks and poems of Henri Michaux, the second inflated by the famous piano solo Gymnopedias of Satie.
An evening that allows you to see all the prism of Chouinard, from art to ticks and black ink to white.
A white screen served as a background wall.
On the carpet, also white, in the immense space that is the Maisonneuve Theatre, advance, profile, end as a line and dressed black, a body.
On the screen, an ink of Henry Michaux is designed.
The body, simple bond, takes its shape.
And this will be the shape of the whole piece: a string of physical imitations of drawings.
The dancers, fully dressed in black, only the hands and face discovered, wait on each side of the playing area, rush when the next graph appears, incarnate it, emerge in the stream.
This black and white game by Henri Michaux is performed in solo relays, in group to union (a mass that makes solo), in large group of twelve solos where each performs its sign.
We think of "Glory of the morning", where, in solo, Chouinard performed a series of choreographic tasks written on posters, placed online at the front stage.
That's the same principle, giant PowerPoint version.
Here, music is strong, percussions and electric guitars.
The energy is high, the pace is always fast.
There will be a breakdown when Carol Prieur will take refuge under the dance rug, to deliver, micro in hand, with no sobriety or withheld, part of Michaux's poem, monocord and monotone in the cry, and continue dancing.
And the music to go out, and the sequence to resume.
This loud and energetic discharge, long, if possible, ends up absorbing and numbing.
As is done by the regularity of the visual rhythm.
There are a few beautiful flashes - the creation of images has always been a force at Chouinard - like these hairs that dive or these black fabrics that lengthen the lines.
But the choreographic approach is lacking in composition.
We have the impression that the choreographer, instead of going to meet Michaux's work, has imposed itself, with his ticks.
As a result, the bodies appear flat in front of the drawings.
Michaux inks, like Gestalt shapes, open a wider and giboyous imaginary than dance, more porous.
Only the end, in negative, with its dancers swept by a stroboscopic light and the white signs in a sudden black theatre, touches on magic.
The audience loved it, the welcome was warm.
The Gymnopedias, after the incarctation, are richer.
The scene is partly grey flagged, the dancers and a piano are covered with fabrics, like furniture in a abandoned house.
On the piano, dancers compete to play the scores.
Their misunderstandings in music, touching, give true fragility.
On stage, they pass the couple, in love duos, very sensual, even erotic.
Group work, small transition soils, moving sets, choirs, writing is less binary.
Sneaks appear, as familiar as Chouinard, treed the red nose, in very polarized male-female love parades.
Love is carnassier, fugitives or players.
Gesture, laughter and small screams beautifully transpose the archaic, grace and ridicule of the cot bodies, of the beings that melt.
But the play takes its real flight after salvation.
A clown comes back on stage when the audience leaves.
There everything becomes allowed: the fourth wall falls, the explored universes overlap, the dancers go cabotine, descend among the spectators, gloss, smoke, short-circuit, play codes of applause, stretch the sauce into a knowingly calculated disorder that remains sensual.
Joy and madness sweat, and it is the art of Chouinard, there to contaminate the public.
Google, Samsung and Huawei are prosecuted for Northern patents
The group that owns thousands of former Nordl patents has started an avalanche of patent prosecutions on Thursday against manufacturers of mobile phones, including Google, the company that it locked up on the stake during the sale of patent auctions that took place after Nordl's bankruptcy.
Rockstar, the consortium that acquired Nordl patents for $4.5 million, filed a complaint against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other patent infringement companies before the United States Court of Assets in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly held by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
Patents contain technologies that allow advertising to be displayed in relation to Internet search terms, indicated the trial conclusions, which is Google's core business.
It was not possible to join the representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC manufacture phones that operate under Google's Android operating system, which gives fierce competition to Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial $900 million offer for Northern patents.
Google has increased its offer several times, finally proposing $4.4 million.
After losing the Nordl patents in face of Rockstar, Google subsequently acquired Motorola Mobility for an amount of $12.5 million, a partly based market based on the Motorola patent library.
"Although Google has failed in its attempt to acquire the patents in question during the auctions, it has violated and continues to violate the patents," said the trial conclusions.
Rockstar claims more damage and interest against Google because he claims that Google's patent violation is obstinate, according to the complainant.
Explosion of a house in Gesves: a defective water heater at the origin of the explosion
The grandmother would have lit a cigarette during a gas leak.
The explosion of a dwelling in Gesves, which made two serious injuries Friday morning, a 52-year-old grandmother and her 5-year-old grandson, is due to a gas leak from a defective water heater, reported Friday evening the substitute for the King's prosecutor.
The expert posted on site by the parquet ensures that the origin of the explosion is purely accidental.
The grandmother lit a cigarette while there was a leak and gas accumulation.
The life-threatening of the two victims is always engaged.
The grandmother was designed by the explosion and is severely burned.
The boy, who was staying at his grandfather's house and his companion, was beside him and was burned more lightly.
"The two victims were intubated and heavily conditioned on the spot before they were taken to the CHU of Liège, she was in a helicopter, he was in an ambulance," said former minister José Paulet, who came down to the scene.
Traumatized, the grandfather was upstairs at the time of the explosion.
Safe and except, he was able to reach the ground floor by the stairway left intact while the rear wall of the house was completely destroyed.
The grandfather and tenant of the neighbouring house, weakened by the explosion, were relocated by the president of CPAS.
The firemen of Andenne and Namur and the Arches police intervened.
The civil protection of Crisnee stabilized the two buildings.
Egypt asks the first freely elected President to swear
Mohamed Morsi made the oath of investment, but it is unlikely that his day of triumph will mark the end of political conflicts in Egypt.
Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised the emergence of a "new Egypt" when he swore an investment oath to the presidency, thus becoming the first freely elected president and succeeding in Hosni Moubarak, who was expelled from power 16 months earlier.
During his investment in the High Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamic President of the Arab world and the fifth head of state of Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy 60 years ago.
He swore oath before the 18 judges in black robe of the Court whose building on the edge of the Nile was built to resemble an Egyptian temple.
"We look forward to a better day, a new Egypt and a second republic," said President Morsi during the solemn ceremony broadcast live on public television.
"Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy and stability," explained Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer trained in the United States from the Muslim Brothers, a fundamentalist group considered for over 84 years since his formation as an illegal and severely repressed organization by successive governments.
Hundreds of soldiers and police were guarding the building when Mr. Morsi arrived shortly after 11 a.m., local time, followed by a small convoy.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered before the Court to cheer the new president and, starting from the presidential phase of the Moubarak years, the circulation was only briefly interrupted to allow the passage of his convoy into the very frequent streets connecting the city centre to the southern suburbs.
Considered to be the little charismatic "help wheel" of the Muslim Brothers, his personal prestige has been greatly enhanced since his victory and his Friday speech during which he tried to present himself as not only the candidate of Islamists but all those who want to finish the work begun at the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian President Mubarak.
"Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," Mohamed Morsi said, in a blue suit and a red tie, addressing the judges present in the hall decorated with woodwork where he swore his oath.
Later, Mr. Morsi went to Cairo University where he delivered his investment speech.
He was officially welcomed by a military fanfare who played the national anthem as he joined the guard.
The Marechal Hussein Tantaoui attended the ceremony.
When he arrived, he was greeted by the song "The people and the army, hand in hand...", which was haunted by thousands gathered in the great amphitheatre of the university.
Founded in 1908 and former bastion of secular education, Cairo University later became a branch of Islamic student groups in the 1970s.
Mr. Morsi made a symbolic oath on Friday at Tahrir Square, from which the uprising that ended the authoritarian regime in Moubarak last year, and swore to recover the presidential powers of which the military council, which replaced the former President-in-Office, deposited it.
But by accepting to make an official oath before the Court, rather than before Parliament as it is used, it bows to the will of the army by showing that the struggle for power is not over.
Mr. Morsi's speech on Tahrir Square was accompanied by spectacular populist gestures.
Shutdown in the USA has slowed the rise in the car market
The closure for 16 days of most federal governments has weighed on the growth of car sales in the United States in October, showing the figures published Friday by the manufacturers, five of the six main companies with lower than expected performances.
The three largest Detroit manufacturers show a two-digit growth compared to October 2012 but only General Motors has done better than expected.
Analysts anticipated on average 15.4 million sales at an annualized rate and corrected for seasonal variations, but the market stood at 15.3 million according to estimates by Morgan Stanley's analyst Adam Jonas.
In a note to the bank's customers, he believes that this slight brake stroke is primarily due to "government's 'shutdown' and its impact on the consumer's feeling during the first fortnight of the month".
GM nevertheless reported an increase of nearly 16% of its sales last month to 226 402 vehicles, compared to 211 563 expected by consensus.
The four brands in the group have seen their trade performance improve compared to October 2012.
Ford, who continues to benefit from the success of his pick-up, saw his sales advance from 14% over a year to 191,985 vehicles, while the consensus was waiting for 194,301.
For his part, Chrysler, controlled by Fiat announced an increase of 11% of its sales to 140,083 vehicles, compared to 143,536 expected.
Toyota and Nissan also show sales below consensus, despite increases over one year of 8.8% and 14.2% respectively.
At the New York Stock Exchange, GM made 1.4% at 16:35 GMT while Ford gave 1.1%.
Renault leaded to Fellowship by Nissan's warning
Renault accuses Friday of the largest drop in the SBF 120 index to Paris after his partner Nissan Motor announced that he had reduced his net profit forecast annually, reporting traders.
Nissan, who had to carry out such a revision, also announced a re-engineering of his leadership.
Several traders reported that Renault was affected this morning by "warning".
"It's clearly Nissan's warning profit," said a Parisian broker trader.
As part of the Renault-Nissan alliance, Renault owns 43.4% of Nissan's capital and the Japanese builder 15% of French, according to data from Nissan's website.
Greece: Two Killed in a Fusillade Near a Place of the Nazi Party · Global Voices
Two people were killed and another was badly wounded Friday night by shots fired by two people who were on board a motorcycle passing in front of a place of the neo-Nazi Aube party golden in the western suburb of Athens, was learned from police source.
The police were not able to provide information on the identity of the victims and their possible political affiliation.
Some Greek media reported that members of Golden Dawn had argued that the victims were guards from their premises.
The injured person was immediately hospitalized, according to the same source.
Police officers from the anti-terrorist service deployed on the central avenue of the Néo Iraklio suburb, where the incident took place and closed the neighborhood.
The incident occurred a few weeks after the indictment of six Golden Aube MPs, including the party's leader and founder, to participate in "a criminal organization" in an offensive against this party launched after the death of an anti-fascist musician by one of its members.
Scott Brown's appeal rejected
Scott Brown, the captain of Celtic Glasgow, has seen his appeal rejected and will be suspended for the next two league matches of his club, against Ajax and AC Milan.
Expulsioned against Barça for having hit Neymar, the Scottish community saw its suspension extended to three meetings by UEFA.
In a press release, his club said "very disappointed", believing that his call was entirely justified.
Almost 50,000 households are electricity-free throughout the province, shortly after noon on Friday, due to violent winds affecting many regions along the St. Lawrence River.
The most affected sectors are Laurentides with 15,042 subscribers immersed in the black, Montérégie with 13,464 and Outaouais with 8642.
The large region of Montreal is also familiar with its batch of panics with nearly 7,000 private power homes in the metropolis and Laval.
You thought travel agencies belonged to the past because of the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to reverse the trend.
The company has revised its net profit forecasts to rise and hopes for record results thanks to the Australian and United Kingdom vacationers.
The travel agency now expects to achieve an underlying profit over the entire fiscal year between $325 and $340 million prior to tax, against a previous forecast of $305 to $315 million.
If current forecasts are achieved, this will represent 12 to 17% growth compared to the record profit of $290.4 million reached in 2011/12.
The Director General, Graham Turner, stated that Flight Centre had achieved 8 per cent of profits in the first half of the year and that the second half had started strong, in particular with regard to travel other than business travel in Australia and the United Kingdom.
"Since the beginning of the year, the 10 countries in which we are present are profitable, and several of them are in a good position to achieve record results over the entire fiscal year before deduction of interest and taxes," he said.
This is true of Australia and the United Kingdom, which are generally the countries that generate the greatest profits.
In Australia, the leisure travel sector rebounded during the second half of the year, compensating a domestic market for slightly lower business travel.
Similarly in the United Kingdom, the Flight Centre leisure travel sector has been successful, while business customers have spent less.
Its subsidiary in the United States recovered its losses during the first half of the year where seasonal demand was lower and had to benefit the entire year for the third consecutive time.
Flight Centre's shares increased by 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Unknowns shoot on a hotel near the pyramids of Cairo
Unsullied people opened fire this Friday on a hotel near the pyramids of Cairo in Egypt without making victims, as a result of an apparent quarrel with retired employees.
The assailants fled, specified the spokesman for the Ministry of the Interior, police general Abdel Latif.
This attack occurs when Egypt receives almost no more tourists since the army dismissed Islamist President Mohamed Morsi in early July and suppresses in the blood the demonstrations of its supporters.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
As part of English literature courses, students will have to study at least one piece of Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, a romantic poem and contemporary British fiction from 1914 to today.
The review will also present "new texts" to encourage more diverse reading.
A combined English- and literature-language course will be deleted.
From 2015 onwards, students will have to pass an independent-language GCSE, and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate English-literated qualification.
The Ministry of Education must publish its new English and math programs tomorrow – the first subjects to be reviewed radically.
It will make changes in other fundamentals next year.
On the other hand, Ofqual, the Regulatory Bureau of Examinations, will unveil a re-engineering of the structure of the GCSEs, with a new rating system and less courses.
Speaking during the summer, Michael Gove, Minister of Education, stated that there was a "large consensus as to the need to reform our review system to restore public confidence", insisting that the GCSEs would be "more stimulating, more ambitious and more rigorous."
Studies show that English schools spend less time at maths (116 hours a year, 3 hours a week during the school year) than most other countries.
In comparison, Australian schools offer an average of 143 hours per year, and Singapore students make about 138 hours of this year.
Although there is no formal obligation to devote more hours of time to math, sources close to the coalition government have indicated that deep maths – as well as the greater importance given to materials in international classifications – would likely encourage schools to provide more hours of education.
The programme will focus more on "real world problems", including financial mathematics.
This judgment means that a law adopted in July in that State, which largely undermines the right to abortion, will enter into force.
An octogenary welcomes children with a rifle at the Too for Halloween
Children 9 and 13 years of age were making door-to-door calls for candy on Halloween night.
One of the suburbs of the Very Visited district by the children opened the door holding his hunting rifle.
The 86-year-old man explained to the gendarmes that he was afraid.
His weapon has been seized.
The former head of the Gestapo buried in a Jewish cemetery
Müller, who disappeared at the end of World War II without his trace, was actually buried in a common grave of a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, says the leader of the German Resistance Memorial, Professor Johannes Tuchel, in Bild.
Müller didn't survive the end of the war.
"His body was buried in 1945 in a common grave of the Jewish cemetery in Berlin-Mitte," he assured the daily drawing by relying on archival documents.
This revelation, 68 years after the end of the Nazi regime of Adolf Hitler, would respond to one of the great enigmas of the After-War.
The German secret services, the BND, were assembling as in the summer of 1949, Müller was in Karlovy Vary, then in Czechoslovakia, according to a document obtained by Bild.
Secret services were totally wrong.
"From August 1945, Müller's body was found in an interim grave near the former Reich Air Force ministry by a commando," said Mr.Tuchel.
He was wearing a general uniform.
"In the inner left pocket, he found his service conditions with a photo," he continued.
Bild also publishes a document from the district of Mitte district in Berlin indicating that he was buried in the Jewish cemetery in the district.
The President of the Central Jewish Council of Germany, Dieter Graumann, was shocked by this revelation.
One of the most brutal Nazi sadistics is buried in a Jewish cemetery, an enormous amount of bad taste.
"The memory of the victims is a huge crowd from the foot," he joined the newspaper.
Heinrich Müller is one of the important figures of the Third Reich that have never been captured.
He took part in the Wannsee conference in January 1942, which decided on the "final solution" and was under his orders Adolf Eichmann, responsible for the "logistics" of the extermination of the Jews, sentenced to death and executed in Israel in 1962.

It walks in mud, jungle and crosses rivers to offer free medical assistance
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free health care in the villages of Cameroon
Dr. Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend seeing hundreds of patients.
There are not many doctors in this West African country, barely 1 for 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or via your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 Heros CNN of 2013.
You can vote for him, or one of the other 10 heroes, to elect him "Heros CNN of the year".
This person will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his sick father alter the periods of consciousness and unconsciousness and went to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he had only a broken arm, but he contracted an infection that spread to his brain, creating a hematoma that he was going to carry with him the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," said Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken her abroad if we had enough money.
Instead, Dr. Bwelle spent years accompanying his father in crowded clinics and hospitals to get any treatment he could get.
"It's not easy," says Mr. Bwelle.
You can leave the house at 5:00, walk to the hospital to be the first, and you're not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
People can die because they wait too long.
The situation has not changed much since Dr. Bwelle's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only 1 doctor per 5,000 inhabitants, according to the World Health Organization.
By comparison, the United States ratio is 1 doctor for 413 inhabitants.
And even if they could see a doctor, many Cameroonians could not afford to pay the consultation.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of the country's health costs are incurred in the private sector.
"The only problem they have is poverty," explained Dr. Bwelle.
And because of poverty, they cannot enjoy life.
After seeing his father and as many of his countrymen suffer, Dr. Bwelle was determined to try to change the course of things.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers performed over 700 surgical acts free of charge last year.
He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon at Yaoundé's central hospital.
And he created a non-profit humanitarian association, ASCOVIME, which goes to rural areas during the weekend to provide free health care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, with about 30 people, they ride into vans after having fixed the medical equipment on the roof and cross difficult terrain to reach villages that need the most help.
Chance doesn't always follow them.
They have often had to push the vehicles to cross rivers or muddy tracks.
But when they arrive, they are received as heroes: the community organizes a party, sings and dances and offers them the best accommodation available.
In these villages, free health care is a good reason to celebrate, and Dr. Bwelle – with his big smile and energy overflowing – is more than happy to join the festivities.
The next morning, the team began receiving hundreds of patients.
"We receive 500 people at each visit," said Bwelle.
They sometimes live 60 km from the village, and they come on foot.
In this travelling hospital, various health care is provided.
Many people receive treatment against malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive berquilles, a pair of glasses collected or a free birth certificate – a document needed to go to school, but many poor families simply cannot afford to buy it.
In the evening, the practical team of simple surgical acts under local anesthesia.
The operations are usually performed in a school, a city hall or a house; after the intervention, the patient wakes up and goes to the waking room to leave his place to the next person.
Thanks to the lighting of the generator, the operating room and the sterilization of the equipment, Dr. Bwelle and his volunteers worked until early Sunday morning.
It's an irresistible pace, but village musicians generally help the team stay motivated.
"They hit drums all night to keep us awake so that we can continue to work," said Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team returns to town, tired but proud of the work it has done.
The group, composed of Cameroonian doctors and medical students, performed 700 surgical acts free of charge in the past year, and knows that their presence can make any difference for those to whom they come to help.
One man explained that the free operation he had undergone to treat a hernia would allow him to work again.
"This will change my future and that of my family," man said.
In addition to having this travelling hospital live and work as a surgeon at the hospital, Dr. Bwelle also works at night in private medical offices around Yaoundé.
It is this second job, he explains, that finances 60% of his association; the rest is covered by private donations.
"I don't know when he sleeps," said Katie O'Malley, a medical student in the second year of Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteer in Dr.Bwelle's group.
He is always at the hospital or trying to find money for his association in order to carry out these campaigns.
For medical students and nursing students such as Katie O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr Bwelle in his missions, this is an opportunity to learn on the ground that they do not have at home.
"We were able to participate in operations to help drain the blood or pass the instruments to Dr. Bwelle," said Miss O'Malley.
This is not something you have the opportunity to do in America when you are a medical student in the second year.
Voluntary students generally pay for their travel to Cameroon, and often arrive with medical equipment collected.
But once in Yaoundé, their pensions, transportation and education are taken over by Dr. Bwelle.
"He's a hero, there's no doubt," said Katie O'Malley.
He gives his life for this association, and his desire to help the Cameroonian people is not close to dying.
For Dr. Bwelle, the relatively constant workload is not a difficulty.
Helping others to live happily by keeping the promise he made to his father is something that brings him immense joy.
"I'm so happy when I do this work," said Bwelle.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
Making people laugh and relief from pain are the reasons that motivate me to do so.

The two Frances of Pierre Nora
Perplexes, the academics have long mastered the definition and location of Pierre Nora.
Professor in the amphitheaters and classrooms?
Probably, but by highlighting its weak for the crossing paths, Sciences-Po, the High Studies.
Arbitrator of other people's works in his office on Gaston-Gallimard Street?
Yes, but by ignoring the hidden work and underground writing of the publisher.
Heir of the chair that occupied Fontenelle at the French Academy?
True again, but knowing that such a sacred thing cannot replace the true holy oil, that of the thesis, of which it has passed.
They willingly recognized in him a great watchman, cheerleader and federator of their work, but noting that he showed little inclination to produce it himself.
To this uncertain image the monument of the "Places of Memory", to which he attached his name, also contributed.
The wicked languages were able to see a gigantic flea market, presented by a smart commentator, equipped with a lively eye-catching and squirming, but unsurprisingly amateur.
The two books published by Nora were soon two years old and already established that the one passing to not write had much and well written.
The book here should give him final justice.
But once again, there is the temptation of ubiquity, intellectual vagrancy, the rejuvenation set to leap like the attached feet of the subject from one subject to another.
But we quickly understand that the disparate objects gathered in this book in such a beautiful title bring the brochant back to one and the same passion: to discover the constitutive node of the French identity.
Why these dramatic calls to national unity?
Identity: It's a time-concern.
Here little, we have been collectively invited to give a definition.
But in the peremptory spirit of our leaders, the French identity was a timeless essence.
It was only necessary to deploy accidents, and the case, required jacobinism, was entrusted to the prefects and sub-prefects, authorized interpreters.
The one Pierre Nora is something else.
He does not become an heir to an eternal franchise, he refuses to the definition.
Concerned analyst of familiar strangeness, he errs in a forest of symbols, stopped at every step by an object in the form of rebus, tormented by irritating questions.
The company, which is born of the company itself: why, in a country that is so durablely situated on its borders, if previously charging and firmly grounded, do we hear these dramatic calls to unity?
They are so pressing, suggests Pierre Nora, only to conjure up the disturbance born of the discords of French history.
Francs and Gaulois, Armagnacs and Bourguignons, Catholics and Protestants: the division forces here are very old.
And the most emblematic is of course the one that breaks into two national history.
From the earthquake of the Revolution, the French have two stories and they have two nations, one monarchy, the other revolutionary.
The second wanted the death of the first, but did not succeed in denying it; rather, it was concerned to find its sacredness and the greater desire of unity and indivisibility that it had cut off its head to the one who was the obvious and powerful incarnation.
And from there, an invincible binary nation, divided between left and right, secularism and Catholicism, adoration and hatred of the revolution.
To make sense of this uniqueness of the French identity, nothing is worth the four steps outside the Hexagon, so that Pierre Nora's American escape might well be the heart of his book.
Because America and France have both made a revolution, drafted a declaration of rights, wanted to establish a new society.
But American cooking only makes it better to highlight what is clean for us.
There, men who had left their Old Regime in England and had no more to worry about.
Here, men surrounded by an ancient native regime, and even more radical.
There's a consensual revolution when here she sowed drama and trust.
There are always honoured founding fathers, and here are revolutionary ancestors whose role is difficult to make, and who have been in between.
There is an institutional constancy, and here is a cascade of constitutions, as well as mistakes to catch up and trials to resume.
France that goes away, France that comes
But there was a time when the French thought they could cover the torn dress of their history, and defeat the curse of the number two.
To this third Republic, a central and creative moment, Pierre Nora showed a great deal of interest and even tenderness: commending those who then worked to repair the revolutionary fracture, teaching students all that in ancient France was secretly preparing modern France and offering them a unified version of their history.
But this peaceful identity was only once.
This is again in debate, accompanied by a new type of immigration, threatened by the rise of minority claims, absorbed into the European space.
The book therefore offers both the fascinating portrait of France that leaves and the circumspect sketch of France that comes.
With, in the first place, the portrait of the historian, who should reserve a few surprises.
We found out that the chimney was a housekeeper.
The man of multiple curiosities turned, slightly obsessive, around the same idea.
The windshield was at the centre of the centre.
And the one who had deposited, here more than half a century, a topic about the idea of nation, but had escaped from the initial exercise of the thesis, entrusts us, like grain salt, that he will have done it.
True in a less steep, more bursting and more subtle form.
But we're not mistaken, just as binding.
For far more than the prescribed figure of the university course, this thesis states the inner necessity of a life.
A former hostage in Lebanon: "The return is complex enough to manage"
Removed from Beirut on March 8, 1986, with three members of his team of "Antenna 2" filming a Hezbollah demonstration, journalist Jean-Louis Norman was released about 21 months later, on November 27, 1987.
Retired since 2008, he has been involved in the establishment of the Hostages of the World Hostage Association, which he has been chairing for several years.
Its main objective: to obtain the opportunity for hostages to bring complaints and bring their hostages to the International Criminal Court.
Held more than 1,000 days, the four hostages of Aqmi (Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb) Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Pierre Legrand and Marc Féret were released on Tuesday.
After medical examinations at the Val-de-Grice Military Hospital Wednesday afternoon, they have since been able to find their families.
And try, gradually, to resume their life course.
"The New Observer" asked Jean-Louis Norman, 62 years old, former major reporter, retired since 2008, president of the Association "Lotages du monde".
From the night of your release, you were on the 20h plateau of "Antenna 2".
What are your memories of your release today?
In particular, in Beirut.
When I am released, I find myself in the trunk of a car where I meet - without seeing it because it's black - Roger Water.
He tells me "we're released," but I'm not sure, and he tells me we can still be killed.
We are very excited, but very tending as well.
It is war, and those who lead us are also very tending.
They're dropping us on the edge of a sidewalk.
There are Syrian soldiers.
Then we arrive at the site of the Summerland Hotel where the press is present.
Frenchmen bring us to the embassy of France.
It's time for the first few strokes of the parents, the family, the friends, the press...
I remember taking a bath for an hour.
And having dinner in a t-shirt at the Embassy of France.
I also remember a short night to talk to Roger and Marchiani.
The tension is still there because we do not have the means to evacuate ourselves to Larnaca Airport in Cyprus.
Arrived there as a helicopter, we take a private plane that takes us back to France via Corfou and Solenzara, where Pasqua embarks.
How did your arrival take place on French soil?
We landed at Orly.
Chirac, Prime Minister, is here.
It's kind of brutal.
There's an incredible shield.
And a lot of media.
When I left there were three television channels.
I'm coming back and there's plenty of it.
The descent of the plane stairwell, I find them with my son and my parents, my friends, all of this is extremely strong in emotion.
Between the airport and at my house, many motorcycles follow our car that Roussin drives.
The motorists pull their asses to take pictures and follow me to my home where I have to do some police to prevent some from climbing.
The media pressure is enormous.
It doesn't stop, we're well placed to know...
But the state of emotion and fatigue is such that it is difficult to see clearly.
We're out of a hole and we're suddenly under the media lights.
It's a little complicated, a little violent, rather complex to manage.
But we did the hardest.
The other night, I'm at 8:00, the next day I'm on TV, too.
Then start a kind of rehabilitation to life, very gently, for a month or two that are a little like vacation.
How did medical examinations and DGSE debriefing happen?
I had the right to a first medical checkup in Corsica.
The rest was done in Val-de-Grace the following days my return: radios, all kinds of exams and meeting with a psychiatrist.
It is not a meeting that does everything but we know that we can rely on him, to remind him if necessary, that we are not delivered to ourselves.
It's part of the procedure.
I also met with intelligence.
They asked me questions about the hostage takers.
That made sense.
It didn't bother me.
How do you react today to the release of the four hostages from Niger?
I listen to what they say.
The debate on ransoms in particular.
Some things piss me off, others less.
I'm trying to share things between the questions about my past as a hostage and my jacket as president of the "Lotages of the World" association that allows me to distance myself, and it seems much more interesting to me to approach.
I wonder, for example, about the definition of resilience.
Above all, I fight with others for the recognition of the legal status of the hostage.
I think there's a semantics problem.
It is necessary to call hostages to take "political" hostages - which is the case most of the time - and allow hostages to have access to justice, bring complaints and bring their hostages to the International Criminal Court.
Today, once again, everyone is in compassion, in emotion, and rejoices at the release of these hostages.
But who says these hostages might also have access to justice?
A court in The Hague is done for this.
Why wouldn't we say to hostage-taking "you have failed the rules of war, like those of all the Geneva conventions, we're going to bring you to justice"?
It seems to me to be well-founded, legitimate, common sense.
This message is heard, but not listened, and it shocks me.
It's my main fight.
Egyptian Islamists on the street to denounce Morsi's trial
The anger is rampant in the ranks of Egyptian Islamists.
Two days before the opening of the trial of the fallen president Mohamed Morsi, they went down the streets.
Mobilization throughout Egypt to demand the re-establishment of the democratically elected first president of the country.
It is not a trial that highlights this activist of the Muslim Brotherhood.
So far no lawyer has been able to meet him and no volunteer has been able to take a copy of the case documents.
It's not a trial, it's a farce.
President Morsi's trial is a false trial involving a pro-Morsi, he is supposed to have Sisi tried, not the other way around.
Morsi must judge Sisi for the massacres of Rabaa, the Nahda massacres, and the massacre of the Republican Guard.
Sisi is a liar and a traitor.
Confrontations broke out in Alexandria, the police used tear gas, and 60 protesters were arrested.
Monday, 20,000 police officers will be deployed to Cairo Police Academy, where Mohamed Morsi will be tried.
Hagel blamed 9 U.S. States for violating homosexual rights
Since the federal state recognized homosexual marriage, "all military spouses have the right to an identity card from the Department of Defence and the benefits that come with it," said the Minister in New York in a speech before the Anti-Defamation League to fight anti-Semitism.
"But some States refuse to issue these cards to same-sex spouses in the National Guard facilities" established on their territory, he denounced, urging those States to violate federal law and the principle of equality.
Without these cards, they cannot benefit from the many social or health services provided in these bases, or access their stores.
The Secretary of Defence said that he ordered the Chief of the National Guard, General Frank Grass, to ensure the implementation of the federal law.
The Texan Fleet of the Nine States began with Texas, which refused to implement these benefits on the Texan National Guard's deployments, due to a conflict between the Texan Act and the federal gay marriage law.
He was joined in his refusal by Indiana, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Western Virginia, according to a senior defence officer.
The Pentagon estimates the population involved in the recognition of homosexual marriage to approximately 5600 active persons, including 17,000 of the National Guard, Reserve and retirees.
Sixth edition of Play Skateboard this Saturday in Hyères
The sixth edition of the Play Skateboard is held on Saturday, November 2, at the Skate Park in Hyères.
Organized by the SK8 Unity section of the Bump Association, the competition should bring together the best skaters in the region.
Registrations are held on Saturday morning from 9 a.m. and the qualification phases will begin at 10 a.m., before the final scheduled at 3 p.m. and the delivery of the prizes at 4 p.m.
The audience will be able to admire the technical challenges of young people who, for some, already attend the competitions at the highest level, similar to the young hyeroise Lorenzo Palumbo.
At only 10 years old, he has already conquered his place this year for the European Championships in Copenhagen and he does not like anything so much as to show up to competitors who exceed it by three heads.
The mayor of Toronto hunts journalists who came to ask him about a drug case
In Canada, the mayor of Toronto is suspected of drug use, according to several media reports.
A video released to justice seems to support these suspicions.
The interested person, Rob Ford, has always denied having consumed crack, while acknowledging having a penchant for cannabis.
On Thursday, he took out several journalists who had come to question him from his property.
We also believe that sometimes images do not need an explanation or comment.
A case of rabies detected in a cat in the Val-d'Oise
The authorities announced on Thursday, October 31, that a case of rabies had been detected in a kitten in the Val-d'Oise, manifestly of foreign origin while France has been free of Aboriginal cases since 2001.
The kitten was found in Argenteuil on 25 October and died on 28 October.
The rabies diagnosis was confirmed by the Pastor Institute.
"An epidemiological survey was undertaken to identify and take care of people who might have come into contact with this kitten between 8 October and 28 October included," the ministries of health and agriculture said.
"Five people who have been in contact with the kitten have already been identified" and have received preventive treatment.
"In man, the preventive treatment of human rage, administered after contact with the carrier animal, but before the onset of symptoms, is very effective," the communiqué states.
The ministries now call on those who would have been bitten, scratched, scratched, or licked on a mucous or skin damaged by this kitten or whose animal would have been in contact with this kitten between 8 and 28 October to contact on 08.11.00.06.95 between 10 and 18 hours from 1 November.
"France being free of rage since 2001, this kitten or the mother has been imported from another country, not free," according to the communiqué.
The Ministry of Agriculture states that the last "Aboriginal" case of rabies recorded dates back to December 1998 on a fox and that "France is officially declared free of this disease in November 2001 by the International Office for Epizootic Diseases (IPO)".
A case of rabies on a dog illegally imported from Gambia was registered in 2008.
"Ray is a deadly disease if it is not treated on time," the ministries recall and it is communicable for almost 15 days before the first symptoms of the disease occur.
Obama works backwards on his reform of the health system
President Obama came back yesterday to his promise without ambiguity and often repeated that "if you are satisfied with your health plan, you can keep it."
After hundreds of thousands of people received notices of termination from their claimants, Republicans criticized the president in the last few days accusing him of misleading the American people.
Yesterday, Barack Obama adjusted his original promise.
"The vast majority of people with adequate health insurance can keep it," he said in a speech in Boston.
Speaking of what he calls "a current effervescence" with regard to the terminations, President Obama encouraged Americans who received these opinions to look for new insurance on the market.
Most people will be able to obtain comprehensive and better-suited health plans for the same price, even for even less expensive than expected.
"You're going to win," he said.
The Administration announced that it should not be surprising if the 5% of the population that hire their own insurance were forced to change their plans because their coverage does not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
"Please allow me to address these Americans directly: you deserve better," Kathleen Sebelius said when he testified to the Committee on Energy and Trade in Washington.
Ms. Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said that the launch in October of the online market had failed “desolably”.
"I am as frustrated and irritated as anyone," she added.
I look forward to regaining your confidence.
It was an exasperated Kathleen Sebelius who uttered this sentence, while she believed her micro cut, addressing an assistant sitting behind her at the Assembly meeting yesterday following a controversial exchange of views with Billy Long, the Republican representative of Missouri, to know if she should join the Obamacare.
For more than three hours, Billy Long repeatedly asked Ms. Sebelius why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily renounced the government's sponsored insurance to sign a regime via HealthCare.gov, which now boasts millions of Americans.
Vettel sneezes a special helmet in Abu Dhabi
The happy choice, Jake Vite Prekop, combined the colors of the German brand and flag, while integrating the notions of speed and heat at the level of the track.
German Sebastian Vettel, the fourth World Formula 1 champion, cut off for free trials at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on Friday a special helmet whose design was made by a 21-year-old Mexican fan.
Vettel has chosen among 1,500 drawings from around the world, as part of a contest launched by one of the sponsors, a car brand, of his stable.
He was invited to follow Abu Dhabi's GP, with a friend, and so he can see the German champion, on the track and at his stand.
Vettel was supposed to wear this helmet on Friday and Saturday to the tests.
It is likely that it will have another special helmet on Sunday, for the race, to mark its fourth consecutive world title.
A resident of Aubervilliers launches his Party of the suburbs
Let's not fool ourselves.
In the spirit of Abdel-Malik Djermoune, its founder, the "Parti de la banlieue" is not addressed only to the banlieusers.
I chose a map of France as a logo, it justifies.
When I speak of suburbs, I address to all those who are excluded from the great national family.
It does not prevent its project, presented on Thursday in a press conference in its birthplace of Aubervilliers, from the desire to better defend multiculturalism, this great cultural pot meeting that characterizes the neighbourhoods.
My proposal No 1 is to create a Ministry of Multiculturalism, he says.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune, 50 years old, is now claiming as "100% apolitical" even though it has not always been neutral.
Militant in 2002 alongside Jean-Pierre Chevénement, he then supported Dominique de Villepin locally between 2010 and 2011.
I know that the values of equality I propose in my program are attached to the left, but if the right-wing people are ready to support me, I will also listen to them, he continues.
There's only the extremist parties that I'm not talking about.
In addition to multiculturalism, Abdel-Malik Djermoune has built its programme -consultable on the Internet - from many themes intended to speak to suburban residents, including young people: the right to vote for foreigners, the legalization of cannabis, the civil majority at 16 years of age, the rehabilitation of the function of housekeepers...
He remains to find candidates to form lists and defend his ideas on the political scene."For the 2014 municipal elections, this is likely to be fair, he recognizes."
It's a problem of time and money.
The suburban party should still be represented in Aubervilliers through my candidacy and I also hope in other cities.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune ensures that he already has seven list heads in Metropolitan France and Martinique.
"And the support emails that I have received since yesterday do not all come out of banlieue" he rejoices.
John Kerry, unprecedentedly admitted that American espionage "had gone too far inappropriately"
John Kerry indicated a redoubled U.S. defensive attitude towards its monitoring programs by admitting, without precedent, that on several occasions, espionage "had gone too far in an inappropriate manner."
The Secretary of State also admitted that he, like Barack Obama, had ruled on "automatic pilot" when a series of incendiary revelations by the complainant Edward Snowden about the NSA spying activities began.
The leaks put the U.S. government at the centre of a diplomatic storm with its allies.
Speaking at an intergovernmental conference in London by video link, Mr. Kerry said: "It is undeniable that the President, myself and other members of the government have learned about certain things in automatic pilot mode because we had the opportunity, from the Second World War and until the difficult years of the Cold War, and of course on 11 September."
He then became the first senior member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. espionage exceeded the borders, but insisted that everyone's rights had not been violated.
He said, "In some cases, it went too far in an inappropriate way."
And the President is determined to try to clarify and make clear to people that he was now doing a thorough review of these practices so that no one would feel deceived.
I assure you that innocent people will not be abused in this process.
However, Mr. Kerry stressed that the NSA was a force for good and that its monitoring operations had saved many lives.
He added: "We live in a new world where people are ready to jump."
There is a radical extremism in the world that is determined to try to kill people, to make them explode and attack governments.
What if you could intercept their communications and stop them before they act?
We have indeed prevented planes from falling, buildings from exploding, and people from being murdered because we have been able to get to know the facts in advance.
In the meantime, US legislators will go to Europe to address concerns about the alleged US espionage case and convince the Europeans of the need to continue their joint efforts to combat terrorism with the United States, explained the President of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut indicated that he had spoken before members of the European Parliament and others this week and that he was concerned about the threats they had made concerning a possible withdrawal of anti-terrorist organizations because of the sense of frustration caused by the supervision of the National Security Agency.
"It is really important for the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans remain on our side in the mutual commitment to the fight against terrorism," said Murphy, a democrat serving his first mandate, and president of the European Subcommittee on European Affairs of the American Senate, during an interview since Washington.
And I will go to Europe to make it clear to them that we must continue to work together to combat terrorism, despite the anger caused by the NSA programmes.
The press reports that the NSA has captured millions of communications in Europe, which has damaged relations with some allies in the United States, but the director of the agency said this week it was inaccurate and it was a misunderstanding because it was about metadata that NATO allies had collected and shared with the United States.
Other revelations reported documents disclosed by Snowden that the NSA had intercepted data and communications from the mobile phone of the German chancellor Angela Merkel and those of 34 other heads of state.
The Intelligence Director, James Clapper, justified allied espionage by indicating that it was necessary and that it was a common practice on both sides.
In this tumultuous atmosphere, Murphy indicated that his office was organizing a trip from Congress, which should take place this year, and he hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and the two chambers.
The names of other participating legislators should be disclosed in the coming days.
He indicated that the route remained to be defined.
Murphy said that the purpose of this trip was to improve relations, but also to show "affective firmness".
He explained that European Heads of State should be honest with their citizens about the type of espionage programmes they have applied for years.
"We can change our monitoring programmes to better protect European rights, but they must also understand that we are not the only ones in the world to do espionage," Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry planned to visit this weekend in the Middle East and Poland to manage the resentment generated by U.S. strategies in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as U.S. surveillance activities.
The London Stock Exchange closed down on Thursday, plummeted by Shell's bad results and following an announcement by the Fed of maintaining its support for the economy, as planned.
An Australian called for his prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old resident in Sydney, sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for falsely claiming to have been assaulted by a taxi driver, appealed the judgement and was released under bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty by a Phuket Province Court on June 15 of false statements after telling the Thai police that a local taxi driver, along with two other men who controlled her, had assaulted her earlier on Sunday, June 10.
However, video surveillance records later revealed that she had safely returned to her hotel after being separated from her little Australian friend.
Phuket's police interrogated Bamford for two days before she confessed to having invented the history of every piece.
She was detained in a local police station cell prior to the hearing before the court.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days imprisonment in a low-security detention facility on Phuket's periphery rather than in a women's prison.
This is the daughter of the former Australian Rugby League player Peter Tunks, who appealed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Canberra to help her daughter.
Tunks told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about her daughter's well-being and wanted her to return to Australia.
“We’ve obviously had a distressing time, but we hope to bring her home safely as soon as possible,” Tunks said.
Bamford appealed to the court and was released after a deposit of 50,000 bahts.
In Australia, the press said that in the meantime, it was on vacation in the Krabi region in southern Thailand.
Thai judicial sources indicated that Bamford was represented by a local Phuket lawyer, but warned that the appeal could lead to a further increase in the penalty of up to two years' imprisonment and imprisonment in an adult prison.
However, after the recent killing in Phuket of Michelle Smith, an Australian travel agent, Thailand could also seek to return its damaged image to tourists, which could lead to acquittal.
The French police will stop the supporters of Anderlecht who came otherwise than with the cars of the RSCA
The French police decided to lay strict rules concerning the meeting of the Royal Sporting Club d'Anderlecht against Paris Saint-Germain set Tuesday, communicated Marie Verbeke, the spokesperson for the Brussels-day police zone, Friday.
The Belgian supporters of the RSCA who wish to attend this meeting of the Champions League will have to use the travel system set up by the RSCA.
"The bus convoy will be escorted by the police from an old border post in Rekem to the PSG stage," the spokesperson transmitted.
The course will be the same for the return.
"If other supporters intended to travel to Paris by other means, the French Police Prefecture stated that measures have been taken to make arrests or even guard arrests," said Marie Verbeke.
Living together in French, the challenge of the school commission Marguerite-Bourgeoys
At the Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board, 62% of students have a mother tongue other than French.
This was why, a year ago, a consultation with parents, students, teachers and education staff to reflect on how to better integrate pupils who live on horseback between different cultures.
The school commission has just unveiled its vision of "Living Together in French".
The Vision diversity organization has been walking for a year in schools to help students of all backgrounds discover common benchmarks that are not limited to the French language.
The discovery of neighborhoods, our architecture, our places are landmarks.
Great names of writers, artists, be they from behind or have come from elsewhere.
Who are our builders?
"So we create projects so that they identify themselves to all of this," explains Vision President Diversity, Aïda Kamar.
Michel Venne, from the Institute of the New World, identified several challenges for the school commission.
"On transmission, for example, of what is Quebec culture, the sense of belonging, support for staff in transformations that are seen, within the student clientele," he said.
The Marguerite-Bourgeoys School Commission has created a research centre that will provide tools to teachers who, sometimes, come from elsewhere.
Rachida Azduz, from the University of Montreal, will be the scientific director.
The preparation to manage a class in a North American context, Quebec.
"Different educational strategies, that's the real need," she sums up.
Research will focus on inclusion in all its angles: linguistic, school, social and cultural.
