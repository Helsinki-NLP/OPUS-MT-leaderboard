Members of the Wales Assembly were afraid to "pass by Marretas"
There is a dismay on the part of some Members of the Wales Assembly (AM) regarding the suggestion that their title should be changed to MWP (Deputies of the Welsh Parliament).
The origin of this controversy is in the plans to change the name of the assembly to "parliamento Galês".
Some members of this House, coming from all political colors, fear that this will make them ridiculous.
A Labour AM stated that the group is concerned that "the designation remains with Twp and Pwp".
For non- Welsh readers: in the Welsh language, "twp" means "idiot" and pwp means "excrement".
A Plaid AM stated that the group in its overall "was not satisfied" and suggested alternatives.
A Conservative Member of Wales said that the group was "open-minded" in relation to the change in the name, but said that the MWP designation was verbally very close to Muppet (Marreta).
In this context, the letter w in Welsh has a similar pronunciation to that of the letter u in Yorkshire.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, currently drawing up legislation to introduce the name amendments, said: "The final decision on how Members of the House are designated will obviously be taken by themselves".
The Law of the Government of Wales of 2017 gave its assembly the powers to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which received widespread support for the proposal to designate the Assembly by 'Gallese Parliament'.
On the subject of the title of the AM, the Commission favoured "Deputies of the Welsh Parliament" or WMP, but the MWP option was more favoured in a public consultation.
Apparently, AM is suggesting alternatives, but the effort to gather consensus may constitute a headache for the President, Elin Jones, who should present a draft legislation on amendments within a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes in the way the House exercises its activities, such as rules on the disqualification of AM and the configuration of the commission system.
When they discuss the legislation, the AM will have the final word on the issue of how they should be designated.
Macedonians will refer to the change in the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday about the change in the name of their country to "the Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to resolve a conflict of decades with neighboring Greece, which integrates a province with the name of Macedonia.
Athens has long been insisting that the name of its neighbour to the north constitutes a complaint on its territory, and has repeatedly objected to its application for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, opponent of the plebiscite on the change of name, said he would ignore the vote.
However, the referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change in the name is no more than the price to be paid for EU and NATO membership.
Sinos de St. Martin is silent at a time when the churches of Harlem fight for survival
"In a historical perspective, the elderly with whom I spoke told me that there was a bar and a church in every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today, there's neither one nor another."
The disappearance of the bars, he said, understood.
"People socialize differently" today, I said.
"The bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood where people go on a regular basis."
As far as the churches are concerned, he is concerned about the eventuality of the money earned with the sale of heritage not last as long as the leaders expect" and that, sooner or later, everything will return exactly to the point of departure".
The churches, he added, can be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums inhabited by the kind of people who will not support the shrines of the neighborhood that still remain.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "and, therefore, such will hasten the arrival of the day when these churches will all close, because it is unlikely that most of those who move to these complexes will join these congregations."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist Congregation came out in the 1930 ’ s.
The building was later placed by a black congregation that carried out its worship in the immediate vicinity.
St. Martin's was occupied by a black congregation under the auspices of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott to the 125th Street tenants, an important commercial street in Harlem that resisted the hiring and promotion of black employees.
A fire in 1939 left the building severely damaged. However, when they made plans for its reconstruction, Father Johnson’s parishioners ordered the carriage.
Rev. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's, proudly called the carriage "the bells of the poor".
The expert who played the carriage in July called it "a cultural treasure" and an "unreplaceable historical instrument".
This specialist, Tiffany Ng, from the University of Michigan, also said that he was the world's first coach to be played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who moved to the largest coach in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What happened in St. Martin's in recent months was a complicated story of architects and entrepreneurs, some brought by the lay leaders of the church and others by the Episcopal diocese.
The parish council, the governing body of the parish made up of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July, expressing its concern that this "will seek to reverse its costs", a poor degree of not having been involved in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Tubarão causes 13-year-old teen injuries in a lobster hunting dive in California
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday during a lobster hunt in California on the first day of the lobster season, the authorities said.
The attack took place shortly after 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour when he heard the boy scream for help, and then rowed in his direction with a group to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said he initially thought that it was just enthusiasm for having caught a lobster, but then realized that the boy was shouting "I was bitten"!
I was bitten!
The whole area of the clavicle was dilaced, described Hammel what he observed when he arrived at the boy.
"I called everyone out of the water, "There's a shark in the water!" said Hammel.
The boy was airborne to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The lifeguard Captain Larry Giles stated in a press release that a shark had been sighted in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it was considered not to belong to a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries at the top of the trunk.
The authorities closed access from Point Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours, for research purposes and for safety reasons.
Giles reported that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with cosmetic sections like big warehouses, supported by specialist assistants.
As part of a substantial initiative to earn a share in the UK cosmetics market, estimated at £2.8 billion, which has continued to grow while sales of fashion clothing and household items go back, these major cosmetics sections will be tested in 11 shops spread across the country and will be implemented in more stores in the coming year if their success is demonstrated.
This investment in cosmetics derives from the search by supermarkets for ways to use the previously used exposure space for TVs, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury's mentioned that it would duplicate its catalogue of beauty products with the offer of up to 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing ranges of L'Oréal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with branded areas similar to those of shops such as Boots.
The supermarket network is also relaunching its Boutique makeup range so that most products obey vegan precepts, something more and more demanded by younger buyers.
In addition, the fragrance shop The Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south of London, last week. The second one, in Selly Oak, in Birmingham, is expected to open near the end of the year.
Online shopping and changing food shopping habits for small daily quantities in nearby shops have led to the need for supermarkets now to make more effort to persuade customers to visit their shops.
Mike Coupe, executive president of Sainsbury's, said that shops will increasingly look like big warehouses, at a time when the supermarket chain tries to fight off the Aldi and Lidl discount stores with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has been installing Argos sales points in hundreds of shops, having also installed a series of Habitats, since it acquired both chains two years ago, and states that this has strengthened sales of merchandise products and made the acquisitions more profitable.
The company's previous attempt to renew its cosmetics and pharmacy departments ended up in failure.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the relationship ended after a difference on the distribution of revenues from health products stores in their supermarkets.
The new strategy emerges after Sainsbury's sold its pharmaceutical business for three years with 281 points of sale to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds.
It was said by the company that Lloyds would participate in the plan by adding in four shops an extended range of luxury brands for skin care such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the appearance and essence of our cosmetic sections to provide our customers with a more pleasant environment.
We also invest in the specialized training of colleagues, who will be available to advise the customer.
Our range of brands was designed to adapt to all needs. On the other hand, the inviting environment and practical locations make us now an irresistible point for selling beauty products that breaks with the old ways of shopping".
Peter Jones "furioso" after Holly Willoughby has abandoned 11 million pound business
Peter Jones, star of Dragons Den, became "furioso" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby had abandoned a £11 million business with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for the home label and Truly accessories.
The business of both had been compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Peatrow.
The presenter of This Morning, 37 years old, announced on Instagram that she would leave the partnership.
Holly Willoughby left the star of the Dragons Den Peter Jones stranded by abandoning the lucrative brand in the last minute to focus on his new highly profitable contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Some sources claim that Jones became "furioso" when the TV's gold girl admitted, during a tense meeting last Tuesday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, in Buckinghamshire, that her new business (their value can be 1.5 million pounds), implied that she would have no time to dedicate herself to her home product brand and Truly accessories.
The business was compared to the Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and was expected to double Willoughby’s fortune, estimated at 11 million pounds.
While 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he would leave Truly, Jones caught a plane for one of his holiday homes abroad.
One source said, "Truly was by far the greatest of Holly's priorities.
It would mean the resolution of your future in the long run and it would be financial support for the next two decades.
Your decision to leave has all been absolutely startled.
No one believed what was happening on Tuesday was so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of items ready to sell at Marlow headquarters."
Experts believe that the exit of the presenter of This Morning, who is among the most lucrative stars in Britain, could cost millions to the company, given the heavy investment in products, ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and household items, and the potential for additional delays in the launch.
In addition, it may mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, with three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin, are close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp ten years ago.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52 years old, joined the project as president in March.
Couples make a vacation together and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is about to become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the presenter of the I'm A Celebrity ITV program.
A nearby source of Jones said last night that "We don't want to make comments about your business".
Hard conversation "and then we fell in love"
The US President enthusiastically mentioned the criticisms that it would be the target of the media for making a comment that some would consider "indecent of a president" and for revealing such a positive attitude with the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give in?
Trump said, in his fake voice of "telejournal pop. "
"I didn't give in to anything."
He reported that Kim was interested in a second meeting after his initial meeting in Singapore in June, highlighting that it would be a major step in the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, the negotiations for denuclearization are taking place.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, the most important North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders in the UN General Assembly that the North does not see a "corresponding response" from the US to the first steps towards disarmament of North Korea.
Instead, he said, the US is pursuing sanctions to maintain pressure.
Trump adopted a more optimistic point of view in his speech at the beginning.
"It's going very well with North Korea," he said.
"We were about to go into war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this excellent relationship."
Trump said his efforts to improve relations with Kim brought positive results: the end of the rocket tests, support for the release of hostages and the return to the country of the remains of the US military.
He also defended his unusual approach when he spoke in his dealings with Kim.
"It's so easy to be worthy of a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to enter this overcrowded arena, we would have about 200 people standing right here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd directly ahead of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia cause devastation on an island, causing the death of hundreds of people
In the rescue of the Lombok earthquake, for example, it was told foreign non-governmental organizations that they were not necessary.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok had been displaced, there was no national catastrophe declared, a prerequisite for the channelling of international aid.
"Unfortunately, they were, in many cases, clear to say that they are not asking for international aid; therefore, it becomes a little difficult," said Mrs. Subung.
Although Save the Children is organizing a team that will be headed to Palu, there is still no guarantee that foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, spokesperson for the national disaster response agency, said that the Indonesian authorities are evaluating the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid effort.
Despite the constant shivers of land suffered by Indonesia, the country remains terribly ill prepared for the angers of nature.
Although they have been built in Aceh, shelters against tsunamis are not widely seen on other coastal lines.
It is likely that the apparent lack of a tsunami alarm siren in Palu, a poor degree of the validity of a warning, would have contributed to the loss of lives.
In the most favorable times, traveling among the many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on the way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of this new calamity.
President Joko Widodo, who made the improvement of the infrastructure decrepits a central part of his electoral campaign, spent enormous amounts on roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding struck Mr Joko's executive at a time when he faced his re-election next year.
The president is also under pressure from the persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1000 people died and tens of thousands were displaced as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using catans, arches and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
View: Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool makes a long finish for the tie golo against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved a Liverpool from a defeat in the Premier League against Chelsea, with a goal at the 89th minute on Saturday, at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he was about 30 meters from Chelsea's beacon, with his team losing for 1-0.
You hit your left before you finish towards the second beam.
In the attempt, the ball flew high over the large area by going to the upper right corner of the network.
In the end, the ball fell on a flying Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell inside the network.
"I was just trying to reach this position, to go to the ball, and players like Shaq advance as much as possible, so I was just gaining as much time as possible," Sturridge said to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, I made a call, and I didn't think too much about it. I just finished."
Chelsea won by 1-0 at the interval after marking a goal in the 25th minute of the Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In this play, the advance of the blues gave a step of heel back to Mateo Kovacic before detaching near the midfield and performing a sprint towards the Liverpool area.
Kovacic made a quick midfield pass.
Then he made a fine finish that crossed the opposite defense, leading Hazard to the great area.
He overstepped the defenses and went against the second network with an end to his left foot that passed through Liverpool's Alisson Becker Network.
Liverpool faces Naples in the Champions League group phase at 3 p.m. on Wednesday afternoon, at St. Paul's Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton at the UEFA Europe League at 3 p.m. on Thursday afternoon in London.
Number of tsunami deaths in Indonesia up to 832
The number of deaths in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, declared the country's disaster response agency at the beginning of Sunday.
There are reports that describe a large number of people imprisoned in the wreckage of buildings that collapsed during the magnitude 7.5 earthquake on Friday, which triggered waves that reached the height of 6 meters, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the agency, at a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with the rubble of the buildings that were demolished.
Police arrests 32-year-old man for suspicion of murder after a woman has been stabbed to death
A murder investigation was initiated after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old victim was found at 7:55 a.m. with gunshot wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, having a 32-year-old man been arrested for suspected murder.
The police urged the area population to have witnessed something to provide information.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at an early stage, but I would like to appeal to all who were in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead and who witnessed something suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to appeal to those who may have obtained images with cameras, particularly taxi drivers, that contact us, as they may have crucial information for the investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was resident in Birkenhead and was located within a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe to know the victim went to the scene of the occurrence to inquire about where she had been found this morning.
Investigations are under way, and the police report that they are currently informing the relatives close to the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to access his apartment, but was informed by the police that entrances or exits from the building are prohibited.
When he was informed about what had happened, he ran out of words.
Residents are now being informed that they can only return to their homes in hours.
A police officer was heard to tell a man that the whole area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene bathed in tears.
He repeatedly says, "it's so horrible."
At two o'clock in the afternoon, two police wagons were inside the cordon and the other one was parked in the area immediately outside.
A series of police officers were posted inside the cordon to monitor the apartment building.
We ask those who have information contacting DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers by number 0800 555 111 indicating registration 247 of 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell of Parliament has become the most recent monument swallowed up by the content of "historical revisionism"
His removal would constitute an act of poetic justice for his destruction, which recalls the perpetration of the Taliban, of so many English cultural and religious artifacts, and which was carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
However, Cromwell Society described Crick's suggestion as "a madness" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of Cromwell Society, stated: "It was inevitable that, in the current debate on the removal of statues, that Oliver Cromwell's figure next to the Westminster Palace would become a target to slaughter.
The iconoclasty of the British civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell is being sacrificed by the acts of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is a testimony to the views of the 19th century and historiography regarding a figure that many still believe to be worthy of honor.
Goldsmith said to Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressures, in his case, of course, monarchy.
Whether this constitutes an entirely accurate description is the subject of a continuing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and that Cromwell is a figure with individual notoriety that represents one side of this division.
Your successes while Lord Protector are also worthy of honor and commemoration."
Murdered pig attacks and kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to reports of local media.
The man, identified only by his so-called "Yuan", was found dead, with a blood covered artery, near a pocilga in the market in Liupanshui, in Guizhou province, read at the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
The piggrower prepares to inject swine vaccines into a pig farming on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
According to reports, he has traveled with the cousin from nearby Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found a door for an open neighbor.
In that little jar, he said, there was a big male pig with blood in his mouth.
A forensic analysis confirmed that the pig, with 227 kilos, had attacked the piggrower to death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were covered with blood and crushed, said the cousin, referred to by his nickname "Wu", according to Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed their pigs.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man does not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been closed to prevent other people from attacking while the police collected evidence at the scene.
Reports state that Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for their death.
Although rare, cases of pigs' attacks on humans have already been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in his farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years before, a pig with 300 kilos immobilized a Welsh farmer against his tractor until the woman managed to startle the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the smell of blood can work as "stimulus".
"They're just kidding.
They like to pinch, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
We just need to show them proper respect," he said.
Burial debris Rosa should bring widespread strong rain to the southwest of the United States
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is weakening when moving on the coldest waters of the north coast of Mexico.
However, it will bring torrential rains all north of Mexico and southwest of the United States in the coming days.
At 5:00 a.m., Eastern Time of Sunday, the Rosa caused raffles of 137 km/h, a category 1 hurricane, located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
However, it begins to take shape a depression over the Pacific Ocean that travels to the west coast of the United States. As it approaches the Baja California Peninsula, the Rosa, now a tropical storm, will begin to push a strong tropical humidity northward in the southwestern part of the United States.
On Monday, it will cause precipitation that can reach 25 mm in certain areas of Mexico.
At that time, tropical humidity to interact with depression in approach will produce strong rains widespread in the South-West in the coming days.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 mm of rain may cause sudden hazardous floods, crushed by debris and possibly landslides in the desert.
The strong tropical humidity will cause precipitation that can reach 5 to 7 mm in point zones, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected up to 5 to 10 mm of precipitation in southwest areas, especially on much of Arizona.
Sudden floods are possible with conditions in rapid worsening due to the dispersed nature of tropical rains.
It is highly disagreeable to walk in the desert on foot with the threat of tropical rains.
Strong rainfall can make the skids turn into brave rivers and the thunderstorms will bring strong winds and dust clouds.
The depression in approach will bring with it strong precipitation over parts of the coastline of southern California.
Total precipitations of more than 12 mm are possible, which may cause small jams of debris and slippery roads.
This may be the first precipitation of the wet season of the region.
Some scattered tropical waters will begin to occur in Arizona at the end of Sunday and at the beginning of Monday, before the rain becomes more dispersed at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
The strong rain will spread on the Four Corners on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
The month of October can show strong temperature variations throughout the U.S. territory as the Arctic cools. However, tropical areas will remain quite mild.
Sometimes this leads to drastic changes in temperature within short distances.
There is an excellent example of the drastic differences in temperature throughout the central area of the United States on Sunday.
There is a difference of almost 11 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, persistent summer heat will tend to increase and widen again.
It is expected that much of the central and eastern part of the United States will register a hot start of October, with widespread temperatures between 27 and 30 degrees from the South plains to parts of the Northeast.
The city of New York can reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 5.5 degrees above average.
Our forecast of the long-term time indicates a high probability of the occurrence of temperatures above average in the eastern part of the United States until the end of the first half of October.
More than 20 million people attended Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people attended yesterday in six television stations to the raptist witness of Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court, and the woman who accused him of sexual abuse allegedly occurred in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
However, the political impasse continued, with the stations interrupting regular programming due to a last-minute turnaround: an agreement drawn up by the Senator of Arizona Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee that he is absolutely certain that Kavanaugh slapped her while drunk and tried to throw her off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an inflamed witness, said he is absolutely certain that this did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people, number determined by Nielsen on Friday, attended the hearing.
The company accounted for the average number of viewers in CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC chains.
The numbers of the other stations that transmitted it, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not yet available.
In addition, Nielsen generally has difficulties in measuring audiences of those who see programs in offices.
To give some perspective, this is a level of hearings similar to the end of an American football game or the Oscar ceremony.
Fox News Channel, whose commentators gave his strong support to the Kavanaugh nomination, led all television stations with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the audience that lasted all day, referred to Nielsen.
The ABC was second with 3.26 million spectators.
Then comes CBS with 3.1 million, NBC with 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million and CNN with 2.52 million, said Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure of Friday's drama.
After the cabinet of the moderate republican had issued a statement stating that his vote would be in favour of Kavanaugh, the senator was caught by the Chambers of CNN and CBS on Friday morning to be verbally attacked by protesters when he tried to enter an elevator to address a hearing of the Judicial Commission.
The senator remained motionless to look down on the floor while he was directly criticized for the CNN cameras.
"I'm here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?
He was told that "you have power while so many women have no power."
Flake said his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator door closes, that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcasting stations were all covering the event in direct hours later, when the Judicial Commission voted to make the appointment of Kavanaugh to proceed to a vote in plenary session of the Senate.
However, Flake said he would only do so on the understanding that the FBI would investigate charges against the nominee for the next week, something that the democratic minority had come to demand.
Flake was partly convinced after conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and later with some other senators, he made his decision.
Flake's choice was decisive, since it was clear that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
Prime Minister May accuses critics of "polyticizing" with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of his plans to leave the European Union of "polyticizing" with the future of Great Britain and of damaging national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
Theresa May, British Prime Minister, arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview to which he gave on the front page of the newspaper, his former foreign minister Boris Johnson reinforced his attack on what is known as the Minister's "Chequers Plan" for Brexit, stating that a proposal which provides that Britain and the EU cover the charges on the other side is "totally absurd".
Wayde Sims Homicide: Police Stop Suspect Dyteon Simpson Killing LSU Player · Global Voices
The police arrested a suspect of Sims' deadly shooting, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, was arrested and charged with second-degree homicide, according to a statement from Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered them at the scene and said they had found Simpson's DNA in them, reports to WAFB, a subsidiary of CBS.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he had fatally hit Wayde with a firearm.
A bond of $350,000 has been established, the lawyer said.
The medical-legal office of the parish of East Baton Rouge issued a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a bullet wound in the head extending to the neck.
The department reports that the collaboration of the action group of the Louisiana State Police, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, the Southern University Police and residents of the area who collaborated in the investigation led to this arrest.
The athletic director of LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the authorities in the area for his "diligence and effort to obtain justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
This advanced, 1,98 m tall, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
Its average was 5.6 points and 2.6 points per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU Will Wade's basketball coach said the team was "devasted" and "in shock" for Wayde's death.
"That's what worries us in permanence," Wade said.
Axle-ejected volcano in Mexico City
Ashes emanating from the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern districts of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for the Prevention of Disasters advised Mexicans to stay away from the volcano on Sunday after a resumption of the activity in the crater, which recorded 183 emissions of gas and ashes within 24 hours.
The center detected numerous deaf noises and tremors.
Images on social networks showed fine layers of gray covering the windshields of automobiles in neighborhoods of Mexico City as Xochimilco.
The geophysicians recorded an increase in the volcanic activity, located 72 kilometres from the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake shook Mexico's central area in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Confrontations between police and Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after clashes between independent protesters and the intervention police, while thousands of people joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizing Catalan referendum on the secession.
A group of masked separatists, caught by the intervention police, struck her with eggs and threw ink into powder, creating dark dust clouds in streets that are usually filled with tourists.
There were also later clashes, in which the police resorted to sticks to contain the conflicts.
For a few hours, independent groups singing "We don't forget, we don't forgive" faced unionist protesters, who shouted "Long Life for Spain".
Fourteen people were treated with mild injuries suffered in protests, can be read in the local press.
The tensions remain high in the region inclined to independence, one year after the referendum of October 1 which was considered illegal by Madrid, but which was held by Catalan separatists.
The voters chose overwhelmingly independence, although the turnout at the polls had been low, with a majority boycott of those against.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1000 people were injured last year after the police tried to block the current vote at polls spread across the region, resulting in violent confrontations.
The independent groups had camped during the night on Friday to prevent a demonstration of support for the national police.
Although it was performed, this manifestation was forced to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had hopes that Catalonia would become independent.
"Last year, we lived our best moments.
I saw my parents cry with joy for voting, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite having won a vital but tangible victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan independenceist parties have had difficulties in maintaining the momentum this year, with their most well-known leaders in voluntary exile or in detention awaiting trial for their role in the referendum organization and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who was protesting in support of the police with her phone, said that the conflict was fuelled by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who had been awaiting trial since last year, announced that he would apply to the European Parliament in the elections next year.
"Presenting me as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression we have seen on the part of the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car crashing against a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car had repeatedly struck a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m., British summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage occurred in the gates and in the building itself.
At a certain point, someone may also have shot a beast against the car.
Menga attack gives 1-0 victory to Livingston against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ensured victory
Livingston, promoted to the first division, spooked the Rangers and gave Steven Gerard the second defeat of only two in 18 games as an Iberox club technician.
Dolly Menga's attack made a difference, at a time when Gary Holt's team changes from level, with Hibernian in second place.
The team of Gerrard, who continues without a home victory in the first division this season, faces the leaders of Hearts, with eight more points, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers will face at home the Rapid Vienna on the Europe League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston extended to six games his succession of clashes without defeats in the division, with main coach Holt without losing a single time since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston loses opportunities against staggered visitors
Holt's team should have moved forward in the score long before the goal, because the incisive character of his game was causing all kinds of problems to Rangers.
Scott Robinson penetrated the defense, but he let himself be dragged in front of the beacon and then Alan Lithgow managed only to steer his efforts away after he had slipped to find Craig Halkett's headlight on the beacon.
The home team was pleased to let Rangers play in front of her, knowing that it could cause trouble for visitors on the ball-stop games.
And that's how the crucial goo arose.
The Rangers granted a free and Livingston got an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson coordinated to make the pass to Menga, which gave a touch and scored from the center of the big area.
At that point, the Rangers dominated the possession of the ball, but faced a defense of the impenetrable house team, and the storekeeper Liam Kelly had no big problems.
This pattern continued in the second part, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly into a defense.
Scott Pittman was frustrated by the feet of the Rangers Network Guard, Allan McGregor, and Lithgow gave a far-off touch from another livenston ball game stop.
Crosses continued to come to the large Livingston area, which were successively resolved, and two claims of great penalty, one after Halkett's investment on the Glenn Middleton substitute and another after one hand, were refused by the referee.
Livingston "phenomenal" - analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They were excellent without exception, continuing to overcome the expectations in this ascending trajectory.
His style of play and the staff have changed little since his return to the great teams, but it is necessary to praise Holt for the way he galvanized the eleven since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was colossal, achieving an extremely well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall giving his best throughout the game.
Anyway, Rangers revealed little inspiration.
Despite the excellent quality demonstrated at times with Gerrard, the team was far short of these standards.
His final play was little inspired (only once they were able to open the house team), constituting a kind of warning for the Rangers, which is in the middle of the table.
Erdogan is received ambiguously in Cologne
There were smiles under a blue sky on Saturday (September 29) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for a breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, whose aim is to repair relations between NATO allies.
The dispute involved issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's access to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to inaugurate a new giant mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside your country.
The police claimed security reasons to prevent a crowd of more than 25 000 people from meeting in front of the mosque, but many supporters made their presence in the vicinity to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, were also heard, condemning both the policies of the president and the decision of the German government to welcome him in the country.
The antagonistic protests reflect the divisionist character of a visitor hailed as a hero by some German Turks and hated as an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in collision with automobile
A cyclist died in a collision involving a car in London.
The accident occurred near the Bestwood Street crossing with Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, south-east of the city, about 10:15 a.m., British summer time.
The driver of the car stopped and a rescue team intervened, but the cyclist died on site.
This collision occurs months after another cyclist's death in a flight crash on Childers Street, about a mile and a half of the Saturday accident.
The Metropolitan Police stated that agents are trying to identify the person and inform their families.
Barriers and deviations for buses were placed, and drivers were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six agents injured in disturbances
Six prison agents were injured in disturbances in a high-security male prison, said the Prison Office.
The disturbances, which are still going on, started at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire about 9:30 am, the time of the British summer on Saturday.
Special agents were called "Tornado" to solve the problem, which involves eight prisoners and is restricted to a wing.
The agents were treated with small facial injuries on site.
A Prison Service spokesperson said: "Specially trained teams were used to solve the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated with injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and it must be clear that the names of those responsible will be communicated to the police and they will be able to spend more time behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin houses over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had to receive hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
In addition, last October, intervention police officers were called to resolve a serious disturbance in which personnel were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (dry-affected areas can benefit)
It is rare a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but it is exactly what is expected by the beginning of the next week, when the remaining energy of the hurricane Rosa crosses the Southwest Desert, implying the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued sudden flooding warnings for Monday and Tuesday, for the southern and eastern areas of Nevada, for southern California and for Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa assumes a direct trajectory on Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching at the end of Monday with rains.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix reported on a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones had maintained a tropical storm or depression within a radius of 300 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that passed 60 km from the Arizona border."
The most recent models of the National Center of Hurricanes predict 5 to 10 mm of precipitation, with isolated quantities that can reach the 15 mm in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other areas of the Southeast Desert, such as the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin may receive 3 to 5 mm, with the possibility of total isolates that can reach 10 mm.
For those not affected by the risk of sudden flooding, the rain of Rosa may constitute a blessing, as the region is affected by the drought.
Although the floods are a very serious concern, part of this precipitation can be beneficial, because the southwest is currently being affected by the drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40% of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, the second most serious category," reported the siteweather.com.
First, the Rosa hurricane will reach the continental mass through the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still with hurricane force on Sunday morning, with winds at maximum speeds of 137 km/h, is 619 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, so it's weakening.
Thus, it is expected to reach the coastal area in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or at the fall of Monday night.
Heavy rainfall may occur in parts of Mexico, which poses a significant risk of flooding.
"Total precipitation is expected from 8 to 10 mm from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with a maximum of 25 mm," said the siteweather.com.
The Rosa will then head north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression. It will then head south of Utah in the last hours of Tuesday night.
"The main expected danger of Rosa or her debris is the very high precipitation in Baja California, in the northwest of Sonora, and in the south-west desert of the United States," said the National Hurricane Center.
It is expected that these rains produce sudden and slumped floods of debris in the deserts, with risk of life, and allusions on mountainous terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four arrested for attempted murder
Three male adolescents and one 20-year-old man were arrested for suspected murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with gunshot wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the area of the Excelsior Terrace of Midsomer Norton, near 4h00, time of British summer on Saturday.
It was transported to the hospital, where it remains "stable".
During the night a 17-year-old, two-year-old and a 20-year-old man in Radstock area reported to the police from Avon and Somerset.
The agents appealed to everyone who could have cell phone footage of the success.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "was the victim of malice and anger" by the Democratic Party
"A vote by Judge Kavanaugh is a vote of rejection of the relentless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling in Western Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "was the victim of malice and anger" of the Democratic party during his appointment process.
Kavanaugh witnessed before the Congress on Thursday, having strongly and emotionally denied an accusation by Christine Blasey Ford that she had sexually abused her for decades when both were teenagers.
Ford also gave testimony at the hearing on his claim.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people witnessed Kavanaugh's brilliantness, quality and courage on that day.
"A confirmation vote by Judge Kavanaugh is a confirmation vote of one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a brilliant public service curriculum," said the multitude of Western Virginia supporters.
The president later referred to the appointment of Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of republican influency at the polls in the mid-term elections.
"We are five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm actually running," he said.
"That's why I'm all over the world fighting for excellent candidates."
Trump argued that Democrats are on a mission of "resistance and obstruction.
The first procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh is scheduled to take place no later than Friday, said to CNN a leading deputy of the leadership of the Republican Party.
Hundreds of earthquake and tsunami deaths in Indonesia; the number continues to rise
At least 384 people died, many of them dragged by the giant waves that hit the beaches, when a great earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, the authorities reported on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves up to six meters high hit the beach at dusk, dragging many to death and causing a trail of devastation on their way.
The tsunami occurred following an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still in their activities on the beach and did not flee immediately, having been victims of the success," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency spokesman for minimizing the effect of the Indonesian catastrophes (BNPB) in a communication in Jacarta.
"The tsunami did not move alone: it dragged cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on the ground," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami was moving in the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h before reaching the coastline.
Some people stepped on trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photographs published by the agency show many destroyed buildings and shops, deformed and slaughtered bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The coastal city continued to be shaken by replicas on Saturday.
The earthquake series was felt in an area with 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) reported in a statement that the energy released by the huge wave of Friday was about 200 times the power of the Atomic Bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have amplified the size of the tsunami, read in the statement.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the debris of the demolished buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and damage can be deeper along the coastal line 300 km north of Palu, an area named Donggala, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications "were totally incapacitated and there was no information" about Donggala, said Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 inhabitants in the area," said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it may get much worse," he said.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not reporting that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the authorities claimed that the waves emerged at the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur film released on social networks, one can see a man on the upper floor of a building shouting frantic warnings that the tsunami was approaching, for the people on the street below.
In a space of minutes, a water wall fell on the coast, dragging buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately confirm the authenticity of the filming.
The earthquake and tsunami caused an extensive energy cut that interrupted communications in the Palu area, which made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate their rescue efforts.
The army began sending cargo aircraft with the help of Jacarta and other cities. However, the evacuated still desperately need food and other basic products.
The city airport was reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo made a visit to Palau evacuation centers on Sunday.
The number of tsunami deaths in Indonesia increases exponentially to over 800.
It's very bad.
Although he managed to get safely to the city of Palu, where employees are housed in canvas shelters mounted in the courtyard of his offices, the World Vision staff of Donggala went through devastation scenes on their way, said Mr. Doseba.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when the aid groups began to initiate the gloomy tasks of assistance to the victims of the disaster, some complained that the highly experienced foreign aid workers were being prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, financing, supplies and foreign personnel can only have access to the site if it is declared a "national disaster zone".
That hasn't happened yet.
"It's still at a level of provincial catastrophe," said Auli Arriani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"What the government says is "OK, this is a national catastrophe" can open the doors to international assistance, but this status does not exist yet."
When falling on the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and relatives of the still missing still had the hope that their loved ones would be part of the miracles that mitigated the dark blankets of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a boy was removed from a sewer.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been trapped in the rubble for two days next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of his missing sportsmen for the Asian Games, completed at the beginning of this month in Indonesia.
Other of the prisoners at Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were their students.
"As a paragliding senior practitioner, I have to carry my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon said that, in the hours after the news of the collapse of Hotel Roa Roa began to circulate among the paragliding community, he desperately sent messages at WhatsApp to the sportsmen of Palu, who were participating in the festival on the beach.
However, their messages produced only a gray mark rather than a pair of blues.
"I think that means the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thieves carry $26,750 during automatic cash replenishment in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's official who replenished an automatic box in Newport on the Levee, according to a statement from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car was emptying an automatic box in the diversity complex and preparing to introduce more money, says Detective Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
While he was busy, another man "went running behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money that was destined for a delivery.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing from the premises, according to the statement, but the police did not specify the number of those involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identities should contact the Newport police by number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
In announcing this change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The Being formerly known by Kanye West".
West, 41 years old, has recently received Ye's nickname and used it as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before you participate in the Saturday Night Live, where you are expected to present your new Yandhi album.
This intervention is intended to replace that of the singer Ariana Grande, who canceled it for "emotional reasons", reported the creator of the show.
Being at the same time an abbreviation of his current professional name, the word has to him a religious meaning, according to West.
"I think "ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you," West said at the beginning of this year, when he commented the title of his album with the radio host Big Boy.
"So, I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It comes from Kanye, which means "the only", for only Ye - being just a reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is another reflection of who we are."
Kanye is part of a series of famous rappers who changed their names.
Sean Combs was alternately known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
Former collaborator of West, JAY-Z, also used variations of his name with or without hyphen and capital letters.
In Mexico, AMLO undertakes not to resort to military action against civilians
Mexican elected president Andres Manuel López Obrador committed himself not to use military force against civilians, at a time when the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students.
López Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza "never use the army to suppress the Mexican people."
Military fired a peaceful demonstration on the square on October 2, 1968, resulting in a number of deaths that may have risen to 300, when leftist student movements were deployed throughout Latin America.
López Obrador committed to supporting young Mexicans by granting them monthly subsidies to those who study and open more public universities.
The president said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities drag young people into gangs of criminals.
The US should double the financing of artificial intelligence
At a time when China reinforces its activity in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double its research expenditures in this field, said the investor and professional of Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments occur after several U.S. government departments have made announcements related to AI, although the country does not have a comprehensive formal strategy in this area.
However, China presented its plan last year: it intends to lead innovation in AI by 2030.
"Duplicating the research budget in AI would be a good start, as all other countries are so behind the US and we are looking for the new revolution in AI," Lee said.
Duplicate funding may double the chances of the next great success of AI being achieved by the United States, Lee told NBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Innovation Ventures, a company that has invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that defeated the most well-classified American player in Othello. Later, he played executive roles at Microsoft Research and was president of the Google branch in China.
Lee gave credit to the previous technological contests of the U.S. government such as Robotics Challenge of the Department of Defense Agency for Advanced Research Projects and asked when he would be next, to help identify the next visionaries.
US researchers often have to make a big effort to obtain state funding, Lee said.
"It's not China that's stealing academic leaders; it's companies," he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technological companies have hired luminaries from universities to work in AI.
Mr Lee said that immigration policy changes could also help the US to step up its efforts in the field of AI.
"I am of the opinion that green cards should be automatically granted to doctors in AI," he said.
The Chinese State Council presented its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The Chinese National Natural Sciences Foundation provides funding to people in academic institutions in a similar way to that used by the National Science Foundation and other governmental organizations to finance researchers in the United States. However, the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Centre, which is intended to involve partners in industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of the Restricted Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, DARPA announced this month an investment of $2 billion in an initiative designated by AI Next.
As regards NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million per year in AI research.
However, the US legislation that wanted to create a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has not been moving forward for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on the change of country name
The Macedonians voted on Sunday to decide on the change in the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", an initiative that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that blocked its applications for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which is part of a province called Macedonia, insists that the name of its neighbor to the north represents a complaint about its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the proposal for a new name, but the nationalist opponents argue that the change would be a blow in the ethnic identity of the majority Slavic population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether the voter turnout would be sufficient to meet the required 50% for the referendum to be valid.
The referendum question was: "Is it in favour of entry into NATO and the EU with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to continue the efforts of EU-NATO agencies for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I come today to vote for the future of our country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live free under the auspices of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, a sufficient number of members of parliament said that it would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The National Elections Committee stated that there had been no record of irregularities until one afternoon.
However, the turnout was only 16%, compared to the 34% obtained in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters came to vote.
"I came to vote for my children; our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a capital elector, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko vote in the referendum on the change in the name of the country, which would open the doors for its accession to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
Before the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of the tents mounted by those who will boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to stick to the door and not the door of service," said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If you don't want to receive us as Macedonia, we can go to others like China and Russia to become part of Eurasian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said that entry into NATO will bring much-needed investments to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of over 20%.
"I believe that the overwhelming majority will be in favour, because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
According to him, a "yes" would be the "confirmation of our future".
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Political Research Institute revealed that between 30 and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, a value lower than the required turnout.
Another poll, conducted by Telma TV from Macedonia, found that 57% of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote yes.
For the success of the referendum, the turnout must be greater than 50% plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would represent the first important gap in pro-Western government policy since it took possession in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City crosses the entire Brighton defense towards the golo
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling left Brighton's defense in victory for 2-0 against Manchester City on Saturday, at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
It made it look ridiculously easy in your gol in the minute 65.
The state-of-the-art Argentineian received a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the game.
It performed a sprint between three Brighton defenses before cutting to reach open field.
It was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He ended a defense before neutralizing others in the race within the boundaries of the large Brighton area.
Then he took a pass to his left, where Sterling was.
The advanced English used his first touch in the big area to return the ball to Aguero, who, with the right boot, defeated Brighton Mathew Ryan's bodyguard with an end to the right side of the network.
"Aguero is struggling with some foot problems," I told reporters Pep Guardiola, City coach.
"We said he would play for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky for him to have scored a goal at the time."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League confrontation.
That golo was marked at the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball well on Brighton's territory in this play.
He took a step over the defenses along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
This gave some touch before driving Sterling towards the second beam.
The advanced Sky Blues kicked the ball into the net immediately before sliding out of the field limits.
The City faces Hoffenheim in the Champions League group phase at 12.55 p.m. on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to make it hard for the Rockies to live
With the Nationals removed from the end, there were not many reasons to force another beginning.
However, the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to join the camp on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are implications for the Rockies, who hold a leadership of a game about the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies were at least lucky with a 5-2 win against the Nationals on Friday night, but they still intend to secure their title of the first division.
"Even if we are playing for nothing, at least we can go into the field knowing that the environment here in Denver, with the crowd, the other team will probably play to the maximum level that I could face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in those conditions?"
The Nationals have not yet announced the lead launcher for Sunday, but some say they are inclined to allow Scherzer to make the launches in this situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th inception, did a bullpen session on Thursday and would launch in his normal position on Sunday.
The right player in Washington goes with 18-7, with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 tickets this season.
Trump makes a comedian in Western Virginia
The president later referred to the situation involving his choice for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while mentioning the importance of republican turnout in the interim elections.
"Everything we did is at stake in November.
We are five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is one of the big, big... I'm not running, but I'm running and that's why I'm fighting for excellent candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump went on, "They're seeing this horrible, horrible group of radical democrats, they're seeing it happen right now.
And they're determined to regain power by using all the necessary means.
They don't care who they're making, who they have to go over to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, and we're not going to give it to them."
The Democrats, he said, have a mission to "resist and obstruct."
"And they have seen it in the last four days," he said, calling it "aggressive, evil, deaf and liars" to the Democrats.
The President referred to him as Dianne Feinstein, a member of the Senate's Judicial Committee, and he received great public sounds.
"Remember your answer?
Did you cause the document to escape?
Hey, what, what?
No, hm no, I, wait, one - that was a body language even bad - the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer inclusive.
It is intolerant to those who openly give their opinion
When Momentum activists from my local partisan organization voted to censure me, it was not a surprise to me.
At the end of the day, I am the latest of a number of Labour Members in the parliament to whom it has been said that they are not welcome - all because we openly express our views.
My colleague in Parliament Joan Ryan was the target of a similar treatment because he resolutely faced anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically similar issues for which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notification for the Nottingham East working meeting in the sixth fair mentioned that "we intend that the meetings be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as a local labour representative in parliament, the meetings of the General Committee were exactly that.
Unfortunately, today it is no longer the tone of many of the meetings and the promise of "most kind and gentle" policy has been long forgotten, if ever it has been realized.
It has become increasingly apparent that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and that each opinion is judged whether or not it is acceptable by the leadership of the party.
This began shortly after Jeremy took the lead, because the colleagues with whom he thought shared a similar political perspective began to expect me to turn around and to assume positions that he would never agree with - whether they were on national security or on the EU's single market.
Whenever I speak in public (and it doesn't really matter what I say), there is a stream of insults on social networks that call for "department", denouncing the policies of the center, telling me that I must not belong to the Labour Party.
And I'm not the only one going through this.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since the comments that are being addressed to me tend to be of a political nature.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of these colleagues who face a dam of sexist or racist insults every day, but who never turn back to them.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this age of politics is how these levels of insult have become normalised.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we have stopped being inclusive, and with each motion of "censorship" or modification of the rules of selection the party narrow its views.
I have received numerous counsels over the past two years urging me to keep my head low, not to be so expressive, and so would "do everything well" for me.
But that's not why I came to make politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, driven by the negligence of the Thatcher government that left the classroom of my comprehensive school literally in rubble, I sought to fight for better public services for those they most need, whether as a mayor or as a minister in government.
I've never hidden my policies, including in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could have been somewhat confused about my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
For those who promoted the motion on Friday, all I have to say is that when the country turns to a Brexit that will harm families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on the subject of my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the message I have is not for the Momentum of Nottingham; it is for my constituents, members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threats of "department" or political files will prevent me from acting in the sense of what I believe to be the interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: the unbeatable Ayr goes to the top
Two late essays somehow sent the result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this incredibly interesting game of the Tennent's Premiership of the day.
The team is now at the top of the table, the only ten without defeat.
In the end, it was a superior defense and better risk management that made the home team get the better, and Coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
"We have been tested in our games so far and remain unbeatable, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "The merit goes to Ayr. They managed the risks better than we did."
Grant Anderson's 14th minute essay, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr on the front, but a yellow card to the Scottish captain Rory Hughes, given to the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to give expression to the numbers, and Jason Baggot took advantage of a non-converted essay.
Climo extended the Ayr's advantage with a great penalty, before, immediately before the mid-time, having marked and then converted a solo test to place the marker nos. 17-5 to the Ayr at the interval.
However, Melrose began well the second part and Patrick Anderson's trial, converted by Baggot, reduced the disadvantage to five points.
A long interruption was followed due to a severe injury of Ruaridh Knott, which was transported from maca to the outside and, after the restart, Ayr reinforced the leadership with a trial of Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
The captain of the exercising Ayr, Blair Macpherson, then received a yellow card and, once again, Melrose took advantage of the numerical advantage with a non-converted Bruce Colvine trial at the end of an intense pressure investment.
However, the home team returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for overthrowing Climo without the ball, in the release of penalty, MacPherson placed the ball on the ground behind the maul in progress of Ayr.
Climo converted, as he had done almost immediately after the reboot, after Kyle Rowe had picked up David Armstrong's kick box and sent the wing Gregor Henry to the fifth essay of the home team.
Still Game star ready for a new career in the restaurant business
Ford Kieran, star of Still Game, seems ready to enter the catering sector after knowing that it has been appointed director of a licensed catering company.
The 56-year-old actor represents Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, who writes and participates with the long-standing comedian partner Greg Hemphilll.
The pair announced that the ninth season, starting soon, will be the last of the series, and it looks like Kiernan is planning his life after Craigang.
According to the official records, he is director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, even though a Scottish Sun source suggested that Kiernan was trying to get involved in the "flowery business of restoration of Glasgow".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, a landless country, expects the court to reopen its path to the Pacific
Sailors patrol a naval base covered with rope in La Paz.
Public buildings feature a blue-sea flag.
The naval bases of Lake Titicaca for the Amazon bear the motto: "The sea is ours by right.
Recovering him is a duty."
Throughout Bolivia, a landless country, the memory of a lost coastline for Chile is still alive in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century, as well as the desire to sail once again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps at the highest point in decades, since Bolivia awaits a judgment of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
" Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, a positive perspective on the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will witness the sentence of the TIJ on giant screens spread across the country, hoping that the Hague court will decide in favour of their country's claim, so that, after decades of uncertain negotiations, Chile will be obliged to negotiate, granting Bolivia a sovereign way out of the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic Bolivian indigenous president, who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has a lot at stake in the Monday sentence.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," the president voted last August.
However, some analysts believe it is unlikely that the court will decide in favour of Bolivia, and that it would change little if not.
The United Nations body, based in the Netherlands, has no power to assign Chilean territory to another country and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
That the sentence of the TIJ be delivered only six months after the hearing of the final allegations indicates that the case "was not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean specialist in international law.
And far from promoting the Bolivian cause, the last four years may have harmed it.
"The question of access to the sea has been seized by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morales' belligerent rhetoric has undermined some Chilean residual goodwill, he suggested.
At a future time, Bolivia and Chile will continue their talks, but it will be extremely difficult to maintain the dialogue after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making process was unusually fast.
Next Monday he will give Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and a possibility of "ending an end to 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefits", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, was using the maritime issue as a political crutch.
Bolivia will never dispense with its right of access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The sentence is an opportunity to understand that we must overcome the past."
North Korea claims that there will be no disarmament without the country trusting in the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho stated that his nation will never dispense with its nuclear weapons if it does not trust Washington first.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
In his speech, he urged the United States to fulfill the promises they made during a Singapore summit among the leaders of rival countries.
His comments arise when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to restart nuclear diplomacy in impasse, more than three months after the Singapore summit with North Korean President Kim Jong Un.
Ri said that this is an "impossible dream" to consider that the US' continued sanctions and objection to a statement that puts an end to the Korean war will ever lead the North to kneel.
Washington was afraid to accept the statement without Pyongyang taking significant first steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism about Pyongyang actually intending to reduce an arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its safety.
Pompey plans to visit Pyongyang in the month to prepare a second Kim-Trump summit.
Fashion parades in Paris reveal the latest line of huge hats on the way to a shop near you
If you want to extend your hat collection or completely protect yourself from the sun, you don't need to look any more.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented in the pastala a series of extravagant and oversized hats for their 2019 spring-summer collections, which left the style set in Paris Fashion Week startling.
This summer, Instagram was flooded with very little practical hats and these designers sent these amazing creations to pass it.
Valentino's most outstanding piece was an extravagant bege hat adorned with a wide aba similar to a pen that flooded the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included scalded melances of jewels, a hat of wizard and even a pineapple, although they were not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks...even in carnival time.
Many of the colorful masks had cooked lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than with high seams.
One of the creations resembled diving equipment, with tube and glasses, while another looked like a melted ice cone.
And if you want to continue this huge fashion statement, you're lucky.
The watchers of style predict that these huge hats are on their way to a store near you.
Oversized hats appear effervescent on the path of the "La Bomba", the straw hat with a 61 cm aba that has been used by everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult mark behind the very little practical hat that spread across the social networks sent another great creation to the gateways: a beach bag in straw almost as large as the model in fact carrying it.
The burnt orange strip bag, adorned with stripes and a white leather grip, was the most outstanding piece of the 2019 spring-summer La Riviera collection of Jacquemus in Paris Fashion Week.
The famous designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I am waiting to see big hats and beach bags arrive at the shops for the next summer. Since the designer had so much impact, it would be difficult to ignore the search for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
The independent schools of Scotland benefit from a curriculum of academic excellence, with this trend continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional results in the exams, reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community initiatives.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (CIS), are striving to achieve the best level of service for both students and parents.
Independent schools intend to prepare their students for further education and access to universities, as well as for the career they have chosen and to take their place as global citizens.
Since this is an educational sector capable of designing and implementing a tailored school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and sought-after theme in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If we speak to a man in a language he understands, we can enter his mind.
If we speak to him in his own language, we can enter his heart."
This quote reminds us well that we cannot only rely on English when we want to create relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Based on the results of the recent exams this year, we find that the languages are at the top of the tables, with the highest utilization rates of independent schools.
A total of 68% of students studying foreign languages reached the maximum classification of A.
These data, collected at the 74 schools under the height of SCIS, demonstrate that 72% of the students obtained the maximum grade of A in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French, and 63% of those who studied Spanish also obtained an A.
This shows that Scottish independent schools are favoring foreign languages as vital skills that will undoubtedly serve children and young people in the future.
Languages, as an option, are now seen in the same way as STEM themes (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and not only.
A UK Employment and Competition Commission survey in 2014 concluded that, among the reasons for the difficulties of employers in filling vacancies, 17% were concerned with the shortage of language skills.
Therefore, learning other languages is increasingly an imperative to prepare the young generation for their future careers.
With more potential employment opportunities to demand language knowledge, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career chosen, if they have learned a second language, they will have a tangible advantage in the future with an aptitude for life like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically place a multilingual person in front of competition.
According to a survey of YouGov more than 4000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% did not speak a foreign language well enough to maintain a conversation, the French being the only language spoken by a two-digit ratio, 15%.
So investing now in language teaching is important for children today.
The domain of several languages, particularly those of developing countries, will give children the best chance of finding employment with relevance.
In Scotland, each school differs in the languages it teaches.
Some of them will focus on the most classic modern languages, while others will teach languages considered the most important for the UK for the 2020 horizon, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a set of languages to choose from in independent schools, supported by specialized teachers in the area.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a pedagogical environment that prepares children and gives them the skills necessary for success, whatever future reserves them.
It is undeniable that today, in a globalised business environment, languages continue to be of fundamental importance for the future of the country, so it is necessary to reflect it in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to make this option available with diversity and excellence for young Scottish people.
We have to do this.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron starts at the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is ending for fans who want to see LeBron James start at Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, Lakers' coach, announced that James will participate in the opening game of Sunday's pre-season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, how many minutes will you play is still to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the official Lakers website.
The Lakers' journalist Mike Trudell published a tweet stating that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training at the beginning of this week, James was asked about his plans for the calendar of six Lakers games in the pre-season.
"I don't need pre-time games at this stage of my career to be ready," he said.
Time and channel of Trump's Home YouTube in West Virginia
President Donald Trump starts a campaign round tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five scheduled events for the next week, which include stops at friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote of conformity pending for your chosen for the seat of the Supreme Court, Trump intends to strengthen support for the mid-term elections to be held soon, since Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time is Trump's start in Western Virginia tonight and how do you see it online?
Trump's party in Wheeling, West Virginia, is marked for 7 o'clock in the afternoon, Eastern Time, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's wedding in Western Virginia online below in a live YouTube broadcast.
Trump will probably address this week's hearings to Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court, who have become tense due to allegations of sexual abuse. The confirmation vote provided for in the Senate will remain on hold for a week as long as the FBI investigates.
However, the main objective of this gathering stream is to help Republicans, who face difficult elections in November, to gain some momentum.
President Trump's campaign leader stated that these five elections next week intend to "give energy to volunteers and supporters at a time when Republicans try to protect and extend the majority they hold in the Senate and in the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"The control of Congress is so fundamental to the agenda of the President that it will visit as many states as possible, as we approach the agitation of the campaign season," said a spokesperson for Trump's campaign who renounced to be quoted, told Reuters.
Marked for Wesbank Arena in Wheeling, the evening logo will attract supporters "from Ohio to Pennsylvania and get coverage of the media from Pittsburgh area," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will mark the second time this month Trump visits West Virginia, the state in which he won for over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate to the Senate of Western Virginia Patrick Morrisey, at a disadvantage in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to give him an aid in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of Western Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: the US team demonstrates that they have the strength to fight to keep the hopes alive before Sunday singles
After three uniform sessions, the Saturday afternoon forsoms could be exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The pendulum swing of the impetuous is a completely invented sport concept, but it is one in which players truly believe, and never more than in competitions like these.
So where would they say the impetuous is coming now?
"They had a six-point advantage and now they're four, so we're looking at it as a bit of an impulse, I'd say," Jordan Spieth said while he was out of the field at the end of the day.
Europe is, of course, in advantage with four points ahead and twelve more at stake.
The Americans, as Spieth states, still have some reserve energy and many reasons to feel encouraged, especially in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each of them achieved three points in four.
Spieth has been deadly from tee to green and is leading by example.
Those gucural shouts of celebration were getting higher as the round continued, with a crucial putt that made the fourth departure an all-square when he and Thomas were two holes behind in two.
His putt who won the match in the 15th produced a similar scream, that guy who reveals that he still believes that the American team is still in competition.
"We just need to focus and worry about our own game," Spieth said.
That's all that's left for each of these players.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable revelation of Ryder Cup.
The European pair, unlikely but adorable, is four in four and cannot go wrong.
The "Moliwood" was the only duet not to make a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and on the back nine Friday morning.
In this series, and given the way their energy seems to flow from and to this turbulent crowd, it consolidates the idea that they are the players to hit on Sunday, and that there is no more popular player to seal a potential European victory at the sunset in Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably, both simultaneously in different holes.
However, the speech on the glory of Europe remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson defeated Sergio Garcia, the hero of the fourballs this morning, when he teamed up with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles on the nine front lit up the Spanish and the Swedish in a hole that they were never close to leaving.
However, on Sunday, there is no one to help them get out of him.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to see closely because of interactions between partners, counsels that give or not and how strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team until now and has gained a significant advantage on the final day. However, this foursome session has also demonstrated that the US team has the stomach for the fight that some, especially in the United States, doubted it had.
Europe with 10-6 leadership on Ryder Cup's last day
Europe will enter the last day of Ryder Cup with an advantage over it after leaving the fourballs and foursomes of the Saturday departures with a 10-6 leadership in the United States.
The inspired duet of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two victories over a Tiger Woods with difficulties to reach the ranking in the Le Golf National, so far, of four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, struggling to preserve the trophy that he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team that failed in the morning fourballs, winning the series for 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the forsoms with two winning matches, but they failed to shorten the disadvantage.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points on Sunday 12 singles to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European initiator to win four points followed when he and Molinari, who received the nickname "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend, are just the only duet to win four points in their four opening matches in Ryder Cup history.
Having crushed Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they superbly consolidated the advantage, defeating an energyless Woods and American beginner Bryson Dechambeau with an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who crashed during two matches on Saturday, revealed occasional genius accesses, but has already lost 19 of the games he fought in fourballs and forsomes, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, resting during the morning fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, defeating 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, first and third ranked in the world ranking.
However, on this pleasant day with a slight breeze south-west of Paris, Europe has not always brought the best.
Jordan Spieth, winner for three times of the main male tournaments, and Justin Thomas defined the reference for Americans with two points on Saturday.
The duet won a brave 2&1 victory over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter from Spain, and later returned to win Poulter and Rory McIllroy for 4&3 in the forsoms, having lost the two opening holes.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cup a team reversed a four-point disadvantage before the singles, although the team of Furyk, holder of the title, only needs to tie to keep the trophy.
After two days in the second position, a counter-attack on Sunday seems beyond its possibilities.
North Korea says "not to think" of unilateral disarmament without confidence
The Foreign Minister of North Korea said to the United Nations on Saturday that the continuation of the sanctions was aggravating the mistrust of the United States and that there was no way for the country to unilaterally dispense with its nuclear weapons under these circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the world body that North Korea had taken "significant measures of goodwill" last year, such as the interruption of nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of the nuclear testing centre and the commitment to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technologies.
"However, we don't see any corresponding US response," he said.
"Without confidence in the US there will be no confidence in our national security and in such circumstances there is no way to proceed to our disarmament first."
Although Ri has recycled well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to denuclearization, in which North Korea would be rewarded as he took graduate steps, his statements appear to be significant as they do not reject unilateral denuclearization in contrast with Pyongyang's previous positions.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit ever held between a US president in exercise and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim undertook to work towards "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump offered security assurances to North Korea.
North Korea has sought to achieve a formal end to the war in Korea from 1950 to 53, but the United States claims that Pyongyang has first to abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to soften the harsh international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on "denuclearization first" and increases the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive way, opposing itself until the "declaration of the end of the war"," said Ri.
"The perception that sanctions can put us on our knees is an impossible dream of people who know nothing about us.
However, the problem is that the extension of sanctions is aggravating our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that had been referred by the US leader in the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months, adding: "If the part concerned on this issue were South Korea and not the USA, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this impasse".
Still, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from that of last year, when he said to the UN General Assembly that guiding the rockets of North Korea towards the territory of the United States was inevitable after "Mr. President Mau" Trump called Kim "the rocket man" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who last year had threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, filled Kim with praise for his courage to take steps towards disarmament, but said that much was still to be done and that the sanctions would have to continue until the denuclearization of North Korea.
On Wednesday, Trump stated that he did not have a calendar to do so, stating that "if it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter".
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council must reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The implementation of the Security Council's sanctions must continue vigorously until the denuclearization is complete, final and verifiable".
The Security Council unanimously strengthened the sanctions against North Korea imposed since 2006 in an attempt to strangle the financing of North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri outside the UN General Assembly and declared after he would visit Pyongyang again in the month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, although then North Korea denounced him for "making demands of gangsters.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile facility and also a nuclear complex if the United States "took corresponding measures".
Pompeo said that Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" they were seeking were Trump's security assurances in Singapore, as well as initiatives to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend courses that teach them to rest enough
A new course at Harvard University this year put all its students to more sleep, an initiative to fight the Machist culture of studying in "directes" impregnated with caffeine.
One teacher concluded that students from this university at the top of the world ranking often had not the slightest idea about the most basic concepts of care they should have with themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, was the author of the course, who believes to be the first of his kind in the United States.
The inspiration for the course emerged after giving a talk about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"In the end, a girl came to me and said, "Why are you just telling me this in the last year of the course?"
The young woman said that no one had ever mentioned to her the importance of sleep, which surprised me," she told The Telegraph.
The course, taught for the first time this year, explains to students the essential concepts of how good sleep habits contribute positively to academic and athletic performance, as well as to the improvement of general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of University Health Services, stated that the institution decided to introduce the course after concluding that some students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a dorm where students click on coffee mugs, curtains, slippers and books to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light, and on how athletic performance is influenced by sleep deficiency, and the importance of a routine to pick up the bed.
In another section participants are informed how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of stroke, depression and cancer.
Then, a map of the campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
"We know that it will not change the behavior of students instantly.
However, we believe that they have the right to know, just as we all have the right to know the health effects of the option to smoke," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in "making direct" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students makes this a growing problem.
To ensure that we sleep well enough and with quality should be a "secret weapon" of the students to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, and even to avoid getting fat, because sleep deprivation puts the brain in hunger mode, making them constantly starving.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student of physical and chemical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes last year at Harvard.
The course opened his eyes and inspired him to encourage the creation of a course for the entire campus, he said.
The next step, according to their expectations, is to ask all graduate students who frequent a similar study program before entering the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students use an alarm for the time to go to bed, as well as to wake up, and that they are aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt the circadian rhythm and lead to trouble falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: golo de Menga overthrows Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another access to sadness out of the house when Dolly Menga's attack caused Steven Gerrard's broken team a 1-0 defeat at Livingston Stadium.
The team of Ibrax was trying to record his first victory in his race since the 1-0 win in February in St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team eventually inflicted on Gerard's second defeat in 18 games, leaving his team eight points behind the unbridled Hearts, leader of the first Scottish division.
Menga scored seven minutes before the end of the first part and the Rangers collective, uninspired, never seemed to be equal.
With Rangers now descending to the sixth position, Livingston goes up to the third, and only behind Hibernian for the difference of greed.
And even more problems may arise for Rangers after the prosecutor of Calum Spence line had received treatment of a head injury caused by a seemingly shot object in the visitor's area.
Gerrard made eight changes on the team that passed the Ayr in the mid-finals of Betfred Cup.
Holt, on his side, used the same eleven of Livingston who stole a spot from Hearts last week, and would have been delighted with the way his well-golded team suffocated the opponents on each play.
Rangers may have mastered the possession of a ball, but Livingston did more with the one he had.
The team could have scored immediately at two minutes, when the first pass sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's beacon, but the average wasted his big chance out.
A long free kick from Keaghan Jacobs went to meet Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow was able only to finish out towards the second track.
Rangers managed to regain control, but hope was greater than belief in the game at the end of the third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought he should have been granted a great penalty to the quarter hour with his collision with Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thomson refused Colombian appeals.
Rangers achieved only two endings at the first part, but the former warden of Iberox Liam Kelly had little to worry about the end of Lassana Coulibaly's head and the weak end of Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingston's goal at 34 minutes may have been contrary to what was expected of the game's development, it is undeniable that the team deserved it, even if it is not due to its tenacity.
Again, Rangers couldn't handle a long-standing Jacobs ball game.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher made a pass for Scott Robinson, who remained calm when he chose Menga for a simple completion.
Gerrard moved in the interval, having replaced Coulibaly by Ryan Kent, and this exchange almost had an immediate impact when the side advance passed to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly made a sprint from his line to make the blockade.
However, Livingston continued to force visitors to play exactly the type of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett making a long pass behind a long pass.
Holt's team may have increased its advantage in the final stages, but McGregor stood up well, defending himself from Jacobs before Lithgow finished out in the corner.
Rangers' replacement, Glenn Middleton, once again claimed a great penalty when he got angry in Jacobs, but Thomson ignored the request once again.
Almanac: the inventor of the counter Geiger
And now a page from our Almanaque "Sunday Morning": On September 30, 1882, it is today 136 years old and continues to CONTAR ... the physical future Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as Geiger counter.
The fundamental piece of science since then, the counter Geiger has also become a central element of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" in which the improbable cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans participated:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals as a uranium.

New cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to "see" harmful cells
A new cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to "see" harmful cells and to kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and its alteration in the laboratory
These cells, which can "see" a protein common to many cancers, are then injected back into the body
An experimental vaccine is producing promising results in patients with a series of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells, saw her cancer in the ovaries disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and its alteration in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to many cancers, designated by HER2. These cells are then injected again into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "controls the growth of various types of cancer", including breasts, ovaries, lungs, and colorectals, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to that involving removing immune cells from patients and "teaching" them to attack cancer cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarks on a Trump-supported diatribe by filling up a MAGA hat after its appearance in the SNL.
It didn't work out.
Kanye West went to the studio at the Saturday Night Live after an incoherent performance in which he praised the President of the United States, Donald Trump, claiming that he would apply for the presidential elections in 2020.
After performing his evening song, with the name Ghost Town, in which he wore a "Make America Great" hat, he began a brave fight against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"So many times I talk to a white guy and he tells me, "How can you like Trump? He's racist!"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I'd have left America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL began with a satire with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star trotted Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee on the allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it had not been transmitted, the scene of the West bravery was published on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to mess up West when he did.
In addition, West had complained to the public that he had spent a bad time in the backseat because of the hat.
"I was intimidated in the backseats.
They said, "Don't go there with that hat."
They intimidated me!
And then tell me I'm marginalized," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see marginalization?", saying that "I would put on my superman layer, because that means no one tells me what to do. Do you want the world to go ahead?
Try love."
His comments led to public vassation and the participants in the SNL appeared to be ashamed, he told Variety, having someone from the program told the newspaper: "The entire studio was completely silent".
West had been invited to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West has confused many with the performance of Perrier's I Love it bottle-dressed song.
West received a demonstration of support from the director of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who published the tweet: "To one of our bravest spirits: BROKEN BY ENFRENTANTS THE TURBA".
However, the interviewer Karen Hunter published a tweet saying that West was simply "what it is, and that's absolutely wonderful."
"But I chose NOT to reward someone (buying his music or supporting his "art") who I believe to be welcoming and propagating harmful ideologies to the community.
He's free.
And we too," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, claiming that it was now "the being formerly known by Kanye West".
West is not the first artist to change his name, following the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper Snoop Dogg has already used the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the missing Prince musical legend changed the name to a symbol and then to "the artist formerly known as Prince".
Accusing attempted murder after being stabbed in a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in the eastern Belfast area on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhacklove, said the police.
The defendant is expected to be presented to the Belfast Court on Monday.
The accusations will be analysed by the public ministry.
Throne War Star Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as a sgrimist as Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series of HBO, Throne War.
However, the actor, 31 years old, attacked the stereotype of the Machist hero, claiming that such roles on the screen make boys feel often that they have to be hard to be respected.
In a conversation with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that "something went wrong" and wondered about how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his colleague in the Rose Leslie Throne War, also 31 years old, admitted that he has a "very strong position" on the approach to the problem.
"I have a pretty strong personal position right now: what went wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What have we been teaching men when they're growing up in terms of the problem we're seeing now?"
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters.
And he went on, "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and on the streets that makes young people feel that they must belong to this particular form of masculinity?
I believe this is one of the big issues of our time: how can we change that?
Because clearly something went very wrong for young people."
In the interview, the actor also admitted that he would not enter any prequels or sequels of the Throne War when the series ends in the next summer, referring to that, for him, the "fields of battle and the horses" ended.
As of November, Kit will participate in a True West edition of Sam Shepard, which is the story of a movie producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he considers finding his wife Rose was the best thing that came out of the Throne War.
"I met my wife in this series, so somehow she gave me my future family and my life from here on," she said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the loving interest of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the fantasy series awarded to Emmys.
The couple took the lead in June 2018 on the grounds of Leslie's family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% leap in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, health authorities said.
Some 40 000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases result from transmissions through sexual relations, which marks a change in relation to the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV in this way was reduced to almost zero, said the Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, in terms of annual homologous variation, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100 000 people.
The transmission of HIV through sexual relations is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but it is said that discrimination against the LGBT community is frequent.
Studies have estimated that, due to conservative values in the country, 70 to 90% of men who had sexual intercourse with other men end up marrying women.
Many transmissions of diseases are derived from inappropriate sexual protections in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters dispels information leaking about Republican senators by one of his collaborators and attacks "dangerous liars" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Congressman Maxine Waters denied on Saturday the allegations that a member of your team would have published personal information from three U.S. Senate members on the Wikipedia pages of legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrat stated that the accusations were being promoted by opinion leaders and websites of the "ultra-right".
"Taxes, lies and more despicable lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information allegedly includes the homes of the homes and telephone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person in Capitol Hill during a hearing with a Senate panel on allegations of improper sexual conduct against Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court.
The information leak occurred some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the publications was associated with the Waters office and published the data of a Waters staff member, reported The Hill.
"This baseless accusation is totally false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"My collaborator, whose identity, personal data and security were compromised by these fraudulent and false allegations, had no responsibility for this leak of information.
This baseless accusation is totally false and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly attracted online criticism, including those of the former press secretary of the White House Ari Fleischer.
"This lie is choleric," Fleischer wrote.
"It suggests that she does not have the temper to be a Congressman.
When someone's accused of something that's not his responsibility, he can't get angry.
You can't have a challenging posture.
You can't question the defendant's motives.
It has to reveal calmness and serenity."
Fleischer seemed to compare the Waters reaction with the criticism of the Democrats to Judge Kavanaugh, who had been accused by critics of appearing to be too angry during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who will play the Waters place in the mid-term elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Very bad if it's true," she reads on her tweet.
In his statement, Waters stated that his office had alerted "the competent authorities" to these fraudulent allegations.
"We ensure that the guilty will be revealed," he continued, "and will be legally held responsible for all his acts, which are destructive and dangerous to all and any members of my staff."
Johnny's Criticism English Back to Attack - weak spy movie parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now fashion to search for connotations with Brexit in any new film with a British taste, and this seems to apply in fact to the new edition in the series of comedy films and action Johnny English, started in 2003 with "Johnny English" and brought back to life in 2011 with "The Return of Johnny English".
Is the ironic satire on the subject of being so bad the new opportunity for export to the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his eyes embroidered and an excessively elastic expression obtained his license to create the confusion, renewed a second time - with his name signaling, more than anything else, that it is a comprehensive comic creation destined for non-anglophone cynephiles.
He is, of course, the stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims to a soft glamorous, has a little Cloiseau, a bit of Mr. Bean and something of that guy who contributed with a single note to the theme of the movie "Moments of Glory" at the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony.
In addition, his character was originally based on the international mysterious traveler and man whose role Atkinson played in the TV ads for Barclaycard, who left chaos in his tracks.
There are one or two interesting moments in this latest edition of JE.
I loved the scene in which Johnny English approaches a helicopter by clogging a medieval armor, with the rotor’s shovels making a short noise of carriage against the helmet.
The Atkinson talent for comedy is obvious, but humor sounds weak and strangely superfluous, especially considering that the editions of "serious" films such as the 007 and the Impossible Missions now confidently propose comedy as an ingredient.
We have the idea that humor is aimed at children and not adults and, in my opinion, Johnny English's bizarre adventures are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent movie numbers in Bean's character.
Now, the premise, always current, is that Britain is in a serious mess.
A computer pirate infiltrated the British super-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground to dismay the service agent, a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last drop for a prime minister who incarnates a pompous and conflicting figure, to suffer already a total discalation of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives his best with this role that reminds of the character of Theresa May, but the argument does not give much material for great flights.
Your Secret Service Advisors inform you that, since all agents in the asset have become engaged, you will have to get someone out of reform.
And this person is the disgraced Johnny English, now working as a teacher in a chic school, but giving non-official classes on how to be an infiltrated spy: here are some interesting numbers, because English offers us a spy academy in the style of the movie "Rock School".
English is quickly taken to Whitehall to receive emergency instructions and join again to his suffering assistant Bough, a role played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, tied to a submarine commander, an exhilarating character in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
Thus, the Batman and Robin of the catastrophe at the Secret Service of His Majesty are back in action, facing the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is being dangerously fascinated by the charismatic billionaire of technologies that claim to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of absurd acts cast off: disguised as table employees, they lit up a beautiful French restaurant, create the confusion penetrating as clandestine in the luxurious yacht of Volta, and English triggers pure anarchy how much he tries to use virtual reality glasses to get acquainted with the interior of the house of Volta.
All the stops were certainly created in view of this last sequence, but for the most nice and stormy it is, the set has plenty of TV for children.
The result is quite median.
And as in Johnny English's other films, I couldn't stop wondering: wouldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that does justice to his talent?
Workers deny that they are generating a plan for the British to work four days a week, but receiving five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party may be considering a radical plan to provide the British with a four-day work week, but with five paid days.
Reports suggest that the party wants the bosses to pass on the savings with the artificial intelligence revolution (IA) to the workers, granting them an additional day of strike.
The workers would get a three-day weekend, but keeping the order.
Sources report that the idea of "adjusting" to the economic programme of the party, which reorientes the country in favour of workers.
The shift to a four-day work week obtained the favorable opinion of the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to take advantage of the changes in the economy.
A senior Labour Party leader said to The Sunday Times: "We hope to announce a policy review before the end of the year.
"It won't happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is an aspiration adjusted to the party's approach to the balance of the economy for the worker, as well as the overall strategy of the party for the industrial sector."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, since the Green Party had already proposed a working week of four days during its campaign for the 2017 legislative elections.
However, this aspiration is currently not favored by the entire Labour Party.
One party spokesman said, "The four-day workweek is not part of the party's policy and we are not considering it."
The shadow finance minister John McDonnell used the party conference last week to reveal his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell stated that he was determined to regain the power of the hands of "faceless directors" and "speculators" of basic service companies.
Its plans also include the non-recovery of the total share of current shareholders of water companies, since the Labour Party may make "deductions" on the basis of the perception of unlawful conduct.
McDonnell has also confirmed plans to place workers in the company's management boards and create Inclusive ownership funds that transfer 10% of the share of private companies to employees, which may charge dividends that can be raised to 500 pounds annually.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" if the FBI investigation can do them or not change their mind
The FBI's investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote of its appointment to the Supreme Court for at least one week, raising questions as to whether the conclusions could lead Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview to be broadcast on Sunday, the correspondent for the "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could figure out something to change their mind.
Kennedy proved to be more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said when I went to the audience, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I phoned him after this happened, when this allegation appeared, and I asked him, "Did you do it"?
He was resolved, determined, unequivocal."
Graham's vote, however, seems unmovable.
"I am determined about Brett Kavanaugh and an explosive charge would be required," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett made a strong lie," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all she mentioned failed to confirm it.
It was 36 years ago.
I see nothing new changing."
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Did something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York City will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event with an extremely impressive list of stars that will act on an equally impressive mission: to eradicate poverty in the world.
By the seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will host tens of thousands of people in the Grand Grass of Central Park, not only to watch acts like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to increase awareness of the real objective of the event: to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, started in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a defense group that hopes to put an end to poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight it.
To receive a free ticket for the event (unless they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket) spectators had to perform a series of tasks, or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a world leader, a phone call or any other significant forms that contribute to increasing awareness of the goal of ending poverty.
However, what was the degree of success of Global Citizen in these 12 years in achieving its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a genuine way to persuade them to demand action, or this is just another case of "clicactivism" - do we think it makes any difference to sign an online petition or send a tweet?
Global Citizen states that since 2011, it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters who have exerted pressure to achieve a number of different objectives.
These actions, according to the organization, contributed to the announcement by world leaders of commitments and policies valued at more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and announcements arising from their actions, with at least $10 billion in respect of them being already disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that the funds obtained have so far had a direct impact on almost 649 million people scattered around the world.
Some of the main commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership based in the United Kingdom, bringing together investors and developers committed to "help children achieve their full potential", which promised to give Rwanda $35 million to help end undernutrition in the country. This after having received more than 4700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like all of us, we can make the social injustice of undernutrition a footnote to History," said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, a crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that, after more than 5000 pressure actions on the United Kingdom to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced that it would finance a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will cover 5 million women and children, with interventions at the level of nutrition.
In response to one of the frequent questions on the website, "What makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen answers: "It has been a long and tortuous way - sometimes we have fallen and failed.
But, like the great movements for civil and anti-apartheid rights that preceded us, because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are among the artists who will perform this year's event in New York, presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US can use the Navy as a "block" to put a barrier to Russia's energy exports - Secretary of the Interior
"If necessary," Washington may use its Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, revealed US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke, Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria, in particular where the legitimate government is invited, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to intermitte energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, in the southern belly of Europe," he said.
And according to the ruler, there are ways and means to prevent it.
"The United States has the capacity, with its navy, to ensure that the sea routes are open and, if necessary, to block to ensure that energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants in an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group entitled "the voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
In his speech, he continued to compare Washington's approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, stating that they are effectively the same.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia is, more or less, to leverage and replace fuels," he said, while referring to Russia as a "magic of a single trick" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements arise at a time when the Trump administration is on a mission to increase natural gas exports to Europe, instead of Russia, which is the cheapest far option for European consumers.
To this end, the Trump administration authorities, including the president himself, try to persuade Germany to abandon the "unfair" Nord Stream pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stated that the pipeline Nord Stream, budgeted at $11 billion, aims to double the existing capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's fervent opposition to the project is merely motivated for economic reasons, and this is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument for exerting pressure and that consumers must have the ability to choose suppliers," said Russia's Minister for Energy Aleksandr Novak following a meeting with the US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position prompted a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main German industrial association, the German Industry Federation (BDI), called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, chief executive of the German Industry Federation (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "will deeply analyze" the possibility of applying for the presidency in 2020," said Senator of Massachusetts
Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he "will deeply analyze" the possibility of applying for the presidency following the mid-term elections.
During an informal public debate in Holyoke in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider applying.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington to repair our dysfunctional government, and that includes a woman as the ultimate manager," said The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will deeply examine the possibility of applying for the presidency."
Warren commented on President Donald Trump during the informal debate, stating that "he was taking the country in the wrong direction."
"I am extremely concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren has been a tough vocal critic of Trump and his name to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said that "of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a survey carried out on Thursday revealed that the majority of Warren's own constituents are not of the opinion that she should apply for the presidency in 2020.
59% of Massachusetts' "provable" voters stated that the senator should not apply, according to the survey of the political research center of the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe.
32% support your application.
The survey showed superior support for a candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% in favor of potential candidacy and 48% against.
Other prominent names of the Democratic Party debated on a potential candidacy in 2020 include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide officially in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentioned the post-traumatic stress of Track Palin at a start by Donald Trump
Track Palin, aged 26, spent a year in Iraq after his enlistment in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and accused of an incident of domestic violence
"What my own son is going through, what's going on after he's back, I can identify with the other families who feel the ramifications of post-traumatic stress and some of the wounds with which our soldiers, in fact, come back," he told the audience of a commission in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called this detention "the elephant in the room" and said that his son and other veterans "return a little bit different, they return hardened, they again wonder if there is such respect for what their comrade soldiers and aviators, and all the other members of the armed forces, gave the country."
Track Palin was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence over a woman and possession of a weapon while alcoholized, according to Dan Bennett, spokesperson of the Wasilla Police Department.
Eighteen states and the District of Colombia support the challenge of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Colombia are supporting a legal challenge to a new US policy that refuses asylum to victims of gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district sent a friendly statement curiae (court friends) on Friday in Washington, in support of an asylum seeker who is contesting this policy, referred to NBC News.
The full name of the complainant in Grace vs. Sessions that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against politics was not revealed.
The person said that his partner "and his children, members of a violent gang," abused her, but the US authorities rejected his asylum application on July 20.
The complainant was arrested in Texas.
Public ministries supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum candidates in the United States, as nations facing widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy revoked a 2014 decision of the Immigrant Resources Council that allowed immigrants without documents fleeing from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The District Attorney General Karl Racine stated, in a statement on Friday, that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international laws".
"Federal legislation requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of specific facts and circumstances underlying them; this prohibition violates that principle", is read in the statement amicus curiae.
The lawyers also argued in that statement that the police ban on the entry of immigrants negatively affects the US economy, stating that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "available the necessary labour force".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gangs in June.
"A asylum is available to those who leave their country due to persecution or fears on the basis of ethnicity, religion, nationality or belonging to a specific social group or with a certain political opinion," said Sessions in their announcement of politics on June 11.
Asylum has never been destined to alleviate all the problems, not even all the serious problems, that people face every day throughout the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu when the number of deaths doubles in a counter-clock to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is increasingly desperate.
"The environment is very tense," said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, mother of a male febrile baby, comforting him in a evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute, an ambulance brings more bodies.
There is a shortage of clean water."
Residents were warned that they would return to their destroyed homes to try to save all they could find among their waterborne belongings.
There were hundreds of wounded and the hospitals, damaged by magnitude 7.5 earthquake, were overloaded.
Some of the wounded, such as Dwi Haris, who fractured the ribs and shoulder, rested outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated abroad due to the strong replicas they continued.
His eyes were bathed in tears when he reported how he felt when the violent earthquake shook him in the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I got stuck in the ruins of the wall, I believe," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife scream for help, but then, quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of "intimidation" with "advertising ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a US daily newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to China Daily's paid supplement at Des Moines Register, the most-trigger newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 elections for the Congress, an accusation denied by China.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US elections marked the beginning of what American authorities, in statements to Reuters, designated as a new phase in the growing Washington campaign to pressure China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in the midst of an ever-increasing trade war that saw both sides apply tariff vacancies on the other's imports.
China's retaliation tariffs in the early stages of the commercial war were designed to affect exporters in states that support the Trump Republican Party, say Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former long-standing governor of Iowa, a large exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing has harmed workers, farmers and American companies.
In China, Branstad wrote in an opinion article at the Des Moines Register on Sunday, "it is now putting its foot on the accelerator of this intimidation with the publication of propaganda advertisements in our free press."
"With the dissemination of this propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the cherished American tradition of freedom of expression and press by publishing an ad paid at Des Moines Register," Branstad said.
"On the other hand, at the banks here in Beijing, we find very few dissenting voices and we will never see a real reflection of the disparity of views that the Chinese may have of the worrying economic trajectory of their country, because the media are under the firm control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
Moreover, he added that "one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers refused the offer to publish" his article, although he did not mention what.
Republicans alienate female voters before mid-term elections with the Kavanaugh disaster, warn analysts
At a time when many important Republicans support and defend the nominee for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh in the face of the various allegations of sexual assault, analysts say that this may provoke a negative reaction, particularly from women, during the interim elections to take place shortly.
The emotions around the case have been very strong and most Republicans have already publicly stated that they want to move forward to a vote.
These things have no backlog," said The Hill Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher stated that he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake (Republican Arizona)'s last-minute pressure to conduct an FBI investigation is enough to appease the angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow or in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokesperson of the progressive movement on Friday, according to Washington newspaper D.C.
On Friday morning, Protestants sang "November is at the door!" when they manifested themselves at the Senate court, as the Republicans who control the Judicial Committee chose to advance with the appointment of Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported the Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will beat all the memories," said Stu Rothenberg, a political analyst without party affiliation.
"People say it's already high; it's true.
But it can be even higher, particularly among undecided voters in suburban areas and younger voters, from 18 to 29 years old, who, although they do not like the president, often do not vote".
Even before Ford's public testimony describing his allegations of sexual assault against him appointed to the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that a negative reaction could occur if Republicans moved forward with confirmation.
"This became a sham for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former president of the National Republican Committee at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee's vote, or about whether Kavanaugh will take his seat as a judge. It's also about how the Republicans dealt with the matter and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of the US Priority, a group that helps to elect democrats, to the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be something divided about who to believe after the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a small majority aligning with the first.
A new survey by YouGov revealed that 41% of respondents believed absolute or probably in Ford's testimony, while 35% said they believed absolute or probably in Kavanaugh.
Moreover, 38% claimed that they considered Kavanaugh likely or absolutely lied in their testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
After Flake's proposal, the FBI started an investigation into Ford's allegations, as well as another defendant, Deborah Ramirez, according to the Guardian.
Ford swore before the Senate Judicial Committee last week that Kavanaugh had sexually harassed her while she was drunk when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the nominee for the Supreme Court exposed his genital organs when they both participated in a party during the period when they both studied in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web intends to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, created a startup that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this legendary technology character, Inrupt, is a company that takes advantage of the open source platform of Berners-Lee, Solid.
This allows users to decide where their data is stored and who has access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee judiciously stated that the intention behind Inrupt is to "dominate the world".
"We have to do it now," he said regarding the startup.
"It's an historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data storage", or POD.
This can contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available in a single browser and at the same time.
What is unique about the personal online data storage is that it is up only for the user to decide who has access to what type of information.
The company calls it "personal capacity through data".
Inrupt's idea, according to CEO John Bruce, is to provide adequate resources, processes and skills to help make Solid available to all.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some internal programmers hired to work on the project and a community of programmers on volunteering.
Starting this week, technology creators scattered around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about the introduction or not of a total change in which all his business models are turned from bird to bird one day.
"We're not asking for permission."
In a publication on the Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to create commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new Web created with Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when it created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on Internet neutrality.
Even as he launches Inruptt, Berners-Lee will continue to be founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this next era of the Web," said Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: tribute to the clergy decorated with Victoria Cross in the First Great War
The only clergy from the Church of England to receive Victoria Cross during the First Great War as a fighter was honored in her nation-town over 100 years.
Lieutenant-Coronel Reverend Bernard Vann obtained the decoration on September 29, 1918 with the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew that he received the highest British military honour.
His two grandsons dropped a memorial plaque at a stop in Rushden in Northamptonshire on Saturday.
One of them, Michael Vann, said it was "brightly symbolic" that the plaque had been presented exactly 100 years after the fact that it gave the decoration to his grandfather.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Coronel Vann led his battalion in the Saint-Quentin Canal crossing "in a very thick fog and under closed fire of portable weapons and machine guns".
Then he ran to the line of fire and, "with the greatest courage," led the line forward before attacking alone a cannon and shooting three soldiers from the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I would never equal, but also a lesson in humility."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, deposited a crown of flowers after the stop, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he "felt very honored to participate in the stop" and added that "the courage of a genuine hero is being demonstrated through the support that will be given by many people."
Fans of mixed martial arts all night to see the Bellator 206 attend instead to Porca Peppa
Imagine this: you stay awake all night to see the Bellator 206, full of stars and, in the end, you are prevented from seeing the main event.
The San José series included 13 combats, with six of the main group, and was being displayed live during the night in the United Kingdom, in Channel 5.
At six in the morning, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the confrontation, the spectators in the United Kingdom were amazed when the coverage changed to Porca Peppa.
Some did not impress themselves after they had been awake until early in the morning especially for combat.
A fan on Twitter described the change to cartoons for children as "a kind of joke of bad taste".
"The government's regulation says that the content is not suitable for six in the morning, so they had to change to another programming," said Dave Schwartz, administrator with marketing and communications plow, when asked about the transmission.
"Groan Peppa," yes.
The president of the Bellator Company, Scott Coker, said that it would correct the transmission calendar to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think, when I think about the repetition, I think we can solve the problem," said Coker.
"But it's Sunday morning six there and we won't be able to solve it until our Sunday hour, which is Monday at British time.
But we're working on it.
I'm not lying when I say that when programming changed, there were many messages exchanged and none very nice.
We were trying to solve the problem, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But it was not: it was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen next time.
We will reduce the number of fights to five instead of six, as we normally do, and we have tried to exceed the expectations of the fans and we have exaggerated.
It's a pitiful situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "lower" about his sexuality
The Olympic diver Tom Daley said he grew to feel inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but that gave him motivation to become a success.
The 24-year-old athlete said he didn't realize until he went into high school that "not everyone is like me."
In an interview with the first Desert Island Discs from Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he expressed his support for homosexual rights to give others "hope".
He also stated that becoming a father made him worry less about winning the Olympic Games.
The long-standing regular presenter of the program, Kirsty Young, took off several months as a result of disease.
Appearing as a pair in Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt " inferior" to all the others because "it was socially unacceptable to like boys and girls."
In his words, "to this day, this impression of feeling smaller and different has been the real reason that has given me the power and the strength to achieve success."
His goal was to prove that he was "someone," he said, not to disappoint everyone when they discovered their sexuality sooner or later.
The double Olympic bronze medalist became a prominent LGBT activist and used his participation in the Commonwealth Games this year in Australia to appeal to more countries to describe homosexuality.
According to him, he manifested himself because he felt happy that he could live openly without consequences and intended to give "hope" to others.
The world trichamp said that to fall in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, "I was surprised."
Daley got married last year with Oscar's winner, 20 years older, although he said that the age difference was never a problem.
"When we pass so when we are so young" - his first participation in the Olympics was at 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later - he said, it is difficult to find someone of the same age who has gone through similar heights and basses.
The couple had a son last June, named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that "all his perspective" had changed.
"If they had asked me last year, all it mattered was "to win a gold medal," he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
Your son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at 40 years of age after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept the fact that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was whether they already had tickets for the games in London in 2012, because he wanted to be on the front line.
"I couldn't tell you you're not gonna be here to be in the front row, Dad," he said.
"I was holding him not hand when he stopped breathing and it was only when he really stopped breathing and died that I finally recognized that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I was fully aware that it was what I had dreamed of the whole life: diving in front of a multitude of compatriots in the Olympic Games...there was no better feeling," he said.
All of this was also the inspiration of his first choice of song - Proud, by Heather Small - with which he had identified himself during the preparation for the Olympics, and which still gives him chicken skin.
Desert Island Discs goes to BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 a.m., British summer time.
Mickelson in the shape of the bank at Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will reach a record on Saturday when he plays his 47th match on a Ryder Cup, but he will have to recover his way to prevent the mark from symbolizing an unfortunate occasion.
Mickelson, playing in the biennial event for the 12th time, a record of participations, was sent to the bank by Captain Jim Furyk in the fourballs and forsomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the centre of the action, as has often been on the teams of the United States, the five-time winner of the main male championships divided the day between the supporter function and the work in their field game, in the hope of correcting what afflicts him.
The 48-year-old player is not the ideal player for the Le Golf Nacional field, where the long-term rough usually punishes errant strokes.
And if the field alone wasn't intimidating enough, Mickelson, on Sunday's 9th, will face the precise British Open Francesco Molinari champion, who teamed up with beginner Tommy Fleetwood, winning all four matches for them this week.
If Americans, with a four-point disadvantage to start the 12 single matches, record a good start, Mickelson's departure can be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, but not that he could say much more.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a slap in the back, put his arm around me and said I would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He has great confidence in himself.
He's a respected champion who gave a lot to these teams in the past, and also this week.
I probably hadn't seen him play two games.
I thought more, but that's how it happened, and that's how we thought we'd have to go on.
He wants to be in the game, like everyone else."
Mickelson will exceed Nick Faldo's record on Sunday of the largest number of games played at Ryder Cup.
This may mark the end of a career in Ryder Cup that has never equaled the successes of your individual curriculum.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven draws, although Furyk has claimed that his presence has created some intangible advantages for the team.
"He's sarcastic, funny and spiritual, he likes to play with people and he's an excellent person to have in the team room," he said.
"I think the younger players had fun getting in on it too this week, which was fun to see.
He gives a lot more than just to play."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that his great advantage can disappear on an apex
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, knows from experience that his outspoken leadership when entering the last singles day in Ryder Cup can easily become an accidental ride.
The Danish had its debut in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team headed by Seve Ballesteros maintained a five-point advantage over the Americans, but crossed the line of the goal with the narrowest nose of the margins, winning for 1411⁄2-131⁄2.
"We always try to remember that we had a considerable advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but little by little," Bjorn said, in the image, after having attended the victory of the 2018 Turma by 5-3, both on Friday and yesterday, to lead 10-5 at Le Golf National.
So history has shown me and everyone on this team that this isn't over yet.
Tomorrow, give your best.
Go over there and do everything right.
This does not end until we have the points on the marker.
We have a goal that is to try to win this trophy and that is where the focus should remain.
I have always said that I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we are well aware of who is on the other side: the best players in the world."
Enchanted with the performance of their players in a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never get ahead of it myself.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
Tomorrow what matters are individual performances and this involves a different task.
It's great to be there with a partner when things go well, but when we're there on our own, our skills as golfers are tested to the best.
This is the message that you need to convey to the players: tomorrow, give your best.
Now they're leaving the partner and he has to go and give the best of himself as well."
In contrast to Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will seek to ensure that their players have a better performance individually than as partners, constituting the exceptions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points in four.
Furyk himself was already on both sides of these great rounds on the last day, having been part of the winning team in Brookline before finally losing when Europe pulled out of the card the "Milagre in Medina".
"I remember all the words," he said in answer to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, motivated his players for the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you would like to get that quick start as you saw in Brookline and what you saw in Medina.
When this impulse turns to one side, the pressure is very large in these middle departures.
We have organized our effectiveness accordingly and ordered players the way we feel, you know, that we will try to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas, with the task of trying to lead the counter-attack, faces Rory McIllroy in the main match, being Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the first half of the ordering.
"I chose this group of players for this order because I believe it covers the entire route," Bjorn said about his choices for singles.
New German warship once again postponed
The most recent German Navy frigate should have entered service in 2014 to replace warships of the Cold War. However, it will be necessary to wait at least until next year, due to systems prone to failures and an exponential growth cost, according to local media.
The entrance to the service of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," the command ship of the new frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, was now postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit quoting a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the disturbing post-delivery problems undermine the fate of the ambitious project.
The four boats of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class which the Navy had ordered in 2007 will serve to replace the aged frigates of the Bremen class.
It is known that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, as well as a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some furtive technologies such as the reduction of radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer periods between maintenances, which would allow the most recent frigates to be sent to missions with a maximum duration of two years away from the ports of origin.
However, the continuing delays have made it possible for state-of-the-art warships, considered as a way for Germany to project foreign-border power, to be outdated when they enter into service, says Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German navy refused to put it in service, having returned it to the shipyards of Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media cite a series of crucial "hardware and software defects" that would make the warship useless if used in a combat mission.
The shortcomings of the software were particularly important, since the Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessels will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, only half of the quota needed in the oldest Fragates of the Bremen class.
It was also known that the vessel is excessively heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the marine's ability to install additional features in the future.
It is believed that the "Rheinland-Pfalz" of 7000 tons has twice the weight of similar class ships used by Germans in World War II.
In addition to hardware failures, the cost of the whole project, including crew training, is also becoming a problem.
It is said that this has reached some astonishing EUR 3.1 billion, an increase compared to the initially budgeted EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems experienced by the most recent frigates have become particularly important in the light of recent warnings that German naval power is weakening.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, leader of the German Defence Parliamentary Committee, recognized that the Navy is currently running out of ships capable of being used."
The politician said that the problem grew exponentially over time, as older ships were put out of service without any boats to replace them.
In the end, he regretted that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class had been able to join the Navy.
National Trust spies on the secret life of bats
New investigations are being carried out on a property in the Scottish Highlands with the aim of revealing how bats use the landscape to search for food.
It is expected that the results will shed some light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide conservation activities in the future.
The study, carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will follow common and fruit bats as well as long ears browns and Daubenton bats in the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations scattered by the property to follow the activities of the bats along the station.
Mobile studies will also be carried out by NTS staff and volunteers with portable detectors.
The analysis by specialists of all recordings will evaluate the frequency of the call of bats and what each species is doing.
A habitat map will then be produced to create a detailed image of its territorial-scale behaviors.
Rob Dewar, an adviser for the conservation of the nature of the NTS, expects the results to reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows, as well as the best way to maintain forests for bats and associated species.
The populations of bats in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined considerably over the past century.
These animals are threatened by construction and development works that affect the dorms and make habitat scarce.
Wind turbines and lightnings are also a threat, together with the kill papers and some chemical treatments of building materials, in addition to the attacks of domestic cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, given your night hunting habits, your ears are more useful than your eyes when it comes to catching the prey.
It is by them used a sophisticated echo location technique to identify insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the region, takes the bats very seriously.
The organisation has ten trained specialists who regularly conduct studies, dormitory inspections and sometimes rescues.
He also created the first reserve in Scotland dedicated exclusively to bats, on the Three estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which houses eight of the ten species of Scottish bats.
The property manager, David Thompson, says that the same is the ideal territory for them.
"Here in Three we have an excellent area for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many veteran trees and all this good habitat.
However, there is still much about the bats we don't know, so the work we do here and in the other properties will help us know more about what they need to bloom."
It was emphasized by him the importance of checking whether there are bats before carrying out maintenance on the properties, because the unintentional destruction of only a maternity dorm can lead to the death of up to 400 females and young animals, which could eradicate the entire local population.
The bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill them, besiege them, disturb them or destroy their dorms.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish head of Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to participate to help.
It was by her saying: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of our species, we just don't know how their populations are vindicting."
Ronaldo refutes charges of rape when his lawyers prepare to prosecute German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo characterized the allegations of rape against him as "false news", stating that people "wanted to promote" using his name.
Your lawyers are preparing to process the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The advanced selection of Portuguese and Juventus was accused of violating an American woman, identified as Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is claimed that he will then pay 375 000 dollars for the alleged victim to remain silent about the accident, read on Friday's Der Spiegel.
Speaking in a live video on Instagram to its 142 million followers hours after the disclosure of the allegations, Ronaldo, 33 years old, characterized the reports as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," said the chamber winner of five Gold Balls.
"They want to promote themselves at the expense of my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but that's part of the profession.
I'm a happy man and it's all right," added the player with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel about the allegations, which have characterized as "an unacceptable report of suspicions in the area of privacy", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz stated that the player would demand compensation for moral damages in the amount corresponding to the seriousness of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident will take place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga will allegedly have gone to the player's room, where the player has violated her annually, in accordance with the documents submitted to Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that Ronaldo stood on his knees after the alleged incident and told him that it was "99%" "a good guy", impaired by "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sexual relations, but that it was consensual.
Majorga also claims that he addressed the police and had photographs of his injuries taken in a hospital, but that he would later agree to enter into an extra-judicial agreement because he felt "aterrorized by the prospect of retaliation" and be concerned about the possibility of "being publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman now claims that she intends to cancel the agreement because she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid, leaving Manchester United, at the time of the alleged aggression. This summer moved to the Italian giant Juve in a 100 million euro business.
Brexit: The United Kingdom "would spend forever" on losing car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would "repent forever" if it lost its status as a world leader in the car industry after Brexit, said the Secretary for Greg Clark's Enterprises.
Clark also said that Toyota in the UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without agreement, it would temporarily stop production of its factory in Burnaston near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer said that the impact of delays on borders in the case of a Brexit without agreement could lead to the loss of jobs.
The Burnaston factory, which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models, produced almost 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My vision is that, if Britain leaves the EU messy at the end of March, we will be watching production stops at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota Executive Director in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom expressed concerns about the EU's exit without agreement on the functioning of cross-border transactions, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said it would close its Minis factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what manufacturers claim to be the risks of the supply chain in the case of a Brexit without agreement.
Toyota's production line is managed on a "just-in-time" basis, with the parts reaching every 37 minutes, from suppliers in both the United Kingdom and the EU, for vehicles manufactured by order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without agreement on 29 March, disturbances may occur at the border, which the sector says can lead to delays and a shortage of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day of stocks in its Derbyshire factory, he said the company, so production would have to stop.
Clark stated that Theresa May's "Checkers Plan" for future relations with the EU was "calibrated precisely to avoid these border checks".
"We have to have an agreement, and we want to have the best agreement that will allow, as I said, not only the current success, but also the use by us of this opportunity," said BBC Radio 4 Today.
"The evidence not only of Toyota but also of other manufacturers points out that we absolutely need to be able to carry on with what has been a highly successful set of supply chains."
Although it could not provide an estimate of the stopping time, Toyota said that in the long run the increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and could lead, sooner or later, to the loss of jobs.
Peter Tsoovallaris, who worked at the Burnaston factory for 24 years and coordinated the United Union at this location, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "According to my experience, if they are lost, these jobs will never return.
A spokesperson for the government said that "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU".
Trump meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, says the White House
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "scheduled another week" since there is still no understanding about Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court, referred to the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of legal adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the elections, links between Trump's advisers and Russia and possible obstruction of justice by the President.
The fact that Trump may be preparing the Deputy Attorney General's dismissal, thus jeopardizing Mueller's independence, has been fueling rumors in Washington for months.
At the beginning of this month the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of secretly recording talks with Trump and the possibility of depositing the President through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last Monday he moved to the White House, with information that he would be about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump, who was in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said that "I'd rather not fire" Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed to avoid overlapping with a hearing of the Senate Justice Commission in which they witnessed Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI investigation for a week on charges against Kavanaugh, delaying the final vote in the Senate.
Trump's press advisor, Sarah Sanders, participated in Fox News Sunday.
Questioned about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "The date has not yet been marked, it may be this week, but it can also be postponed another week, given all that has happened in the Supreme Court.
Let's see, I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists would not agree with this statement: Sanders does not hold a press conference in the White House since September 10.
Mr. Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the shortage of press conferences is not due to an aversion to the "protagonism" of television reporters, although he said that: "I would not disagree with the fact that they like the protagonists."
He then realized that the direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The President makes more questions and answers than any previous president," he said, adding, without adding evidence, "We'll look at these numbers."
Press conferences will continue, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, that is infinitely better than talking to me.
We have tried to do this often and have seen that we have done it in the last few weeks, and the fact that they can talk to the President of the United States replaces any press conference."
Trump regularly responds to questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences when receiving foreign representatives.
The press conferences on the ground are rare.
This week the President showed why in New York, appearing casually and sometimes oddly before the journalists present.
Minister of Health writes to EU workers at the Scottish National Health Service about Brexit's fears
The Minister of Health wrote to EU staff working at the Scottish National Health Service to express the country's gratitude and request that they stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent the letter less than six months after leaving the United Kingdom of the EU.
The Scottish government has already undertaken to pay for applications for the status of residents of EU citizens working in the decentralized public services of the country.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "During the summer the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on withdrawal were continued, and decisions were expected for this fall.
But the UK government has also accelerated the preparations for a possible exit scenario without agreement.
I know this is a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reaffirm at this moment how much I value the contribution of each official, regardless of his or her nationality.
Members from across the EU and from other backgrounds bring valuable experience and skills, which strengthen and improve the work of the health service, benefiting the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is truly your home and we really want you to continue here."
Christion Abercrombie under emergency surgery after suffering head injuries
The defense of Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, was subjected to emergency surgery after suffering head injuries in the defeat of Saturday for 31-27 in front of the Vanderbilt Commodores, told Mike Organ, of the Tigers.
The coach of the Tennessee team, Rod Reed, told the journalists that the injury occurred shortly before the interval.
"He approached the side line and practically fainted," Reed said.
The technical team and medical personnel put Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before lying on a maca and transporting it to a deeper evaluation.
A team representative told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no information about the type/gravity of the injury" and that the team is trying to find out when this happened.
Abercrombie, a second-year student, suspended the studies during the first season with the Tennessee State Tigers after a transfer from Illinois.
He did five plaques on Saturday before leaving the game, which raises his total season to 18 plaques.
A higher stamp tax will be charged to foreign buyers when they acquire property in the United Kingdom
The Conservative Party announced plans to charge a higher stamp tax to foreign buyers who acquire properties in the United Kingdom, with the additional revenue to be invested in the aid to homeless persons
The measure will neutralize the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract the younger electorate
The rise in stamp tax will affect buyers who are not charged in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people
A higher stamp tax will be charged to foreign buyers who acquire property in the UK, with the additional revenue to be invested in the aid to homeless people, today will announce Theresa May.
The measure is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract the younger electorate, with promises to provide more affordable accommodation and tax higher incomes.
The rise in the stamp tax will affect people and businesses who are not charged in the UK, with the additional revenue to boost the government's campaign to offer shelter to homeless people.
The surcharge - added to the current stamp tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago for the second housing and rental purchases - may rise to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects that the measure will make it possible to raise up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13% of the new constructions in London are acquired by non-residents in the United Kingdom, raising prices and making it difficult for buyers to access the market.
Many prosperous areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of the time outside the country.
The new policy emerges weeks after Boris Johnson has demanded a stamp tax cut to help young people acquire their first home.
He accused the large construction companies of maintaining the prices of high properties when they land unused, demanding that Mrs May abandon the quotas on affordable housing to solve the "disgrace of housing" in Britain.
Mr Corbyn announced a joint appeal for housing reform proposals, including income controls and the end of the evictions "without justification".
It also wants to assign extended powers to municipalities for the construction of new houses.
Ms. May said: "Last year I stated that I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British dream that living conditions should be improved for every new generation.
And that means solving the problem of our real estate market.
Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is not true that it is as easy to buy homes for people living outside the UK and for foreign companies as it is for resident British workers.
For too many people the dream of owning your home has become too distant and the shame of those who sleep in retaliation remains too real."
Jack Ross: "My last ambition is to guide Scotland"
Sunderland's coach Jack Ross said that his "last ambition" is to come and select Scotland.
The 42-year-old Scotch has been successful in the challenge of giving new life to the club of the northeast, now third ranked in the First League, to three points of leadership.
He transferred to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St. Mirren on his return to the First Scottish Division at the time.
"I wanted to represent my country as a player.
But I only got a B internationalization," Ross said to BBC Scotland's Sportsound program.
"I grew up watching Scotland play in Hampden with my father and these are some of my best memories.
But that opportunity will only arise if it succeeds in club management."
Ross' predecessors as a Sunderland coach include Dick Advocat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former coach Alloa Athletic says he was not afraid to succeed in the names so consecrated in such a large club, after rejecting invitations from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, for the moment, success is summed up as "can I take the club back to the Premier League?"
Considering the club's structure and facilities, its place is undoubtedly in the Premier League", he said.
"It will not be easy to take the club back, but I will only consider that I was successful here when I reach that goal."
Ross' career as a coach is only three years old, after a period as Deputy Coach of Dumbarton and 15 months in the Hearts technical team.
He then helped Alloa recover from the descent to the third division and led St. Mirren from the threat of depromotion to the title of champion the next time.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever felt during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
Taking care of the Alloa "was a real crusade," remember.
"I've always seen myself more in the role of a coach than in the role of a player.
It seems strange because it went well, I earned my life as a player, and I had a few high moments in my career.
But playing can be very hard.
We face many challenges every week.
I still face them in terms of stress and pressure from the position, but I feel very well as a coach.
I've always wanted to train and now that I do, I feel more comfortable than ever felt during my adult life."

The perfect time for a painting is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday, according to a study
The summer heat wave filled the British pubs, but put more pressure on the chains of restaurants.
The restorative groups recorded a 2.7% growth in sales in July, but the occupation of restaurants decreased by 4.8%, showing the statistics.
Peter Martin, of the CGA consultant, who compiled the statistics, said: "The continuation of England's good time and career in the World Cup of Football, longer than expected, made the June pattern, in which the pubs recorded a 2.8% growth in sales, if repeated in July, but the restaurants knew a retreat.
The fall of 1.8% recorded in the restoration sales in June has worsened in July.
Pubs and bars with the beverage-based business had far the best performance, with a homologous growth that more than offset the descent of restaurants.
Pubs with the business based on meals also experienced difficulties, although not as dramatic as those of restoration operators.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In the pubs and bars managed directly, drinks sales rose 6.6% over the month, with meals receding 3%."
Paul Newman, from the analysis of the leisure and restoration sectors RSM, said: "These results prolong the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The meteorology and the impact of major social and sports events remain the main factors influencing the sales of the food market out of the house.
It is no surprise that restoration groups continue to face difficulties, although the annual fall in sales of 4.8% is particularly damaging when combined with the prolongation of cost pressure.
The long and hot summer could not get at a worse time for operators with the business based on meals. Only time will tell if the mildest temperatures we know in August will provide the desired relief."
The growth of the total sales of pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in brand launch.
Coffer Peach Tracker, the sector indicator of the sales of British pubs, bars and restaurants, collects and analyzes the performance data of 47 operational groups, with a combined turnover of over £9 billion, being recognized as the benchmark of the sector.
One in every five children hidden from parents secret accounts on social networks
One in every five children - some only 11 years old - has secret accounts on the social networks that hide from parents and teachers, revealed a study
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed a growth of the "false" pages on Instagram
The news aggravates fears about the publication of sexual content
Twenty percent of students said they had a "primary" account to show their parents
One in five children - some only 11 years of age - creates accounts on the social networks that hide adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed a rapid growth of "false" accounts on Instagram photo sharing site.
The news aggravates fears about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they had a "principal" innocuous account to show their parents, simultaneously having private accounts.
A mother who found her 13-year-old daughter's secret account found that the teen was urging others to "violate her."
The study, conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors (HMC) of independent schools, revealed that 40% of young people between 11 and 18 years of age had two profiles, half of which were admitted to maintaining private accounts.
HMC director Mike Buchanan said: "It is disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where their parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" at the Scottish Athletics Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected Non-Executive Director of the Scottish Council of Athletics at the Annual General Assembly of the Regulator.
Doyle is the most renowned practicer of Scottish athletics. President Ian Beattie described the appointment as an excellent opportunity for sports regulators to take advantage of their vast international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh is highly respected throughout the Scottish, British and world-wide community of athletics and we are sure that Scottish athletics will have a lot to gain with its presence in the Council," said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I'm excited to be able to act as the athletes' voice and I hope I can really contribute to help guide sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200-400-meter test at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, and a total of four Olympic gold medals, and who is currently a regular commenter at the BBC, has ceased to be able to walk after a transient ischemic vascular accident.
As he wrote on Twitter: "It's been a month since he suffered a stroke.
I stopped being able to walk.
The doctors said only the time would say if I could recover and to what extent.
It has been a difficult job but it has achieved a full recovery, I have resumed my walk and I have even done agility exercises!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!"
Milk pump announcement compares mothers to cows, dividing opinions online
A milk extraction bomb company divided opinions online with an ad comparing mothers who breastfeed cows in orderha.
To mark the launch of that which is described as the "first silent portable milk extraction pump", the consumer technology company Elvie launched an ironic announcement inspired by the music videos to highlight the freedom conferred by the new bomb to the mothers who extract milk.
Four mothers dance in a cow full of hay to the sound of a song that includes lyrics like, "Yes, I'm ordering, but I have no tail" and "You haven't noticed, I don't have tits, these are my breasts."
The saying goes, "Bombeia, pumping, feeding babies, pumping, pumping, I'm ordering my girls."
However, the ad published on the company's Facebook page generated controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying that it lightens the "horrors" of the dairy sector.
"Tree decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, only their babies are stolen a few days after birth," wrote a spectator.

Another commented: "Comprehensibly traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use them to announce an extraction bomb for mothers who can stay with their babies?"
Someone also said, "An announcement with a huge lack of sensitivity."
Others defended the announcement, like a woman who admitted to finding the song "hilarious".
"I think that's a great idea.
If I were still breast-feeding, I'd buy one.
The extraction made me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad is a bit crazy, but it makes all the sense.
This product is great," wrote one of the women.
Another commented: "It's a fun announcement directed to mothers who extract milk (often in bathrooms or at work) and feel like cows.
It's not an ad to praise or judge the dairy sector."
At the end of the video, the group of women revealed that they were dancing with the discreet bombs housed in the bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on information that many women who extract milk with bombs claim to feel like cows.
However, the Elvie bomb is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and lies discreetly within a breast-feeding bra, giving women the freedom to travel, catch their babies and even get out of the house while extracting milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and Creative Director of "Mother", commented: "The Elvie bomb is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative release.
By setting a parallel between women who extract milk and dairy cows we wanted to highlight all the challenges of milk extraction, while presenting in a fun way and with which people can identify the incredible feeling of freedom provided by the new bomb.
It wasn't the first time the Elvie bomb was covered.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children floated on the walkway to designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly displaced to a camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained reached a peak, although the monthly border crossings had remained relatively unchanged, partly because the rhetoric and severe policies introduced by the Trump administration made it difficult to match children.
Traditionally, most of the "fathers" are themselves undocumented immigrants, fearing to compromise their own possibility of staying in the country by offering to sponsor a child.
The risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that the potential fathers and other adults who integrate their family members would have to record their fingerprints, and the data were shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Customs Immigration and Control Service, witnessed to the Congress that the service had dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The service subsequently confirmed that 70% of detainees had no criminal record.
"Almost 80% of their fathers or members of their family members are illegal in the country, many of which are foreigners with criminal registration.
That's why we're going to continue to pursue these individuals," said Mr. Albence.
In an attempt to speed up the processing of children, officials have introduced new rules that require some of them to appear in court within one month of the date of detention, instead of 60 days, the previous rule, according to the officials of the reception centres.
Many are present by videoconferencing, not in person, to defend your application for legal status before a judge of the immigration court.
Those who are considered to be ineligible for aid shall be promptly deported.
The longer children remain in custody, the more likely they are to feel anxious or depressed, which may lead to access to violence or attempts to escape, according to the staff of the reception centres and with reports produced by the system in recent months.
Immigrant rights defenders say that these concerns are exacerbated in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where the large size contributes to the distress signs of children being ignored.
They add that the transfer of children to the camps without leaving time for their emotional preparation or to say goodbye to friends aggravates the trauma that many are already debating.
Syria requires immediate withdrawal of the American, French and Turkish "occupational forces"
Addressing the General Assembly of the United Nations, the Minister for Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem also requested the return of Syrian refugees to their homes, despite the war in the country in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of combating terrorism, and that "they will be treated as such".
"You must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the Assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, in a war that has left millions of displaced.
She said Damascus would continue to "walk this sacred battle until we free all Syrian territories" from both the terrorist groups and "all and any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, primarily training and advising the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in this war-torn country.
As for the question of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions for their return were assured, accusing "some Western countries" of "plowing irrational fears" that led the refugees to remain abroad.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have advised that there will be no aid for Syria's reconstruction until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to put an end to the war.
UN Diplomats claim that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a security zone at the last major rebel bastion of Idlib has created an opportunity to insist on political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement avoided a large-scale attack by the Syrian forces supported by the Russians in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem pointed out that the agreement established "clear steps" and expressed hope that military action aimed at the jiadists, including the fighters of the Al-Nusra Front associated with Al-Qaeda, who "will be eradicated".
The UN envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria, preparing the ground for elections.
Moualem established conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that the panel's work should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warning against possible interference.
Because Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Trump would be re-elected in 2020, unless, as many liberal observers probably expect, the challenge and scandals end their presidency in advance.
In that which would undoubtedly constitute "the most dramatic end of an ever-presidency"!
At the moment, there are no signs of weariness from the spectators.
Since 2014, the time hearings in noble time more than doubled to 1.05 million in CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million spectators in noble hours, a rise compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" led the cable audiences with up to 3.5 million spectators on the big news nights.
"This is a strong call for people because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, producer of the ABC program "Designed Survivor", about a cabinet chief who becomes President after an attack that destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a comedian veteran and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another theory.
Remember once you called a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The cab driver told him he was going to vote for Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
He said, "Because he makes me laugh," he told me Scovell.
Chaos have entertainment value.
Of course, unlike television programs, stories from Washington may determine the future of abortion legislation, the right to family reunion of immigrants and the health of the global economy.
Changing the program is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can give.
And yet, it is more than being an informed citizen when we are watching at the sixth hour of a debate of experts on the use by Bob Woodward of sources "with deep knowledge" in his book "Fear", the ostrich leather blouse of $15,000 Paul Manafort ("a piece of clothing full of insolence", as the Washington Post said) and the implications of the squabrous descriptions of Stormy Daniels of... um... anatomy of President Trump.
For my part, I'll never see Super Mario again in the same way.
"Part of what he has done looks like a reality show because he gives us something every night," said Brent Montgomery, director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about Trump's dynamic cast and the daily spins of the plot (antagonize with NFL, commend Kim Jong-Un).
We can't lose any episodes or we're back.
When I spoke to Mr. Fleiss this week they were 26th on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was locked in the house, seeing MSNBC while recording CNN.
He did not waste his television while Brett Kavanaugh was preparing to testify before the Senate Justice Committee, with the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
"I still remember when we did all those crazy programs and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right after all."

Significant external funding in the interim elections for the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that the 17th circle of Pennsylvania knows a flow of funding, thanks to a realignment of the electoral circles that left two holders in the race for the same place.
The recent readjustment of the Pittsburg suburban circles put in the race the Democratic Conor Lamb, who won his place in another circle in an extraordinary election last spring.
Lamb competes against another holder, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th circle of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps the new 17th circle.
The maps were redesigned after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old circles unconstitutionally favored the Republicans.
The 17th circle race sparked a bitter quarrel over the funding of the campaign among the financial arms of the major parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressal Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a tangential victory in the extremely controversial elections from March to the 18th constituency of the Congress of Pennsylvania.
This place was occupied for over a decade by a Republican and President Donald Trump won in the circle by 20 percentage points.
Analysts have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
USA considered penalizing El Salvador for supporting China, then retreating
Some diplomats pointed out that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with few protests from Washington.
President Trump had a warm encounter with the president of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017, and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled Trump Organization from the management.
Representatives of the State Department decided to call the leaders of US diplomatic representations in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after the "recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, spokesperson of the State Department, in a statement this month.
But there were only sanctions against El Salvador, which received about US$ 140 million in aid in 2017, including for the control of drug trafficking, economic aid and development.
The penalties proposed, which included cuts in financial aid and specific visa restrictions, would have severely penalized this Central American country with high rates of unemployment and homicide.
With the continuation of internal meetings, representatives of North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity, following a similar meeting last year seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from entering the United States.
But in mid-September, the top officials of the Administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to follow forward, putting aside any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has scheduled an intervention at the conference, now marked by mid-October, in a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, the diplomats said.
The three American representatives discreetly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any hard messages or punishment from Washington.
The White House spokesperson for Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to talk about the internal deliberations covered by the anonymity.
His reports were corroborated by an external analyst close to the Administration, who also requested anonymity.
Study History
The next bomb to be dropped may be the report by the legal advisor Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice by Mr Trump, on which there is currently substantial evidence in the public domain.
Mueller will be allegedly guiding his research to determine whether Trump's campaign conspired with Russia to attack the elections.
If Congress changes its hands, Trump will face the accountability of that body, while preparing to present himself again to voters and perhaps to be judged by their peers.
These are many hypotheses and I do not want to suggest that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable - or that of his equivalents in Europe.
There are choices we have to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the fight.
In 1938, some German officers were prepared to lay Hitler on a coup, as long as the West had resisted and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We broke up and lost the chance to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around points of inflexion like this, in which the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or broken.
The Americans are currently facing several of these points of inflection.
What will we do if Trump sacks Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been under threat since this newspaper reported that last year he suggested secretly recording the President, speculating on his inability to perform the position.
Rosenstein says The Times news is incorrect.
"How will we respond if the newly requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not fair and complete or if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court, despite credible accusations of sexual abuse and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the mid-term elections for a Congress responsible for Mr. Trump?
If we take these tests, democracy will be about to cross a long desert.
But I believe we're not going to fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that in time occupied my diplomatic residence.
She survived, immigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles at that table with the suastics.
With an inheritance of these, how could he not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers Optimist before the game with the Rapid of Vienna
The Rangers receive the Rapid of Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, following the impressive tie in Spain with the Villarreal at the beginning of the month, will leave them in a good position to qualify in Group G of the League Europe.
An injury on the knee prevented the average Graham Dorrans from making the first game of the time until the tie to two greedy with the Villarreal, but he believes that the Rangers can use this result as trampoline for higher flights.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old player.
"We got the game with a positive mindset and we won a point.
Perhaps we could have won near the end but, in global terms, the tie was probably the fairest result.
They were probably better in the first part but we turned and dominated in the second part.
Thursday will be another great European night.
I hope that we can achieve the three points. It will be a difficult game because they have achieved a good result in the last game, but with the support of the public, I am sure that we will give our best to achieve a positive result.
The last year was very hard, with all my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there is a good environment.
The team is good and the players are having fun; the workouts run well.
I hope we can do our best, forget about the past and achieve success."
Women are losing sleep with fear of this savings-reform account
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of what kind of care they wanted to take, few people spoke to their relatives about it.
About half of the individuals questioned in the Nationalwide study reported talking to their spouses about the cost of continuing care.
Only 10% mentioned talking to their children about the same subject.
"People want a family member to take care of themselves, but they're not having that conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the nationwide life insurance business.
Here's how to start.
Talk to your spouse and to your children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not give them knowledge of their desires in advance.
Work with your consultant and your family, discussing where and how to receive care, since these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
It involves your financial consultant: your consultant can also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Their continuing care funding choices may include a long-term traditional insurance policy, a money-valued hybrid policy to help cover these expenses or the financing through their own savings, provided that they have these values available.
Prepare legal documentation: Avoid legal battles.
Name a health care provider, choosing a person from their trust to supervise their health care and ensuring that professionals respect their wishes if they are prevented from communicating them.
Consider also the establishment of a prosecutor's office on your finances.
You should select someone you trust to make financial decisions for yourself, ensuring that your accounts will be paid if you become incapacitated.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent suffers a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medication and allergies?
Include this information in a written plan to be prepared.
"Not only financial matters are at stake, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What's the medication?
Who'll take care of the dog?
Prepare that plan."
Man shot multiple times with air pressure in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with air pressure when he returned home after a night in the city.
The victim, at the age of 40, was in the Oxford Grove area, in Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was hit in the chest, in the abdomen and in the hand.
The agents described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a "random act".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
Wounds don't involve life risks, and the police have asked for witnesses.
Sixths and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, the authorities reported, and the number of deaths is expected to increase.
With interrupted communications, rescuers were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala region, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster occurred.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi Central, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a region that stretches along more than 300 km of coastline, on the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The region, with administrative status below that of a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main economic activities of the province of Central Sulawesi, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel extraction is also important in the province, but mainly concentrates on Morrowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian disaster management agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific seismic fire ring, being regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the main earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On 26 December a strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra originated a tsunami that reached 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of which in Aceh.
2005: A series of seismos reached the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island, off Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hit south Java, the most populous island in Indonesia, leading to a tsunami that fell on the south coast, killing almost 700 people.
2009: A earthquake of magnitude 7.6 reached the city of Padang, capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit one of the Mentawai islands off Sumatra, triggering a tsunami with waves of up to 10 metres that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya region in Aceh, spreading the destruction and panic among people who remembered the devastation caused by the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time no tsunami occurred, but more than 100 people died buried under the debris of the buildings.
2018: Great earthquakes reached the tourist island Indonesia of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquakes destroyed thousands of buildings, leaving thousands of tourists temporarily isolated.
Sarah Palin's oldest child arrested for accusations of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of aggression.
Palin, aged 29, resident in Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested by suspects of domestic violence, interference in an investigation into domestic violence and resistance to detention, according to a report released on Saturday by the Alaskan police.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took his phone.
Palin is held pre-trially in the Mat-Su pre-trial detention centre, subject to a $500 bail, reported to KTUU.
He was present to the judge on Saturday, declaring himself "obviously innocent," the station reported.
Palin faces charges for three Class A offences, which means he may be sentenced to a penalty of up to one year and fined in $250,000.
He was also accused of a class B crime, punishable by a day of imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is being tried by the Alaskan Veterans Court.
In January 2016 he was accused of domestic violence, interference in the denunciation of a crime of domestic violence and possession of a weapon under the influence of alcohol, in relation to the incident.
Your girlfriend accused him of squeezing her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by veteran associations after associating the child's violent behavior with post-traumatic stress resulting from his service in Iraq.
earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died following a earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electrical and communications networks were cut off, waiting for the number of dead to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck the Southwestern Central region, north-east of the Indonesian capital, Jacarta.
They circulate videos on social networks showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Public Prosecutor's Office asks for rare capital punishment for suspected terrorist attack in New York
New York Public Prosecutor's Office calls for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack that killed eight people in the city - a rare penalty that has not been executed in the state by a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30-year-old, is accused of having used a home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack in October on a cyclist on West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, hitting pawns and cyclists.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "intentionally" and inflicted "intentionally" serious injuries, according to the notification requesting the death penalty, recorded in the South Zone of New York.
Both charges can be punished with the death penalty, according to the judicial document.
Weeks after the attack, the jury of a federal court accused Saipov of 22 crimes, including eight charges of murder at the service of organized crime, normally used by the Public Prosecutor in cases of organized crime, and an accusation of violence and destruction of motorized vehicles.
The attack demanded a "reputable planning and premeditation," the prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov executed it as "atroz, cruel and depraved".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damages and losses to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the notification states.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
A decade ago the South Zone of New York did not call for the death penalty for an accusation.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug traffickers, but the penalty was commuted to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953, when couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit spying for the Soviet Union two years earlier during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
According to the court's documentation, Saipov, a Uzbek's natural, has shown no remorse in the days and months that followed the attack.
He told the investigators to feel good about what he had done, said the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he had felt inspired to carry out the attack after seeing ISIS videos on his phone, according to the accusation.
He also asked for permission to hang the ISIS flag in the hospital room, said the police.
He declared himself innocent in relation to all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of Saipov's defense lawyers, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We think that the decision to ask for the death penalty instead of accepting a confession of guilt for life imprisonment, without the possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked accusers not to ask for the death penalty.
Conservative Member states that NIGEL FARAGE should lead the Brexit negotiations
Today, Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the popular army" during a protest at the Conservative Congress.
The former UKIP leader said that politicians should "feel pressure" on Eurocetics, while one of Theresa May's deputies suggested that he should lead negotiations with the EU.
The Conservative vice-president Peter Bone said in Birmingham's demonstration that the United Kingdom "would have gone out" if Farage was Brexit's minister.
But the challenge faced by Mrs. May to reconcile her deeply divided co-religiouss was underlined by the conservatives who defend the permanence, who organized a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister has debated to maintain his commitment plan, known as the Chequers Plan, in the face of attacks by Brexit supporters, the defenders of residence and the EU.
Allies insist that she will continue to try to reach agreement with Brussels despite the protests, forcing the Eurocetics and the Labour Party to choose between their package and the "caos".
Mr. Bone said at the Leave Means Leave beginning in Solihull that he wanted to "end the plan."
Bone suggested that Farage should have been given responsibilities in the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was responsible, we'd be out by now," he said.
Wellingborough's deputy added, "I'm going to continue to defend Brexit, but we should end the Plan."
Strengthening its opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in two World Wars to be subservients.
We want to make the laws of our own country."
Bone rejected the allegations that public opinion has changed since the referendum in 2016: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and wants to remain is totally disqualified".
The conservative defender of Brexit Andrea Jenkyns also participated in the demonstration, saying to the journalists: "I simply say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers Plan is unpopular with the public, the opposition will not approve it, it is unpopular in our own party and with the militants who take the campaigns to the street and to whom we owe our election.
Drop the Chequers Plan and start listening."
In a message addressed to Mrs May, she added: "Only the prime ministers who know how to keep their promises keep their jobs."
Farage said in the demonstration that politicians should "feel pressure" if they are willing to betray the decision of the 2016 referendum.
"This became a matter of trust between us - the people - and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them they won't get away with it."
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to pressure our political class, who is on the verge of betraying Brexit.
We want to mobilize the popular army of this country that has given us victory in Brexit and will not rest until we become an independent, proud United Kingdom and which is governed by itself."
Meanwhile, the defenders of the stay marched in Birmingham before organizing a two-hour engagement in the city center.
A crowd of activists posted tracks with the message "Conservatives against Brexit" after the launch of the group this weekend.
The Labour representative at the House of Lords, Andrew Adonis, criticized the Conservatives for the security issues they faced with an application of the party at the opening of the Congress.
"It is these people who tell us that they will have the computer systems and all the technology prepared for 'Canada more', for the friction-free border, for free trade without frontiers in Ireland," he added.
It's a complete farce.
There is no good Brexit," he concluded.
Warren plans to "put seriously" the possible candidacy of the President
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says he's going to "put seriously the candidacy to the President" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a debate in that state on Saturday.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, is a candidate for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, co-mandate of Trump's campaign in 2016 in Massachusetts.
It has been speculated that you can face Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters in debate format since Trump's takeover.
One of the participants asked whether he planned to apply for the Presidency.
Warren said it's time "for women to go to Washington to fix our government's problems and that includes a woman at the top."
Arrest in connection with the murder of Wayde Sims, LSU Tigers
Baton Rouge police, Louisiana, announced on Saturday the arrest of a suspect in the case of the murder of the basketball player of the LSU Tigers, Wayde Sims, on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m.
The police had released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying a man seen in the pictures.
Yes, 20-year-old, was shot near Southern University campus in the morning of Friday.
"Wayde Sims took a head shot, after which he died," said police chief Murphy J. Paul on Saturday, according to 247s.
Wayde defended a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted his presence on the spot, holding a gun, recognizing he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any resistance and taken to the East Baton Rouge Parish police station.
Sims, a 1.98 metre junior created in Baton Rouge, played 32 games and was held 10 times in the past season, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 recoverys per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title with a victory over Sebastian Vettel following orders from the team
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that team orders in Mercedes would play a central role in the race.
Leaving the pole position, Bottas had a good start and left Hamilton behind in defending his position on the first two curves, allowing Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went first to the boxes and made Hamilton have to face the traffic of the end of the platoon, which could have been decisive.
Mercedes went to the boxings later and went after Vettel, but Hamilton overstepped it after a reindeered skirmish, after which Ferrari's pilot reluctantly left the internal part of the free track, at risk of disqualification after a double trajectory correction to defend himself on the third curve.
Max Verstappen left the last line of the grid and was in seventh place at the end of the first round, on the day of his 21st birthday.
He then led a large part of the race, exchanging long afternoon tires, which would allow him to be fast in the final part, aiming to get past Kimi Raikkonen to finish in fourth place.
He just came to the boxes on the 44th lap but couldn't improve his pace in the last eight laps, which allowed Raikkonen to end up in room.
"It's a difficult day because Valtteri did a fantastic job throughout the weekend and was a real gentleman, letting me overdo it.
The team did an exceptional job, which allowed us to finish in the first two positions," Hamilton said.
Bad body language
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday due to his insistence that he would not reveal a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court, of sexual abuse.
Speaking at a council in Western Virginia, the President did not refer directly to Ford's testimony before the Senate's Justice Committee, noting instead that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "more, more malicious and false".
"Look at the beautiful thing that's happening in the Senate in the last few days, see the anger, see how people are bad, malicious and false," Trump said.
"When we see the leaks of information and the releases and when they say 'oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me.
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did she run away from you?
Remember her answer... did you issue the document? - 'Oh, what, what?
Oh, no.
The escape didn't start from me.'
Well, wait a minute.
The escape left us... no, it wasn't us," he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein received the letter with the details of the charges against Kavanaugh sent by Ford in July and the escape occurred in early September, but denied that the escape had departed from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't reveal his story," Feinstein told the Commission, according to The Hill.
"She asked me for confidentiality and I complied with your request."
But his denial did not convince the President, who commented on Saturday night's start: "You know, more, that was a terrible body language.
Maybe it wasn't her, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the nominee for the Supreme Court, accused of sexual abuse by three women, the President suggested that Democrats would be using charges in their behalf.
"They are determined to resume power by resorting to all means.
We see evil, malice, it doesn't matter who can achieve, who has to step up to take power and control," said the President, according to the Mediaite.

Air controller dies to help hundreds of passengers escape from earthquake
An Indonesian air controller has been hailed as a hero after dying by ensuring that a plane with hundreds of passengers leaves safely.
More than 800 people died and many are still missing after a strong earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, giving rise to a tsunami.
Powerful replicas continue to blow up the region, leaving many residents buried in the debris in the city of Palu.
But despite the fact that his colleagues had fled to save themselves, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunanan Grand refused to leave his post while the control tower violently swung at Mutiara Sis Al-Jufri airport in Palu.
It remained focused to ensure that Batik Air flight 6321, which was then on the runway, was safely off.
He then jumped out of the control tower in front of the eminent collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
The spokesperson for the Indonesian Air Navigation Agency, Yohannes Sirit, said that the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reported the Australian television network ABC News.
We sent a Balikpapan helicopter to Kalimantan to evacuate him to a major hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
"We were devastated with this news," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the number of deaths can reach the thousands, referring to the country's disaster management agency that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The balance is increasing, as there are many bodies buried by the debris that we have not yet been able to rescue," said the spokesman for the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves of up to six metres devastated Palu, where a collective funeral is held on Sunday.
Commercial and military aircraft are transporting help and maintenance to the site.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute ambulances arrive with bodies.
Drinking water is missing.
The mini-markets are being looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Cross in Indonesia is running against time to help the survivors, but we don't know what we're going to find.
The current situation is really tragic, but it could be much worse."
The President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday. According to CNN sources, he went to the local military forces and said:
"I ask you to work day and night to complete the evacuation operations. Are you ready?"
At the beginning of this year, the island of Lombok in Indonesia was hit by earthquakes that took over 550 people's lives.
Air Niugini now reports that there is a man missing after the fall of the plane in the lagoon
The airline responsible for the plane that crashed into a lagoon in Micronesia, Pacific, now reports that there is a man missing after reporting that all 47 passengers and the crew had been rescued safely from the plane sinking.
In a statement, Air Niugini said that, from Saturday to afternoon, he could not confirm the whereabouts of a male passenger.
The area company claimed to be collaborating with hospitals, researchers and local authorities to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further disclosure of the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and the crew after the plane collapsed in the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Official entities said on Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline advanced that six passengers stayed in hospital on Saturday, all of them with a stable clinical picture.
It is not yet known what was the cause of the fall or the exact sequence of events.
The airline and the U.S. Navy were unanimous in asserting that the plane failed to reach the runway and loved the lagoon.
Some witnesses thought the plane was off track.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane was coming too low.
"It was the best thing that happened," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others had managed to drag themselves through the waist and reach the aircraft's emergency exits sinking.
He said that the flight attendants had panicked and started shouting, and that he had suffered a small injury to his head.
According to the U.S. Navy, sailors who were working on a spring improvement work nearby also helped rescue by using an inflatable boat to transport people to land before the plane sinks 30 meters (100 feet) deep.
Based on data collected by Aviation Safety Network over the last two decades, 111 people died in accidents with registered PNG airlines, but none involved Air Niugini.
Analyst explains the chronology of the events of the night in which a woman was burned alive
The prosecution concluded its allegations on Saturday in the new trial of a man accused of burning alive a woman in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowllet, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, witnessed for several hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He described to the jury how he used the cell phone records to reconstruct the movements of 20-year-old Quintom Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chamber on the night of his death.
According to the newspaper Clarion Ledger, Rowlett claimed to have obtained location data from several phones confirming that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, contradicting the statements previously made.
When the data showed that your phone was with Chambers when you said you were with your friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and claimed he had not been in the city that day.
When the prosecution asked him if Tellis was telling the truth by claiming he was in his van that night, Sanford replied that he was lying because the van was in Nashville."
Another incongruence in Tellis' testimony pointed to the fact that he claimed to have met Chambers about two weeks ago when he died.
Cell phone records indicated that they only met one week ago.
Rowlett stated that, sometime after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted SMS messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He paid her for her life," Hale said.
The defence should begin to present its final allegations on Sunday.
The judge said that he hoped that the trial would begin to be examined by the jury at the end of that day.
The High Breed: What is the conscious hip hop?
A trio of hip hop wants to change the negative tone of the genre by filling up your music with positive messages.
Bristol's The High Breed Group states that hip hop has deviated from its roots of political orientation and social criticism.
They want to return to these roots and restore popularity to the conscious hip hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have witnessed a recent rebirth in the UK thanks to the intervention of other performers, such as Akala and Lowkey.
One more black?!
New York Nanny process couple by dismissal through a "racist" SMS message
A New York lover is prosecuting a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a text message from her mother wrongly complaining that she was "a black one more".
The couple denied the accusations of racism, claiming that the trial was an act of "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, showed some fear when she discovered that the new lover Giselle Maurice was black when she presented herself for her first day of work in 2016.
"I can't believe... but a price," Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in an SMS message.
However, instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent it to Giselle Maurice... twice.
According to the New York Post, when you noticed your gap, a "pregnant" Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman fired Giselle Maurice alleging the poor performance of the former African-American lover and who was waiting for a Filipino lover.
Giselle Maurice was paid for his only day's work and sent to Uber's house.
Now, Giselle Maurice is prosecuting the couple and requesting a redundancy compensation of USD 350/day for the six-month period for which she had been chosen without a contract.
"I want to show you that you can't be punished," said the Post on Friday, adding "I know this is discrimination."
The couple rejected the allegations of racism, saying that firing Giselle was perfectly logical because they feared they could not trust her after they had offended her.
"My wife sent him something I didn't really mean to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racist people," said Joel Plasco to the Post.
"Would you entrust your children to someone who had been treated badly, even if by mistake?
Your newborn son?
I can't believe it."
By naming the process of "extortion," Plasco said that his wife had been a mother only two months ago and had to deal with "a very difficult situation."
"Are you going to chase someone like that?
It's not very nice," the investment banker added.
While the legal process takes place, the court of public opinion was quick to condemn the couple on social networks, criticizing their behavior and reasoning.
New letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared that readers might not identify with a talking bear
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted commented the letter: "It's hard to get on the skin of someone who first read it before it was published.
It's really fun to know this now, after Paddington's been so successful."
He commented that his father, who worked as a camera operator of the BBC before being inspired by a little bear of playing to write the children's book, would not have taken to heart if the book had been rejected, and added that the 60-year anniversary of the publication had a rough taste given his death last year.
About Paddington, who described as "a very important member of our family," said the father was very proud of his success.
"He was a modest man and not a person given to the gabarolice," he said.
"But as Paddington was as real to him, it was as having a successful son: we are proud even when the fact is not ours.
I think that's how I saw Paddington's success.
Despite being the result of his imagination, he always attributed credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying, and I had to get fired on my phone.
Soon after the landing, the daughter had been taken from emergency to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors fought in vain to save her life.
"Nad often called to say that the situation was really bad and that there was no chance of survival," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then Nad called to say she was going to die in the next two minutes and that she had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, my dear.
We'll be together soon.
Together.
The drugs that the doctors had given him to keep the heart running were slowly giving up and leaving their system.
He had been dead for some time and all his organs were stopping.
I had to stay there and wait, knowing all this was happening.
I couldn't scream or complain because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to hold myself back."
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving over the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with other passengers outside the proof that she was going through.
"No one knew," I said.
"I always cried low-headedly.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt enormous compassion for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women of mourning affix cards on bridge to avoid suicides
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide struggle to prevent others from following the same path.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted cards on a Welsh bridge with motivation messages and phone numbers that people can use to receive support.
Tyler, Sharon Davis' son, was 13 when he started suffering from depression and 18 when he committed suicide.
"I don't want any father to feel what I feel every day," he said.
Sharon Davis, 45-year-old and Lydney resident, said his son was a promising head with a contagious smile.
"He was known for his smile.
They all said I was lighting up the room."
However, he gave up his job before he died because he had "stumbled in darkness."
In 2014, Tyler was found dead by his 11-year-old brother.
Sharon Davis said, "I'm always worried about a possible impact."
Sharon Davis created the postcards "so they know there are people who are available to help and who they can talk to, or even be a friend.
Don't close up on yourselves, you have to talk."
Kelly Humphreys, a long-time friend of Sharon Davis, lost Mark, his partner 15 years ago, very soon after the mother-in-law's death.
"I didn't say I was sad or depressed," he said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas Day, there was a rag, when the kids opened their presents, they didn't even look at them."
He said his death traumatized them a lot, but it's something they have to overcome: "Destruct a family.
Nobody's indifferent.
But we all have to keep living and fighting."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is at stake with the start of the FBI investigation.
"I thought that by terms like what I had asked for - a time and scope investigation - we could be more united," said Jeff Flake on Saturday, advancing that I feared the committee was "disappearing" in the face of a entrenched partisan impasse.
Why didn't Brett Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters investigate the FBI?
Its reluctance is a purely temporal issue.
Intermediate elections are only five weeks away. On November 6, if, as expected, Republicans have bad results, they will see their attempts to elect their candidate to the frustrated Supreme Court.
George W. Bush has contacted the senators to pressure them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and through whom he met the wife Ashley, the personal secretary of Bush at that time.
What happens after the FBI presents its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where I now sit 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not true that Kavanaugh can obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to cast his vote of resignation and confirm his place in the Supreme Court.
Number of deserters in North Korea decrease during Kim's regime
According to a South Korean legislature, the number of North Korean deserters for North Korea has decreased since the rise to power of Kim Jong-un seven years ago.
When citing data from the Ministry of South Korea’s Unification, Park Byeong-seug indicated that there had been 1127 desertions last year compared to 2706 of 2011.
Park said that the stricter border controls between North Korea and China, as well as the fact that smugglers of people asked for more money, were the main factors.
Pyongyang did not make any public declaration.
Overall, South Korean citizenship is granted to the vast majority of deserters in North Korea.
Seoul reported that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers that the deserters are illegal immigrants and not refugees, and it is common to repatriate them.
Relations between North Korea and South Korea (technically still at war) have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the denuclearization negotiations that are at a standstill.
The conversations took place after the historic meeting in June between the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, during which they agreed, in general, to collaborate in the creation of an unnuclearized Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Ministers, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the US for the lack of progress.
"Without confidence in the U.S., there will be no confidence in our national security and in these circumstances it is impossible for us to take the first steps towards unilateral disarmament," Ri said in a speech at the United Nations Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is hysterical and unfit to serve in the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, leader of the minority in the House, said Brett Kavanaugh, candidate for the Supreme Court, was hysterical and temperamentally unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview given on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if a woman had behaved like this, she would soon be called hysterical," Pelosi said about her reaction to the testimony of Kavanaugh before the Senate Judicial Committee on Thursday
Kavanaugh emotionally denied all sexual abuse laws to Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh made a statement of emotional openness, sometimes in a shrill, solving voice, talking about his family and high school years.
He also explicitly accused the committee's Democrats, calling for the allegations made against him of "gross and conspiracy murder" organized by Liberals angry by Hillary Clinton's loss of the presidential elections in 2016.
Perisi said he believed that the testimony of Kavanaugh proves that he has no conditions to serve in the Supreme Court given his preconceived behavior against Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with his statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and Democrats," he said.
When asked whether he would try to challenge the effective appointment of Kavanaugh and if the Democrats won the majority in the House of Representatives, Pelossi hesitated.
"What I can say is that if you lie to Congress or the FBI, you don't meet the conditions to be in the Supreme Court, or even to serve in your current court," Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh is a judge at the Court of the Relation of the District of D.C.
He added that as a Democrat, he was afraid of potential opinions from Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act (known as Obamacare) or the Roe vs Wade case, given the reputation of being a conservative judge.
During the confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh raised questions about the possibility of abrogating certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This is not a time for electing someone hysterical and preconceived to the Supreme Court and waiting for us to be happy with the decision," Pelosi said.
Women need to be able to control emotions.
It's a justified diatribe, months and years of rage overflowing, and it can't take off without crying.
"We cheer when we get angry," Mrs Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's anything strange, do I?"
A woman with an executive position in a company helped me a lot. She told me that she was also crying when she got angry, but she had created a technique. When she was angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, "I don't think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And he kept going.
And I thought of myself... it's brilliant," continued Mrs. Steinem.
Tears are accepted when they express anger because, in a more common context, they are misunderstood.
I remember perfectly well, in an old job in an office dominated by men in which I cried inexpressible anger, being held by the neck by an older woman - an unfriendly manager who terrorized me a little - and literally dragged to the stairs to hear her say
"Never let them see you cry."
"They don't know if you're angry.
They think you're sad and they're gonna be happy because they've been able to affect you."
Patricia Schroeder, the former Democratic Congressman of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Gary Hart was caught in an extra-conjugal relationship on board a boat called Monkey Business and gave up the candidacy, an extremely frustrated Patricia Schroeder did not see why she could not apply to the presidents herself.
"It wasn't a very thoughtful decision," he told me to laugh 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates and one more was simply unnecessary.
There was someone who called the situation of "The Snowwhite and the Seven Years."
In view of its late entry, the fund-raising was below the desirable and he argued that he would only enter the race if he could earn $2 million.
A battle condemned to defeat.
He discovered that some of his supporters only gave him $250, although they had given $1,000 to male candidates.
"Do you think I have the right to a discount?" he wondered.
When he announced that he would not go into a formal campaign, the emotions came to the top of gratitude for the people who had supported him, frustration with a system that raises so many obstacles to fundraising and bring the message to voters instead of delegates, and angered against sexism, and tears arose.
"So far it seemed that she was depressed," recalled Patricia Schroeder, speaking of the media reaction.
"I would have thought Kleenex was my business sponsor.
What would they now write in my epitaph?

How trade war between the U.S. and China can be beneficial to Beijing
The first salvation of the trade war between the US and China was shocking, and although the end of the conflict is not in sight, in the perspective of the experts, the distancing of the two countries may be beneficial for Beijing in the long term.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, fired the first warning at the beginning of the year at taxing important Chinese imports including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
This week was the stage of a significant worsening of the situation with the new rates affecting goods worth $200 billion (150 billion pounds), effectively charging half of all goods sent by China to the U.S.
Beijing has always retaliated in the same currency, and has recently raised rates from 5 to 10 percent for U.S. goods worth $60 billion.
China has committed itself to following the U.S. steps and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will waver in the near future.
Making Washington back would mean yielding to the demands, but showing U.S. public subservience would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing makes good use of its truffles, the pressures imposed by trade war with the US can positively support China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of both economies.
"In fact, the fact that an unintended political decision in Washington or Beijing can result in an economic crisis in both countries is far more dangerous than observers could ever have anticipated," said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher who was studying Asia at the Center for New American Security, a reflection group.
Minister for Foreign Affairs states that Syria is prepared for the return of refugees
Syria claims to be prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for assistance in the reconstruction of a country devastated by more than seven long years of war.
In his speech at the General Assembly of the United Nations, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moualem, stated that the conditions of the country are improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
There are now all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country who have left because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that over 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people who have remained in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would gladly receive aid for the reconstruction of the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from the countries that sponsored the revolt.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The Selection of Europe beats the US and wins the 2018 Ryder Cup with a final score from 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National around Paris, France.
The U.S. now accumulate six consecutive defeats on European soil since the last time they won Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe is back victorious after the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reaches the 14.5 points they needed to hit the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who demonstrated serious difficulties during most of the tournament, pulled the tee out of the water into the hole 16, par 3, giving Francesco Molinari the victory.
The Italian golfer Molinari has shined in all its rounds, becoming 1 of the 4 players to get 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth lost 5&4 for the worst ranked player of the Selection of Europe, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's most well-classed player Dustin Johnson lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from England in which he may have been his last participation in Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, the Spanish Sergio Garcia became the most prized European of all tournaments with 25.5 points of career.
"It's not my habit to cry, but today I couldn't stop.
It was a tough year.
I can't stop thanking Thomas for choosing me and believing me.
I'm so glad we won the cup.
It was all a team effort and I'm happy that I was able to help," said Garcia, an emotional woman after Europe's victory.
Pass the word to your compatriot Jon Rham who defeated the American Gulf legend, Tiger Woods, by 2&1 in singular on Sunday.
"It's impossible to describe the pride I feel of having defeated Tiger Woods. I grew up to see him play," said Rahm, 23-year-old.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a 13-21-3 record at Ryder Cup.
Unusual statistical values of one of the biggest players of all time with 14 great titles won and just beaten by Jack Nicklaus.
With the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Financed that had a high-caliber performance throughout the tournament, the remaining elements of the US Selection were discussed for reaching the fairway.
The American captain, Jim Furyk, spoke after the disappointing performance of his team. "I pride myself on them. They fought.
This morning, we managed to put some fear into Europe.
We fought.
My congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of your 12 players were excellent.
We will reorganise ourselves and I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Commission to continue.
I like a lot of these 12 players and I'm proud to be your captain.
I have to take my hat off the other team.
They were better."
