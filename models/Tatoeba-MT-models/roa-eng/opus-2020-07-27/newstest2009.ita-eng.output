The Prague Stock Exchange at the closing of the market had a negative collapse.
After the fall of the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange restored the losses.
The transactions of the CEZ shares have reached almost half of the daily daily trade.
From the beginning of Tuesday, the Prague Stock Exchange resumed from the collapse of the day before it was almost 6%.
Behind this downfall is the collapse of the shares on Wall Street.
So, also from us, there is a reaction from the market to the result of the vote of the House of Representatives in America, which refused to support the stabilisation plan of the local financial sector.
Action collapse in Asia
On Tuesday the shares of the Asian Stock Exchanges experienced a dramatic collapse, although the indexes, however, during the day they subsequently cancelled some of the losses.
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange Hang Seng index during the day cancelled almost 4%, but then also part of the losses stabilized at 2.5%.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which follows the Chinese stock movement at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, has dropped by 3.8% while in Shanghai the markets have been closed.
The Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than 5%, but eventually the losses were 4.3%.
The Thay-Wan Stock Exchange, according to the local index, declined by 3.6%.
"The planning of the rescue action is uncertain and it will affect financial markets all over the world," noted the Head of the Hong Kong Currency office Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, although part of China, manages its own financial policy, so it does not depend on the Central Bank.
Hong Kong has interest rates at the same level as the United States.
American legislators, according to Australian premier Kevin Rudd, should quickly return to dialogue and approve the proposal for financial support.
Otherwise there is a risk that other countries will suffer consequences as well.
U.S. share stratum
The U.S. Parliament rejected the financial system support plan for which $700 billion (almost 12 billion of Czech crowns) had to be allocated.
The legislators thus ignored President Bush's appeal to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the whole economy.
The American actions Monday have experienced a ruin and the main indexes of the shares have recorded the largest collapse since more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index dropped by almost 7% and a collapse of similar dimensions was observed the last time in 1987.
The index was lowered already before the vote, but as soon as the bill was not approved, it fell free.
The Congress has given up: the U.S. government can leverage 700 billion dollars to banks.
The highest representatives of the U.S. Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of economic support for the American financial system.
The vote on this will be at the beginning of next week.
The US legislators broke the ice in the dialogue on the approval of the rescue plan in the form of economic aid for the American financial system for a total of 700 million dollars (almost twelve billion crowns).
But it's not said yet.
The representatives of the Congress, therefore, need to define some details of the agreement before publishing the final form of the law and voting on it.
The financial system support plan will be discussed on Monday on the territory of the House of Representatives.
Sunday said so to the agency Reuters, the chairman of the committee for banking and financial services in the Barney Frank room.
In the Senate, according to some sources, you could vote about the plan probably not before Monday.
According to the economists, the announcement that the financial plan will be approved should be the first and fundamental psychological factor capable of awakening financial markets.
But then there will be a return to reality because of the complexity of the mechanisms with which, in practice, to reach market aid.
Paulson: The Plan must be effective
"We've taken a big step forward."
"We have clarified our differing views on the format of the presentation of the market stabilisation package," said the Democratic Nancy Pelossi to Bloomberg Agency.
According to the same , the final vote could still take place on Sunday.
The representatives of the legislators met on the night between Saturday and Sunday with the American Finance Minister Henry Paulson, to give final form to the government's financial funds.
These funds should be used to acquire non-transferable mortgage assets from financial companies, which lead to serious losses and jeopardise the stability of the entire system.
"We are completing the final agreement of the plan that will work and that must also be effective on the market."
"It is necessary to carry the recovery plan further, but I believe we are," Paulson said.
The signal for Asian trade
The global financial crisis falls heavily on the stock markets that are falling sharply.
According to the Democratic Senator of Nevada Harry Reid, the legislators are trying to reach a final agreement at the Congress even before Sunday.
In other words, they want to calm investors before trade in Asian financial markets, which are, in time, the first to influence the Monday market following the Congress's decision.
But for now it is definitely not clear when the two Houses of the American Congress will vote on the law and even if negotiations can be stopped at the last moment on some issues.
The legislators hope that it will be approved in the next few days.
But the law will still undergo many changes.
The total amount envisaged for system support shall be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion dollars must be available as soon as possible as President George Bush asked.
But Congress can block the remainder of the sum if it will have the impression that the program does not perform its function, blocking the next $100 billion and after the end 350.
Bush appreciated the progress in the negotiations.
Although the President may veto this decision, the Congress may, however, override its veto right.
Despite these changes, the basic thought of the program has remained, i.e. to get the finances to buy the passive mortgage values, whose price has plummeted because of hundreds of thousands of Americans who are unable to pay their mortgages.
"We've drawn up everything.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the Sunday law and the Monday Senate," said the Republican Senator.
Progress in negotiations is also met by American President Bush.
His spokesperson Tony Fratto said Bush is satisfied with the positive performance of Saturday and appreciates "the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy".
Restriction of golden parachutes
The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee Christopher Dodd, the lead spokesperson, said that the legislators had agreed on the responsibility of the financial programme, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the closure of the budget of the reductions, the division of the financial plan.
The new law must also limit the so-called golden parachutes for the managers of the companies participating in the programme and is setting up a committee that will control the funds.
These should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard and we have taken a big step towards the agreement that will work and will be useful for the market and also for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan counts on aid to the owners of the houses that have payment problems.
The government should negotiate the new mortgage rates that it will buy with the objective of lowering monthly debt payments and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: psychological support
The proposed plan is, according to the main economy of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea but its realization will be very difficult.
"And that's why we don't know how and for what price the problem assets will be bought.
This will be crucial for how the financial sector and the government will divide their losses," Marek said this week for the iHNed.cz website.
If the plan will be approved now or at the beginning of next week, according to Marek, it is not so fundamental.
"A lot more importantly, it is already this week that the representatives of the Congress find an agreement on the support of this plan and that they baptize it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of this agreement that will be approved is at this time more important," Marek said.
Last blood duel: MP3 players against mobile phones
We will recommend how to choose
While almost every cell phone can read MP3 files, no MP3 player can call.
From this it is clear that it is best to buy just the phone.
Despite this, there are many reasons why an autonomous reader should be procured.
The choice depends entirely on the way of use and the needs of the future owner.
Perhaps you would hardly buy a expensive high-quality turntable to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
First of all, these musical products do not come out as LP and from a qualitative point of view for this reason there is no objective reason.
But if you've got hard-rock, jazz or blues vinyls in your shelves, you'll probably get a little bit of a turntable like that.
It also works with portable music, i.e. compressed music or simply MP3 format.
Here, too, there are the price and quality categories.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend for an 8 thousand crown player, as well as a Pink Floyd fan perhaps hardly digests headphones from twenty crowns of the market.
Two extremes of which there is enough room for everyone.
The choice is wide.
The decision is the duration of the batteries.
Some high-quality music readers can do much more than simply read music, but they don't make cell phones even by mistake.
There is no other current device as universal as the mobile phone.
Along with primary functions, call and send sms, you can read music and video, record both and have a camera, sometimes better sometimes worse and maybe you can also navigate.
And if we consider smartphones and palm trees you will also have a miniature computer in your pocket.
It is a small miracle that no refrigerator can do the grill and no television can photograph anything.
The universality of the mobile phone also brings disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your phone and first the indicator on your screen will require the charger.
And reading music consumes a lot of energy.
Few cell phones can read the music for more than 12 hours, usually, and much less.
In this sense, music readers (especially the simplest ones) are much more effective.
As far as economic phones are concerned, they can last for more than a few hours.
If you still add us, from time to time, some calls, get yourself to work for safety another charger, this also applies to the most expensive appliances.
But you will not have this problem with an MP3 player, even the worst lasts at least 9 hours on continuous functionality with a charge.
A further problem exists when you download the music in your mobile phone.
Unfortunately only a limited part of devices has the universal USB port and not all can connect to the computer without a special software.
Certainly the music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only a few memory readers are able to do it without adapter for minicards that are not used in mobile phones.
Readers, except for some exceptions (Ipod) do not need any special software.
Just fill the device with the music via USB from the computer.
Most phones and readers create themselves a multimedia library ordered according to the names of the performers, album names, genre or user classification.
Some devices only reproduce the folder tree structure, similar to the Explorer tool in Windows, and some know how to do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent phones with operating system).
Readers are easier to handle, mobile phones can do more.
When you choose a particular device you are especially interested in battery resistance, memory capacity, quality and type of audio outputs and clearly ease of use.
If the music serves you mainly as a background and if you listen to it every day only briefly on the tram you just need a mobile phone any that reads MP3.
This can now, clearly, be done on any cell phone.
You don't have to take too much care of what your phone or reader formats recognize.
MP3 players support them all, the overall majority of the music that comes to you will be in this format.
In addition to this format that belongs to the most common ones, the total majority of devices support music in WMA format.
There is less AAC (format used by Apple and its Ipods).
Best mobile phones also allow you to buy music online, for example.
Simply visit, through the mobile internet network, the corresponding pages of the operator (or another supplier) and buy the song or album.
This same service could already be a valid topic to buy a mobile-reader.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is poor and is usually limited only to hits of the time of the radio.
Prices are not very low.
But it is generally assumed that this very mode of sale of music (either via GSM, internet or wireless internet) in the future will dominate the music industry.
Most people always take their cell phone back.
Anyone who wants to listen to something in his pocket is missing the MP3 player at home.
However, it also depends on this, if you always carry behind the headphones or at least the wireless earphone.
If not, you can use the built-in player that almost every cell phone, but only a small part of MP3 players, has.
Perhaps the biggest advantage of mobile readers will, for many, be the price.
The cheaper ones normally cost less than 3 thousand crowns.
For 3 and 4 thousand crowns you will already buy a very dignified walkman.
Usually, however, you will be limited by the absence of an entrance for the common headphones.
The best and technically equipped mobile phones and also with the 3.5 mm grip for the common headphones, cost up to 15 thousand crowns.
Instead, the benefit of readers is, in addition to others, easy handling.
The simplest ones not necessarily cheaper (see our choice) really do to anyone to handle them.
The minimum of functions, the similarity of handling once with the common stereo or perhaps the turntable, is obvious.
There is no danger of hitting by mistake the start of the mobile internet network and as a result of a giant bill for data transmission.
Which apparatus to take
Even cheaper mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have an interchangeable memory card slot (e.g. M2, microSD etc.).
Also with regard to the purchase of the respective card, falling within the 2 000 crowns.
But be careful.
The base models only support cards with the maximum capacity of 2GB.
Only the most expensive ones do it with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy even a cheap MP3 player, take Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not have to spend more than 1 100 crowns.
If you are one of the most demanding listeners, you will prefer your specialized mobile phones - walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have individual MP3 keys and the comfort of the service so close to the same MP3 player.
In this area, Sony Ericsson has made more of the way, which walkman-line mobile phones have the same scale of use as MP3 players sold separately.
The MP3 players of the above-mentioned brands provide you with the same service and price category up to 4 000 crowns, but with a higher memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery resistance (commonly 15 hours, in principle up to 35 hours).
The first virtual operator will reach the Czech Republic since this year.
Maybe
Perhaps the mobile telephony market in the Czech Republic is quite mature and our operators offer virtually all services like their partners in Western Europe.
However, there is something missing – a virtual operator that obligates traditional ones to lower the price.
Maybe it won't be long.
Since the Czech operators belong to the most dear ones in Europe, we have already written many times on Mobil.cz.
Finally, ČTú confirmed that the price of SMS is higher than in the rest of the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of regulating roaming tariffs, perhaps a paradoxical situation will be created - for some customers of mobile operators in the Czech Republic SMS will cost less from abroad than at home.
How is it possible for prices in the Czech Republic to remain so high against Europe?
The answer is simple, lacks the competition that would really want to start the fight.
Maybe it sounds absurd, even here we have three mobile networks and high coverage over 100 %.
On the other hand, mobile telephony operators like to lag behind the fact that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this sense, the head of the Czech Telecommunications Council (ČTú) , Pavel Dvořák , who has once expressed that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It is perhaps true that the traditional operator with his network has probably no more possibilities. (For the rest it might be difficult to find other frequencies now).
But there is still another possibility - the virtual operator.
The entry into the market of virtual operators has led to a considerable drop in prices, to which the traditional operators would have to react.
At the same time before the entry of sharks such as Tesko Mobile and Virgin Mobile into the market, voices similar to ours were echoed in Britain.
However, it has been shown that the place for such operators is there and that they can really succeed.
Finally, we must not go too far.
In February of this year we informed you of the arrival of the Virtual Operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this operator managed to win more than 100 thousand customers and become the fifth largest local operator.
At the same time behind Mobilking is the Penta financial group to which the Czech Republic belongs among others U:fon.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a much more concrete task force.
In order to actually function, it is enough for many less customers than a traditional operator.
They do not carry behind, i.e., relatively high costs for the creation, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
So in the world, virtual operators usually present themselves at low cost, offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often in balance with the most restricted services offer
So for example Tesco Mobile in Great Britain offers texts that cost at least half compared to its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can be a pretty good move, even the bet on a group-brick not recently.
This operator points to so specifically on men.
"Real men choose Mobilking operator that they like and can trust" says David Seibertz CEO Mobile Entertainment Company that produces this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept can be said by us as in Poland.
It doubts the press spokesman for Vodafone Miroslav Čepický: "The Czech market is relatively small for a fragmented approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, services are relatively saturated."
In the Czech Republic, no possibilities, say mobile network operators
But it seems almost certain that if there is ever an operator in the Czech Republic it will not be Mobilking.
"There is talk about the expansion of this successful project, but negotiations in the Czech Republic do not have much expectations.
Mobilking's ignition will happen rather in other countries in our area," said in a telephone dialogue for Mobile.cz Jana Studničková, the press spokesman for the Penta financial group.
It has thus indirectly confirmed that current operators in the Czech Republic are not very favourable to this view.
Rather, they are trying to do everything because they do not create any potential competitors.
For a while he has not hidden his interest in starting a virtual operator, the GTS Novera group that would thus like to take another step to become a real competitor of Telefónika O2 in the business customer field.
"We have a great interest in being able to offer our customers not only fixed services but also mobile telecommunications.
And first you get better is.
We have repeatedly negotiated this possibility with all the Czech operators of the mobile network.
We have already made progress in negotiations with some of them," says the spokesman for the Pavel Kaidl Group.
So maybe better times will come.
Unofficial information shows that the first virtual operator will have to have it by the end of the year.
But for now around its creation there is an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At this moment we do not believe that in the Czech market there is room for the creation of a full-fledged virtual operator.
The Czech market, unlike other markets, is very specific.
So far no subject with a complex and serious project has turned to us," he mentioned in his statement for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sršeň of the press section of Telefónika O2.
The specific nature of the Czech market also applies to other operators.
The press spokesman for T-Mobile Martina Kemrová adds in a rare agreement with the O2 statement: "For now we have not noticed any vital and beneficial commercial project for both, on which it is possible to continue to build".
And he adds: "In the T-Mobile network, a virtual operator will hardly appear by the end of the year.
At this point we must have had a concrete agreement on the table, so that it could be considered on the horizon."
Vodafone concentrates his attention rather than reaching his applications for the 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický adds: "We are open to the negotiations of potential virtual operators, especially in the area of cost-sharing and infrastructure.
Let us consider this, from the point of view of the customers, the most productive.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a common network for fast mobile internet."
The competent authorities - with the complicit operators
The attitude of mobile telephony operators can easily be understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would lead to lower prices and thus lower profit.
Why then facilitate the rise of such a competitor?
The discomforts around creation U:fon testify that when operators hold to something they know how to bind on the same side.
Perhaps the great pressure against ČTú during the creation period of U:fon towards the company of T-Mobile.
This bears witness to the public access information from the ČTú websites.
But right now U:fon serves as an argument for which not to accept the virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová observed: "The environment of competition in the mobile market has been little boosted further with the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
With regard to the type of mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that the entry of another competitor would bring about him and above all his high services.
However, the attitude of mobile operators is quite surprising the total lack of interest on the part of the Czech regulators.
It is not only the attitude of ČTú that unfortunately in the Czech Republic - unlike Britain and other developed countries - has no competence to interfere in economic competition.
It belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (UOHS).
This, however, has taken up its typical position with regard to the whole problem.
"The virtual operator's entry into the mobile telephony market would be possible after the conclusion of the contract of the rental of the necessary infrastructure between the mobile operator and the virtual operator had been concluded.
No such contract has been concluded so far because the offer of potential buyers was probably not interesting enough for traditional operators," said Kristián Chalupa, the Section for External Relations UOHS, in response to our question.
Such a statement by the representatives of the operators is perhaps not surprising.
On the other hand, the office which has to defend the interests of consumers and, above all, take care that no one takes advantage of its position on the market is more than a delicate affair.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "Outside where virtual operators work commonly, we can see that their market entry has contributed to lower prices for mobile services."
But, of course, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the lowering of prices do not belong to the interests of UOHS.
Truly shocking throughout the situation is the almost exciting harmony of these three operators resulting from their reactions.
The question of whether this is really just a coincidence, is left alone.
The same as the same price of petrol for all petrol is certainly the fruit of coincidence and competitive struggle.
"The section found no signs of anti-competitive behaviour regarding this fact and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
No operator has a dominant position, so he has no corresponding responsibility for his behaviour on the market.
The necessary tools for the opening up of the mobile network market for virtual operators may also be missing from the telecommunications regulator," Chalupa mentioned in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many controversial points .
Of course, there is the analysis of the relevant markets drawn up by ČTú, according to which telecommunications are from the point of view of economic competition the only market.
On such a market, of course, no Czech operator has a dominant position.
But some legal experts offer another approach - for the creation of a virtual operator the agreement of the network operator is always necessary.
And the mobile operator has – at the end of the accounts logically – the monopoly of its network.
So for a certain portion it must be dominant by force.
But even if we do not admit this argument, for UOHS it should be a minimum warning that three mobile operators do in such a strangely similar way.
At the same time the complaints from the stakeholders (including the aforementioned company GTS Novera) show that during the negotiations with all operators they encounter very similar obstacles.
Download responsibility to ČTú in telecommunications is a fairly frequent trick with which UOHS keeps itself out of the way.
We have already found this in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, ČTú's rights in the field of economic competition in telecommunications were not promoted until the recently approved telecommunications law was updated, despite the fact that many experts expected to improve the situation.
That is what UOHS representatives need to know more than good, but perhaps their interests are elsewhere.
It can be done, when no one looks
While we are not aware of this, the operation of such pseudo-virtual operators remains, some of which even exist in the Czech mobile networks.
These are companies that publish their own mobile phone services prices which are only partially public.
These are usually the multilevel marketing companies.
So for example Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and a number of others offer their mobile services.
The price lists of these companies usually reach only pre-established persons.
The magic lies in the fact that the company against the operator appears as a classic company customer, which orders a large amount of SIM card.
As an important customer then receives special price offers (and more).
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit a similar pre-sales.
"If the cases you're talking about, of which we're going to be interested, could be a breach of the contractual conditions, and could lead to the conclusion of cooperation with that company," replied Martina Kemrová.
But it is unlikely that such an activity would not reach the ears of those responsible for mobile operators.
Especially in the cases of the three companies mentioned it can be thousands of customers.
No operator defends himself from such an attitude at the same time.
From the activity of these companies there is a non-indifferent profit and at the same time - unlike real virtual operators - they are not damaged in any way with their official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns about possible problems: "The law allows such speculations, however only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
They must also accept that the SIM card on their phone is not registered on their behalf, so they cannot fully dispose of it as the usual customers of mobile operators "
But this should be a bit strange to ČTú.
In addition there is another question for UOHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes to such an attitude, why block the creation of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that UOHS has strong enough rights to reveal similar activities and if it does not wish to be satisfied with the explanation of operators who have no idea of all this and that their business conditions prohibit it.
When we're no longer expensive
As the text has already been mentioned several times, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile phone market has led to a significant decrease in prices for services.
At the same time in virtually all the countries where the operators were born, traditional operators tried more or less to prevent their creation.
The arguments they used were practically identical - market too small, too saturated limit, problems with the quality of services etc.
But in the developed countries in these cases the regulators intervened to defend not mobile operators but their customers.
Both with the formal measures and with the non-formal pressure, then came to the creation of the first virtual operator and to him others agreed.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators are launching the whole case from one to the other like a boiling potato.
For our experience, we cannot get rid of the feeling that the lack of clarity of skills in these cases makes him more comfortable.
But we don't throw away the sponge.
If the information of the backstage is correct and the virtual operator will really appear from us soon, the Czech mobile phone market will get back on the bike.
If one of the operators had consented to the creation of a virtual mobile operator only hardly UOHS could remain improbable to the refusal (discrimination) of the others concerned.
And we may stop calling at higher prices than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best one
Listen to the four new versions of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the day of recognition of the Czech State solemnly presented the new recordings of the national anthem "Kde domov můj".
The new recording of the hymn was made by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available – solo with male or female voice, choir step and instrumental edition.
The song is under the direction of Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the anthem are Otakar Jeremiaš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz site you can listen to all four versions.
Bělohlávek considers Czech national song one of the most beautiful inni.
Already before he told the radio "Český rozhlas" that he has chosen specifically to sing the variants alone, the singers with the most representative young voices, which are expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I tried to take care that both and the choir, have the clear word, that the text is well understood, that they are in harmony," he said.
Then the national anthem will celebrate next year's 175th anniversary.
The song "Kde domov můj" was played for the first time in 1834 on the stage of the Stavovskéh divad it in the original work Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl accompanied by the music of František Škroupa.
He bought popularity and people spontaneously made it his.
The first stanza of the song after the founding of Czechoslovakia in 1918 then became the natural part of the national anthem.
It remained one of seven national symbols even after the birth of the autonomous Czech Republic.
How the "new" inno sounds
On Wednesday MHD in Prague will accompany you for the first time also with an electronic card
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be written in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date on which in the metro, tram and buses will go up the first passengers who, instead of the paper ticket, will have an electronic card in their pocket.
At the moment if you can get it about 100,000 people who own your Opencard card.
Passengers can buy that from 30 days and 90 days per year (which will vary from 1st January 2009) and at the same time have their own paper recharged in the Infopoints and in the Transport Company offices and at the Möstek metro station, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
The sizes can already be purchased from yesterday on the Internet at the Company of Transport page www.dpp.cz.
The service took advantage of over 400 customers before the afternoon.
Those who will start using the Internet service can completely forget the doors in the subway stops where so far they had to make long files for paper tickets.
The cutting is purchased via the internet and on the Opencard they charge it on one of the twelve branches of the Municipal Library.
"In these places, passengers have a handbag with trained staff that will help those interested in buying on the internet and will also record on their card the credit acquired." said project spokesman Martin Opatrný.
In addition, libraries will be able to load electronic cuttings on the Opencards in ATMs and selfservices that are installed at the entrances of the metro.
How are these ATMs?
They are red, similar to ticket oblivors and passengers have already noticed them at the stops of the Roztyly metro, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Now there are five in the whole city but by the end of the year there should be eighty," Opatrný concluded.
The cutting will be checked instead of by the driver from the ATM.
The ATM service that will work from tomorrow is very simple.
Just insert the Opencard card and after payment of the cutting, it will load it above.
Electronic cards are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
In the urban lines of trains and buses from 300 to 499, the inhabitants of the municipalities of Central Bohemia take to reach the capital.
"On the additional trains in the integrated transports of Prague there are the controllers equipped with readers of the cards with which they check the temporal and zone validity," explained the Philippine ticket control mode by the Ropid organization, which sets up the times of the collective transport of Prague.
Urban buses have card readers integrated into the driver’s case.
During the climb it is therefore necessary not only to show the driver the magnetic card, but in addition you must support the Opencard at the point determined next to the box.
So the driver checks the validity of the loaded cuttings.
"If the passenger needs to check the validity of the loaded cuts, there is nothing easier than to ask the driver for this type of information," Drápal added.
Passengers who take urban buses and will not remember, when the validity of the cutting expires, can go back to the self-service ATM, where the cuttings are loaded on paper.
This will display the information on the validity of their documents on the device screen.
The Swedes wanted a referendum from the USA.
The Swedish in 1945 asked to include Šumava in the United States.
This is the result of the letter deposited in the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live under the patronage of the United States at least.
With this wish, according to what is said, some groups of Swedish Germans went to the president of the USA in 1945.
This also results from the letter stored in a private archive and now deposited in the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
The Germans of Český Krumlov ask in the letter to the US President not to allow the return of the "Šumava district" – occupied by Hitler on the basis of the agreement of Monaco – to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation and we want to be sure of the promises for American unity to come to German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," he writes in the letter signed with the words "People who hold to the fate of Šumava with all their heart."
Because, they say, the annexation to Czechoslovakia – knowing the Czech national character – gives the Germans hope only to brutality, lack of regard, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American president to hire the prototype on Šumava now and always.
"We cannot believe that without regard for the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants, you would recognize this territory as a foreign state to us, which oppresses and eradicates ethnic minorities and has contributed for nothing, for nothing, to the victory of the Allies," writes the letter.
The reason why the authors cannot sign it is the alleged fear of revenge from the "blind oppressors".
If the President of the United States doubted the Germans' conviction of Šumava, it would be sufficient to organize a referendum in the district on the will of its inhabitants to become part of the USA or to live under the leadership of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may seem naive with our knowledge of the history of the post-war, some witnesses say the expectations of the Swedish Germans at that time are appropriately described.
Although the Czech Germans had to at least understand that it would be their move from the republic, only a few of them fully admitted such a possibility.
Some expected the United States and Great Britain to negotiate some kind of autonomy for the peoples of the Sudan.
Others believed that they would simply remain in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born at Českeé Budějovice.
He was mobilized during the war as German Budějovice in the maritime power of the Baltic Sea.
When he was captured by the British at the end of the war and put in the prison camp in Holštýn, the dozens of other Czech Germans went to find him to teach him the Czech.
"These people thought that once you came home the Czech would make him comfortable," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners, who lived in Czechoslovakia the pime of war, said he was counting on the fact that on the basis of the Beneš decrees they would be moved from the Republic.
Don't think you'll pay!
The emotional campaign will attack the drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
Even so, we could define the emotional media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
The office of Minister Aleš . . . ebíček, is expected to discourage drivers from dangerous behaviour at the wheel.
The 150 million campaign will appear on television, radio, cinema, internet, but also on the flyers.
It should discourage drivers from driving fast and under the effect of alcohol on the steering wheel.
And remind him to put his belt on before he leaves.
He wants to touch the conscience especially young drivers, motocyclists, pedestrians and not last professional drivers.
What's going to happen in the spot?
Especially stories of people who will affect emotions.
And this also testifies to the "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign:
Don't think you'll pay!
The word "do not think" is capitalized on the plate.
And in a pool of blood, there's the word "pay".
This must symbolize that a person can in a moment of distraction pay with his or her life.
The spots "will scare" the spectators up to 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where images of victims of accidents can commonly be seen with dramatic scenes.
This is a promise to lower the number of accidents and deaths on the Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG Agency.
Carrot and stick to drivers
"With the drivers works the carota and stick system.
The carrot for them is, for example, when they go through red and so they save time.
The baton is the danger of the fine or the accident.
Remember the risk to the drivers," says the psychologist at the Ministry of Transport Martin Kořán of Na Homolce Hospital.
And so we need information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative publicity, believes the psychologist.
He believes the panels that warn the drivers of the danger are already less effective.
"If the fixed panel that alerts the danger has been installed, it will probably soon be confused with the environment and the drivers will no longer pay attention to it," Kořán warns.
Olmert would return almost all the occupied territories in exchange for peace
The Prime Minister of the Interim Israeli Government Ehud Olmert expressed his feelings for the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, that is, the borders of Jordan, East Jerusalem and the heights of Golan, in exchange for peace between the Palestinians and the Syrians.
So he said in the dialogue that he published Monday, the newspaper Jediot Achronot.
"We have to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all areas (occupied), if not all," Olmert said to the newspaper.
"We will have a certain percentage of these territories but the Palestinians will have to leave the same percentage (of the Israeli areas), because without this there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that the eventual return would also include East Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem, and above all he doesn't want the rupees or spyers to pass on him, as happened to one of my best friends, he will have to give up a part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in the light of the two July attacks in the city, during which some people were killed and dozens of wounded people.
According to the prime minister you will need to find "a particular solution for the Temple Mountain, the sacred and historical places," which are within the Old City. .
"He who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270 000 Arabs.
This will not work," he also stressed.
The withdrawal from the heights of Golan
Olmert has also spoken for the withdrawal of Israel from the heights of Golan, that is, according to him the essential condition to conclude this peaceful agreement with Syria.
But this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose the conclusion of peace with Syria solely on the basis of the withdrawal from Golan," he warned.
"Syrians know well what they will have to give up to get Golan's heights.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with the Hezbollahs (Sciites movement); they will have to give up their permanent support, which they offer to Hamas terrorism (Sciites movement) of Al-Qaida (the terrorist network) and Jihad (the holy war) in Iraq," said the Prime Minister.
Questions after the accident: Are Stewards illegal on buses?
The law doesn’t recognize them, you can’t walk on a long-distance bus
In the context of the tragic accident near the Italian city of Padua of the bus driver of the Student Agency, the question arose whether the pilots and passengers could move on board the bus during the race.
"If we want to abide by the laws strictly and formally, the Steward's activity is in conflict with the law of road traffic," said the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The accident last week with which a 22-year-old hostess lost her life was caused by a truck that cut the road to the bus.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver on the safer place of the bus, even though there were still two other places assigned.
But the bus can make an accident or stop abruptly even at the time of distribution of coffee or newspapers.
It depends on whether or not the bus is equipped with standing positions according to the traffic booklet.
If passengers are not approved, they shall be seated.
Student Agency's buses did not stand, confirmed it at Aktuáln.cz the director of Radim Jančura.
"We have assessed this with the Ministry and at the beginning did not allow the movement of passengers on the bus.
Then it was revoked and we concluded that passengers can use the bathroom during the race if they have the assigned place," he expressed his point of view.
The law doesn't recognize Steward.
"There is no clear legal interpretation of Steward's role – no law deals with regularizing this role."
However, no regulation prohibits the carrier from performing the services.
The law of road traffic recognizes only the term accompanying the vehicle, its rights and duties are not defined," adds the spokesman Hanzelka less clearly.
The Director of the Department of Road Traffic of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorný believes that the law takes care of this problem enough.
It depends on whether the bus has approved standing positions.
That's it," he says.
Categorizes buses in urban areas where there are standing places and the maximum limited speed, interurban with standing places with highest maximum speed and long handling without standing places with the maximum allowed speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
As on the plane, says the expert.
The expert BESIP on road safety Jaroslav Hořín does not find the fundamental problem in the Steward movement on board the bus.
"During a quiet race there are not many dangers, the situation can be compared to the air service.
Not even there is safe when a turbulence arrives and the flight attendant can blow his head."
"If the bus does a sudden braking, obviously it is worth the laws of physics.
Same as in the urban bus or on the tram.
The carrier must solve the security of the pilots by means of an internal regulation," he said and also meant that, from the point of view of the law, the problem was not solved.
Jančura is willing to suspend the services.
Student Agency is the only transport company offering steward services..
This takes about two hundred.
The Director does not consider his job dangerous even after the accident.
"As soon as I have the feeling of having to consider the steward's profession as dangerous work, I will abolish it.
Passengers can receive coffee and newspapers as they leave.
They'd also cut expenses," he says.
Asian director Alexej Litvin, who manages a fraction of lines with respect to Student Agency, has motivated the absence of the Stewards on his means as an interest in security.
"We have no hostess, we are already opposed from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end with a deadly accident," said less than a year ago Týden.cz.
An immense tragedy has occurred.
A young hostess of the Plzeň region, who had worked for the company for two years, died in the accident on the line for Naples.
A Slovenian truck probably got out of the emergency lane without using the arrow and stuck the road to the bus.
The bus driver tried to avoid it with a sudden maneuver, but hit it with the front right.
Jančura rejects the fact that the two seats reserved for the Stewarts' rest were occupied.
"It is not possible to reserve these seats in long-distance buses, they are inaccessible."
The company intends to report the driver of the truck.
The agency will not wait for the Court’s judgment to pay the damage to the girl’s family, but a financial compensation is expected from the offender.
The revision of the law?
Not in view
The revision of the law, on which a group of 30 experts from the Ministry of Transport has been working for more than a year, could lead to a clarification of the movement of Stewarts on board buses.
"They have not achieved any concrete results, however.
They are not considered by the buses, they are more concerned with the punctuation system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of the mobile phone during the driving," says expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not regard the activity of Stewart as a major threat to passenger safety," concludes spokesperson Havelka, that the control of bus safety is the responsibility of the police and security offices.
The hopes of Düsseldorf point to Frankfurt
There is no lack of words in the letter from the director of the WestLB addressed to the employees of the house.
In the letter published on Monday that could form "the capital market centre of the financial group of savings banks" through the unit meeting of the Düsseldorf banking institution with the Deka-Bank in Frankfurt.
The West LB would launch "a competent block" with lasting profits in such an enterprise.
Moreover, such a union could be a decisive boost for further links in the Länder banking sector.
So it is read, when a board of directors in difficult times wants to demonstrate the capacity of action.
Because the WestLB bereavement is still under strong pressure.
Not only on the part of the EU Commission, but also through the National Financial Supervisory Service Agency, having noted to the North Rhine regional government some time ago - Vestfalia that time is pressing for a future solution.
The ties between the Deka-Bank, which the same customers of the Savings Banks because of their investment funds already know, and the WestLB certainly has been talking about it for a while, even by Frankfurt.
He reported in late August the head of the Deka-Bank Franz Waas on the presentation of the first half of the year that a merger of the house near via Magonza with a national bank such as Helaba or West LB makes no sense.
However, the Board of Directors of the Deka, which by half is brought by the regional banks and consortiums of savings banks, has delegated the Board of Directors to conduct discussions with the West LB on joint contracts.
It could be market negotiations or parts of them.
But conversations have, as they say in business square, just started.
Della Deka-Bank, with its 3000 employees, is one of the most important ones in the business square in Frankfurt, is not mentioned the first time when it comes to consolidating the sector of savings banks.
In 2003, for a short period, Deka-Bank seemed to be able to merge with the regional bank of Renania-Palatinate and Helaba.
There was nothing about this three-way association.
As soon as the projects were published, the regional bank of Asia was opposed to the participation of Helaba.
The remaining two institutions have also proved unable to reach an agreement.
The Renania-Palatinate regional bank went to the Baden-Württemberg regional bank in Stuttgart.
And yet they have often thought of us for a merger of the Deka-Bank with regional banks.
But at the end of the day Günther Merl , president of the Helaba Board of Directors, spoke against design games to meet with his home.
Apart from this, it seems that cognition is being created, that it is necessary that the different houses of the public sector be brought closer together.
As the election of the Bavarian Parliament has passed, a meeting of the Bavarian Landesbank could first be held with that of the Baden-Württemberg.
For Helaba is not entirely good news.
If pressure increases for other mergers, the partners will be missing.
In the South there would now be the junior partner, although so far he has overcome the financial crisis far better than the houses in Monaco and Stuttgart.
The association of the Assia-Turingia savings banks that participates with 85 percent of Helaba has put the chain at the meeting with the WestLB.
It would only remain the NordLB
These geo-strategic reasonings are just an account.
On the other hand, there is also the question of how the different business models of individual houses are dealt with.
In June Merl pointed out that at the critical question, with which business model the future of regional banks would be assured, there would be no response yet from the association of German savings banks.
In the end, even the division of the West LB, which of course is not wanted.
So the letter from the board of directors expresses the will to aspire in any case to a "general solution".
The reunification of the individual parts with the Deka-Bank will work.
The second weekend of the beer festival is dedicated to Italians
For Elena it is the first time that for Luca it is the third or the fourth.
This time Elena is present at the party as a companion, and so says that everything is different.
Behind them next to the 5l barrel of the brand Kaiser stands a massive bearded and shows to about 200 travellers what are the deep tones that can produce from the throat.
Elena first gives Luca a pack and after a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here to bus parking next to Porta Nuova station, leave this evening at 23.45 four couriers with destination Monaco, Birra Festival" , arrival expected at 6.30.
Three couriers are reserved mainly for Italians, in another only Brazilian travels.
In a corner of the parking lot the South Americans are singing with the flag in their hands, having already celebrated during the night.
It is so noisy, says Marco, that it is not a thing for Italians.
Marco wearing a long coat with false fur lining and a couple of glasses with silver-plated large sticks belong to him by buses.
For 5 years they have been going to Oktoberfest, this year there are 3 tours.
The night trip, the day at the party, returns at 22,30.
Overnight would only create unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The cost of 45 Euros includes the trip, the welcome of the toast with the beer Kaiser, made according to the rules of Bavarian authenticity, the sickness fund and the German guide – Marco attended a German course in Frankfurt.
And so at night the buses leave at the turn of Brenner.
There's no beer yet.
Suddenly the silence falls on the bus, travelers sleep.
Better so, they'll still need their forces.
They stop in Bressanone and Holzkirchen, where other Italian bus tickets on the A9 motorway before Munich take a short break.
When, as expected, Marco's group arrives at 6.30 am at the parking lot near Theresienwiese, there are already about 50 more buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others come together, Marco explains for the last time the attack program.
First, put on the yellow hat.
On it on the left is written "Oktoberfest" next to the internet address of Marco's travel agency: "Knowing.it".
Second, "When opening the doors of the beer tendon means running!", quotes Marco from the early morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the seats at the bottom of the tent.
"Not in front, but we block, and not all the yellow beads sitting on the same benches, divide into the space at hand!"
The mouthpiece costs 8.25 Euros, screams Marco.
And don't forget to tip.
"Show the security service, that we behave well!
As soon as you leave the seats, they disappear!"
Third: "We meet again at 22.30 on time here! Got it?"
I'm leaving for the party.
On the way you attack as you follow the yellow beers to the trees, to the road signs and even to a billboard of a large popular Bavarian party.
You want to be ready to beat the retreat.
It is the second weekend of the festival, known as "the end of the Italian week".
The exact data do not exist, we speak of 50 thousand, who leave to cross the Alps and invade the tents, it is argued that 10% of the visitors come specifically from Italy.
The Munich police are reinforced with 7 agents from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which makes a statistics on nationalities, where Italians are first with 200 medical care in front of the English (about 60 medical care) and Austrians (about 80).
Especially loved by Italians is the tendne of the Hofbräuhaus.
1. Sleepless nights for Hypo Real Estate creditors
The German banking system is relatively stable, confirmed the Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück last week.
It is good that the politician has used the word "relative" and has also mentioned that the German banking sector is not spared from critical developments.
Because the crisis started on the weekend.
The real estate funder Hypo Real Estate, noted in DAX, obtains from a consortium of German banks a billionaire credit, in order to be able to protect itself from turbulence on the markets.
An expert in the situation told Reuters on Monday, the support credits would reach up to EUR 35 billion.
The Hypo Real Estate must only pay the interest for the requested party.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
The losses of the Depfa affiliate are at the bottom.
The state financier according to a newspaper article has been refinanced in the very short term – which is no longer possible because of the distrust on the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's reserves had decreased by 95% of the Euro 2.37 million, even the share of its own capital fell from 1.6 to 1.45.
Current income and net income from financial affairs fell to 0 compared to last year, profits from both growths and certain actions as regards the liquidation of loan provisions fell more than 70% of the 5 ML euros.
Only through higher incomes from the refund of subordinate compensation costs that come from both the restructuring of the former Depfa Group and the reimbursement of interest according to the single text of tax laws and business management for business consortia, the negative profit was quite moderate with about 16%.
The former public financier after being privatized in 1990 had been lost in speculation with commercial real estate credits, which were discovered in the Areal Bank.
Since income in the classic state financing was too low, Depfa has been engaged more in infrastructure projects and in financing joint projects of private and state investors (PIPs) and has diversified internationally.
The Hypo Real Estate must now cushion the value of the affiliate, which will have a fundamental material effect on the group's profit and loss account.
The fact is, the dividends have been deleted.
Already in 2007 they had been reduced by 2/3.
The Hypo Real Estate after Depfa's absorption is an important financier of the state and infrastructure.
It is more dependent on market refinancing between banks than other institutions, because it does not have customer trust deposits.
Due to the collapse of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago the granting of loans between banks largely dried up, because banks accumulate liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate annually needs for a part of the Depfa credit portfolio – about 50 billion. – in the short term the means of refinancing.
According to Hypo Real Estate's advice, the group's financial requirements were covered by the credit for a certain period and the company protected from the influence of the international monetary markets for the most non-functioning.
From other sources you feel, that thanks to the money the refinancing is insured until the end of 2009.
The chairman of the HRE Georg Funke Steering Committee, on the contrary, said that the HRE Group will not need the money markets soon.
The Bundesbank and the National Financial Supervisory Service (BaFin) are based on the fact that the HRE Group's trading ability is still secured.
This is expected for bank shareholders and creditors.
In view of the dynamics and imponderability of the crisis there will be no guarantee.
Funding may not be used completely.
But the opposite is not to be excluded.
After Sunday evening, the bank was about to fail, the momentary rescue failed to calm down.
The share rate falls by 75% on the 3.30 Euro.
They're pretty good at loan courses.
While the prior-debts are almost unmovable, they give in to the deferred loans.
The loans of the subsidiary Württemberg-Hypo are mainly due to be inclusive of the expiring events beyond 2009.
Before the HRE loans seemed to be a speculative alternative investment, now their value must, after the strengthening of the crisis of the banks and the institution itself, which with the importance of the Depfa has come to the crisis, be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
Unless the central banks, governments and the least damaged banks are still ready, we can count on a depreciation of the annuality by the end.
Or it goes into operation, which no one would hope for – that the financial crisis will be overcome within the next 15 months.
But with regard to the information disclosed because of partial stateizations, the almost certain probability has become a justifiable hope.
It will, above all, create for long-term investors some sleepless nights with the decision if it divides itself from their commitments.
Short-term investors may conclude the carry-over of losses for future compensatory tax payments on capital gains.
Sylvana and the Bento-Box secrets
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16 years old, on the first day of the school is expected to show up at Tachibana Highschool, the girls start redacting: German is completely "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas-in the new trading log tells of Japan.
First day of school in Japan
I was just excited.
I also had the nerve to go to school.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and I need 40 minutes by train to get to Tachibana Highschool.
I had to find her on my own, and fortunately I didn't miss her.
The beginning of the first hour of lesson does not seem to have been fixed as by us in Lower Saxony.
The students arrive flat from 8 onwards, until at 8.40 a brief interview with the professor, the so-called home room.
But before the lesson started, it was my turn to introduce myself.
I'm not the guy who speaks willingly in front of the people, in addition to a class of 40 students
Since I had not yet the school uniform, I put on an old skirt of the host mother, along with a shirt, blue socks and black leather shoes.
Dressed like this I stood in front of the chair and tried to say well: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..."- my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and celebrate in a week my birthday.
At the time, I was very happy that I had already started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class have whispered, redesigned and made signs, and I have heard the word "Kawaii".
I already knew this one from my Mangas.
It belongs to the essential lexicon of Japanese girls to survive and means "sweet, sweet."
Then I ran fast to my place.
The girl next to me grumbling, for her it was an honor to sit next to an exchange student.
The rest of the lesson time was continued quietly, but when she played the gong, I was struck in the true sense of the word.
Everything spoke disorderly and redacted and dried me with questions – then it is really difficult to understand the English of the Japanese.
In the pause everyone opened their Benedict.
My host mother also made me the basket for the Lunch- is different from the boring German sandwiches.
I had risotto with spices, sausages, cucumber salad and seaweed, fruit and a sort of rounds with meat and tofu..
I don't even know exactly what I eat in Japan.
Things look strange and have a completely new taste.
That is, everything is really good.
Maybe except the plums put under the salt, Brrr!
Bentos are not just lunch at Japanese schools.
It happens sometimes that a girl gives a Benedict made by herself, prepared quite artistically, with the hope then to meet the boy during recreation.
I read it in my Manga comics.
I'm really curious if you can find out.
"Why Japan?" they asked my friends when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Japan for a year.
I always said:
"Why does it fascinate me "
Finally, I've been reading the Mangas hot for years.
And to better understand the comics and culture they contain, sooner or later I started learning a little Japanese.
I was completely convinced to come here once.
I am also fascinated by tradition, customs and customs.
There's a lot of them here.
On the one hand, Japan is a place of technology and latest trends - on the other hand: severe, disciplined and traditional.
Since everything is organized well, I've never felt lost, even though Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen in my life."
1. Rats also have feelings
A rat or a scaffolding escape when they feel the danger. Does that mean, that they also feel the fear?
Neurologist Joseph Le Doux is convinced: many animals also have feelings.
4. But how can we find out if, when they behave in our own way, they have our own feelings?
Internet newspaper "Edge" has been published for some years by well-known scientists.
6. SPIEGEL ONLINE in a series presents chosen answers to the question: "What do you think is true, without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings or other states of consciousness, without me or anyone else being able to prove it so far, since we cannot even prove that other men have consciousness.
But in this case we must at least hope that all human brains have the same basic configuration.
9. As soon as we turn to the other species and ask questions about feeling or in general about consciousness, we enter an impracticable territory, because the base of reference does not match.
When a rat is in a dangerous situation, he does the same things that other animals do. That is he pretends to be dead, run away or attack.
People behave similarly, from which some scientists understand that there is a comparable subjective feeling.
I don't believe that.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult for us to convey our feeling toward animals.
On the one hand, the lateral prefrontal cortex is often linked to human awareness, associated circuits (this is due to its direct sharing of short memory and executive and control functions).
In man this vast area is much more developed than in other primates and it seems that among other creatures it is completely lacking.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness dependent on the prefrontal cortex, including knowledge, who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, the basis is thus accepted on the assumption that man will differ even from other primates.
Another dramatic feature should be presented in the way of speaking about man: since a large part of life is connected to the language, it is often said to be linked to consciousness.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
Although the knowledge does not depend on the language, it would influence it so that the awareness of the animal, as it is done, certainly differ greatly from the circumstances of our conscience.
That is why it is difficult to find out how consciousness can be seen in other animals.
If it is not possible to measure it as an internal and subjective thing, in analyzing it through its experience due to special hardware, their research will cause us great problems.
Most interpretations refer to the content of the conscious experience, but apart from this there is another aspect of the consciousness to which for science it would be easier to have access.
The processes of animal consciousness could be analysed without regard to their content, and this is precisely what happens in the studies on short memory of primates, in particular in the example of visualization.
So for this principle, that Christof Koch und Francis Crick follows, goes first to the neural correlations of consciousness and to the causal mechanisms: both could be identical but not necessarily.
In an interesting way, this principle also highlights the value of the prefrontal bark for the implementation of the visualization.
What, then, is meant by feelings?
I charge them to the fact that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in one of his conscious brain activities.
What we indicate as "fear" is therefore the state of mind in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, like the reactions of the body) occupys the memory of work.
In this way, feelings are closely related to the regions of the bark, which characterize the primates and in particular the human being.
With the talking nature we create subtle nuances of feeling, because with the help of words and grammar we can distinguish and categorize situations, to describe them to others.
In comparison to this Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that feelings result from more primitive activities of the body regions of the sensations of the bark and the cephal palace, similar to Jack Pankseep, who nevertheless concentrated more on paleocephalus.
Since this network in the course of human evolution has not changed much, this could absolutely be part of the feelings extended to the species.
On a purely theoretical level, I cannot contradict it, but I believe it to be unspeakable.
Pankseep argues that what for rats and human beings appears as fear, is probably so felt in both cases: but how could it occur, if rats and human beings try the same thing when they behave in a similar way?
Does a scarf in the event of danger run away as if he also felt fear?
In my eyes, the mere resemblance of behavior cannot yet demonstrate any vital similarity.
That is, neural confrontation continues to be helpful: rats and human beings have similar paleoencephals, scarafages not even a brain.
But is paleoencephal responsible for feelings?
And when we can even prove it for human beings: how would we want to prove it on rats?
I think rats and other mammals, perhaps even insects (who knows?), have feelings.
But I didn't know how to prove it.
And since their feelings are fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness is based on specific circuits and language), I prefer to study emotional behavior rather than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, there is progress here at the neural level, provided that we give up the same procedure on rats and men.
As I don't do language and consciousness research in rats, so I don't do it on their emotions, I don't even know if they exist.
This may be considered shortsighted, but I prefer to take steps forward, rather than continuously crash against a wall.
I'm for the point an emotional practical.
The President of UEFA Platini: referral for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik said that the preparations will soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees the Uefa's decision in Bordeaux as a demonstration of trust in Ukraine and its ability to organize Europe with Poland," said Wasjunik.
"But this is not an amnesty for our country.
The job just started and there's still a lot to do in both countries"
Both the host countries zoppiche in the roadmap for the construction or reconstruction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports.
Eventually the number of stages to be used for Europe will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste more time.
We now have to work with the highest speed," said the President of the Ukrainian association Grigorij Surkis.
"the UEFA will keep an eye on us"
An even more radical step has been taken in Poland.
After many scandals the leadership of the Polish association PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of the Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There would be "the serious danger that PZPN is not able to operate according to the rules," Drzewiecki told the Polish information agency PAP.
"In a letter we assured UEFA President Michel Platini that the preparation for the 2012 EM will not suffer."
Many of the first division exponents only in the past season were condemned for manipulation, at the end they had to postpone to the last moment the beginning of the League.
Dennis Quaid reproached
He wanted to promote a new film, he talked about the private and now he has grain with the ex: the star of Hollywood Meg Ryan has declared his former Dennis Quaid adultery.
He foams of anger and rivets.
The war of the Roses was delayed for the former couple of married Meg Ryan und Dennis Quaid: seven years after their separation the two Hollywood actors are now arguing with each other a bad argument - in public.
Meg Ryan in an interview with the American magazine InStyle last week for the first time expressed himself on the reasons for the failure of marriage: "Dennis has long been unfaithful to me, and this has been very painful."
The extent of the betrayals you would have known only after the separation.
The occasion for the "breathing of the soul" was Ryan's work with the press for his new film "The Women" – the story of an adultery is told.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his being publicly declared as an adulterer has been a clear failure: it would be "unheard", said the fifty-four to the "New York Daily News", that "Meg for the last time repeats and reworks the history of our relationship".
It would also be "degreeful" that at Jack, the sixteen-year-old son who had together, again "will publicly remember the pain and subvertment, which a separation means for every child."
While Ryan from the separation lives alone, Quaid is remarried and will soon become father of twins.
And therefore his judgments are closed with the arrow: "My life in any case goes on.
I find myself lucky to have a wonderful family to which everything goes for the best."
They cut the prices for air tickets and hotels
In the first half of 2008 flights and overnights in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would be up to 50% cheaper.
Hotel flights and overnights have become more convenient again - this is the result of a study by the financial provider and American Express travel.
The company analysed its booking data for the first half of the year 2008 and after an increase in prices in the first quarter observed an apparent decrease in the second quarter.
After prices on the hotel market have increased for years, overnights in many places have already fallen in price.
From January to March prices rise in 41 of the 48 European cities still examined on average around 6.9 compared to 2007
However, from April to June prices were already 3,6 % lower than in the previous year.
The most obvious trend would have been in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay 30 to 37% less than a year before..
The American Express sees as the reason for this the dollar's weak price, which would lead to a "single desire to travel American tourists"
Financial centres such as Frankfurt and London would also be affected by the recession of hotel prices in a stronger way than industrial centres such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger
In the Norwegian city the prices of hotels with an increase of 26.3% hold even the record in Europe
As far as flight prices are concerned, the trend in the first quarter is still as follows:
Due to the increase in kerosene, passengers in the Economy Class had to pay on average 7.1% compared to 2007, long-range fuel intensive flights would be up to 29.2% higher
From April to June the prices of the Economy Class air tickets fell by an average of 12.5% compared to the previous quarter, in the first class and in the Business, the price changes were, however, much weaker.
In Germany prices fell even more sharply than in other European countries:
From January to March prices rose by 11,9 %, in the second quarter they fell by 23,6 %.
As for the German domestic flights according to the study, prices have even halved.
The reason for the collapse of prices would, on the one hand, be lower economic growth, explains the company.
The demand in many segments of the air travel market has broken down.
On the other hand, there would be an agreement on open skies, which liberalises air traffic between the USA and Europe, an increased pressure on competition.
A sign of the critical situation would be the abolition of non-profit items at the Airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 they would have declared bankruptcy – only in Europe were 24 airlines.
HSV beats Gladbach for 1 to 0
With a goal and simple methods, Hamburg's VS becomes a capitalist.
At the Borussia Luhukay still can't find a group of 11 that works.
Here Kristoffer Klein worsens the landing of luck for the national player Marko Marin.
Gladbach's player first got into play late and failed with a shot on the cross
His message was carefully formulated, passed on to his lips convincingly.
He knew he was absolutely right.
"We need the second goal," exclaimed Hermann Rieger in the Hamburg cabin corridor.
It had not happened much in the catacombs, the game break was over and most of it sat back in its place.
Rieger has been a physical therapist for almost 3 decades of HSV, enjoys an even greater estimate of some old players.
And so his speech also found listening in the high spheres.
The assistant coach Cornelius Jol drowned and raised the thumb in approval.
Cornelius is the brother of the head coach of Hamburg Martin Jol.
His order must have sounded similar: here is the second goal!
The change of position did not occur.
"Today it wasn't all nice to see," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt would also have "wanted more relaxed".
For the 1 to zero Hamburg players, they have to thank the head shot of Mladen Petric (11) and the fact that many weak players in Gladbach have not been able to hurt the weak players in Hamburg.
"It was a dirty victory," said Martin Jol.
The SV of Hamburg this Monday will be 121 years old.
The spectators celebrated earlier, in the afternoon of Saturday, themselves, the blue sky on the arena and the flashing ranking on the video screen, which has legitimized their sports society as before the class.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"we're able to make things right," said Marcell Jansen.
It has the presentation, that the provisional certificate from the table is more indicative of the unforeseeable of the championship than of the dominance of its HSV.
The team with its new arrivals hired late – the Brazilian Neves und Silva, the defender of the petric gate as well as Jansen blown to the FC Bayern – finds itself slowly, but has not yet managed to shine.
"We need more atmosphere and more Dribbling," relaunchs Jol.
After the vote was defeated
Wall Street circulates fear.

Dark matter influences the flight of space probes
For years a mysterious phenomenon has created perplexity among scientists: dark matter influences the speed of space probes during the so-called Swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einsteins' general theory of relativity might not be entirely accurate.
The Ulysses space probe flew through space for almost 18 years.
Because of the pipes of the fuel they freeze fast now there is death by freezing on her.
Among scientists for years, a mysterious phenomenon creates a breakdown – the anomaly of / or Swing-by
Swing-by is a flight maneuver of space probes, with which they get additional thrust/pinning/oscillation in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example of Earth.
So probes can save a lot of fuel.
The Euro-American search probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical expedition as well as the Ulysses solar probe.
What has amazed scholars for years already: rockets do not behave completely as expected according to the law on gravity.
On the contrary, there are irregularities in speed.
The probes suddenly become faster or slower.
So far the physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
The year re-marked Swing-by's anomaly.
Some experts fear that perhaps even the general theory of the relativity of Albert Einstein, which describes the force of attraction of matter with a curvature of space, might not be entirely accurate.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study firmly believes that before Einstein was wrong, and tries to explain Swing-by's anomaly through the so-called dark matter that astronomers have sighted in the cosmos.
"Responsible for anomaly could be the dark matter that could also be very close to Earth," he writes.
Of the existence of dark matter, space scholars have only known about 10 years.
She obviously leaves a force of attraction, whose effect on the other heavenly bodies is revealed.
She herself is completely invisible, that is, she neither sends nor reflects any electromagnetic radiation of sort, especially no visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, dark matter constitutes at least a good fifth of the entire mass of the cosmos.
The tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After 10 days in the hands of their kidnappers the tourists kidnapped in Egypt would be free again, as confirmed by the Italian foreign minister.
Sudanese kidnappers had requested several million euros of ransom.
In a shooting before release 6 kidnappers were killed.
Five Germans were kidnapped in southern Egypt.
The negotiations for the ransom are already under way.
Germans are always in the sight of kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are undoubtedly free.
This has been reported in agreement with Egyptian state television, Arab radio station Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the Italian television broadcaster Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages have been released
We are examining their health," Frattini said.
The 5 Germans, 5 Italians and one Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian escorts would be in good health and safety, reported Egyptian state television.
The 19 components of an expedition in the desert are already on the way to Cairo.
There is still little clarity on the backstage of a shooting that took place before the hostages were released: therefore the kidnappers after the indications of an Egyptian security officer would have been ready for the conclusion of the kidnapping, before the Sudanese army had killed 6 of them in surprise.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed for a ransom," said the official.
It would still be "just try to take the hostages into delivery", when suddenly "this surprise" arrived.
Sudanese soldiers on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt killed 6 of their kidnappers by gunfire and captured 2 of them.
The kidnappers had claimed from Germany a ransom of €6 million; the money should have been delivered by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom" referred to a German intermediary, the release of the hostages would have delayed, because the kidnappers feared for their own safety.
According to the report the kidnappers wanted to release the women hostage after the ransom was paid.
The men would have been held back until the kidnappers had had had a secure escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to take a position on the report .
The abuse of the patriot "brought suicide"
Years of abuse by the stepfather led a woman to kill herself, declared a court.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, was in prison for 6 years after he admitted eight cases of sexual assault.
Truro Crown Court learned that he regularly bothered his daughter Stephanie Randle, when she was between the ages of five and seven.
Trerise wrote in a confessional note: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court learned that Miss Randle had killed herself in her house in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she was a child and lived in Coventry, Trerise bothered her and bandaged her before having sex, while the mother was out working in a pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in Cornwall.
Her daughter-in-law went to Plymouth.
But the court learned that Mrs. Randle, who had spent a lot of time as a volunteer at the National Trust, was tormented by the abuses that caused her.
In 2006, Public Minister Ramsey Quaife told the court that Ms. Randle's friends, who had been a very good surfer and cyclist, were "emotionally dead," and who had "bitten with life".
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
She is thought to have been killed suffocating with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle comforted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a letter of confession that ended: "The ligavo and the bandage".
"I didn't sexually harass her.
I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "He is an extremely strange fetishist, and for his victim he must have been terrifying, especially when he was only seven years old.
"This unfortunate saga ends with the victim who takes his life.
Even harder is the fact that if he hadn't, it would have been difficult for the facts to end before the court."
I know the effects Stephanie's father and mother describe having had on their daughter these years.
"Others were clearly likely that she was a promising and happy young man of success."
The officer who lost the data will be punished.
The Cabinet Officer who left the top secret documents on a train in June must be charged by the Official Secrets Act, has learned the BBC.
The man was transferred from the Ministry of Defense when he left two highly classified documents on the train to Waterloo.
The documents were passed to the BBC before they were delivered to the police.
It is the least delicate of the accusations made under this law and there is nothing that suggests a criminal intent.
BBC defense correspondent Frank Gardner said the movement would come as a surprise to many of the administration.
"They thought this was treated internally to the Mod and the Cabinet Office," he said.
The employee, who cannot be appointed, is about to be charged under Section 8.1 of the Act, the clause concerning the protection of information.
The Crown Prosecution Service recommended that the officer must be accused by the Metropolitan Police because of the highly sensitive nature of his work.
The lost documents contained assessments of al-Qaeda and the capabilities of Iraq's security forces.
He was informed of the decision Monday morning and was taken away from his home and taken to a hidden place.
Construction companies face the B&B account
English construction companies could face an account of over £80 thousand after the Bradford & Bingley bank rescue.
The government gave 14 billion pounds to protect the deposits of 2.6 million Bradford & Bingley savers.
The interest on that loan will be paid by all companies that take the savings money, including the 59 construction companies.
The Director General of Building Companies Association (BSA) Adrian Coles said it is "irritating" that companies and their members have to pay.
The loan of 14 billion pounds will eventually be repaid when the loans of Bradford & Bingley will be redeemed.
But the interest that will mature in the meantime will be paid every year to the 700 financial companies that take deposits. But the interest that will mature in the meantime will be charged every year to the 700 financial companies that accept deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies would be included in that number.
It is annoying that those institutions that have acted prudently are now called to pay part of the account of those institutions that have been much less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company had to pay in proportion to the deposits it had, and that the companies among them had to pay 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that the interest on the loan will amount to £450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find £81 million to pay for the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, director general of the construction company association, told the BBC that he thinks he's unfair.
"It is irritating that those institutions that have acted prudently in the house-rearing market are now called to pay part of the account of those institutions that have been much less prudent."
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the documentation began in 1945.
"We need to examine all aspects in the coming weeks to see what options there are to protect construction societies and their members from what could be a significant account," Mr Cole added.
The interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010 the interest of an entire year will be due and this could be almost twice higher.
Since construction companies are mutual organisations without shareholders, their members end up paying the account through higher rates or lower interest rates on savings accounts.
The milk goes up to 5 penny per liter
People in Jersey are facing the fact that they have to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that there will be an increase in wholesale prices of its milk for an extra five-pence per litre from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after an increase of two pennies in February, and comes after a research carried out by a consulting company.
Retail sellers must decide for themselves whether they want to download the price increase on their customers.
(DANILO) Before the increase in February, the wholesale price changed for the last time in 2002.
Rejected bail to former Prime Minister of Bangladesh
A court in Bangladesh refused a bail request from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which means that you could be arrested when you return to the country.
His lawyers said that the court refused to grant him a bail for cutting out 50 million taka ($729,700) to a businessman when he was a member of parliament
The case is one of many accusations of corruption against you.
The long-standing political rival of Sheikh Hasina, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail at the beginning of the month.
The return to Bangladesh of Sheikh Hasina is scheduled for the next few weeks but its party, Awami League, has asked that the temporary government of the country supported by the military give it first total freedom.
Correspondents say that while you were going abroad for medical treatment on the word, it is not clear according to the terms of your release, if you can remain free when you return to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say he will call the Supreme Court against the order of the High Court.
"The high court has refused the bail request for Sheikh Hasina saying that she can't have the security since she's already abroad on the word for medical care," says his lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We shall file an appeal against the order of the High Court."
His lawyers explain that he needs security to return to the country from abroad to prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after 17 October, said a senior leader of the Awami League party on Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the government flanked by the military force took power, but was released in June, to go abroad to receive medical care.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against themselves.
Fear for Afghan Anti-Polio Campaign
Almost 200,000 children in Afghanistan are missing from the recent campaign of immunisation due to violence related to the Taliban, says the UN.
The UN has carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces last week.
But it is said that it cannot reach children in the Helmand and Kandahar parts in the south for security reasons.
One UN spokesman said that this is despite the Taliban's promises that they would not attack or hinder thousands of staff carrying the vaccinations.
BSkyB loses legal battle with ITV
BSkyB lost its legal battle with the Competition Commission's decision to force the company to reduce its participation in rival ITV TV station.
BSkyB was told by the competition appeal court to cut its ITV shares from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
Previously, the commission had said that BSkyB's participation hindered competition and allowed an unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought participation in 2006 in an agreement that actually blocked NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trading reported that the acquisition of BSkyB's participation in ITV raises doubts about ITV's independence, making the Competition Commission launch an investigation.
Virgin's head, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the regulator of Ofcom opposed the purchase.
BSkyB argued that forcing it to reduce ITV stake was unreasonable and a disproportionate remedy - particularly as BSkyB had said it would surrender it voting rights.
New investigation into the case of the US prosecutor
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a special Public Ministry to examine the dismissal of nine U.S. lawyers in 2006.
The operation took place when a case report by the Inspector General of the Department of Justice criticised the actions of the administrative officers.
The report was critical of the White House, the legislators and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was made clear from the fear that the prosecutors were removed for political reasons.
The special public ministry Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officers questioned during the investigation lied to investigators in an attempt to hinder justice.
"Series accused of potentially criminal behaviour have not been fully investigated or corrected," said Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
The assignment of a special public ministry with the power to force witnesses to testify was one of the main recommendations.
The dispute began when nine U.S. prosecutors were removed from their positions by the Justice Department in December 2006.
At that time, the department said the lawyers had been fired for excavating performance.
But it later appeared that the lawyers who were dismissed had not been assessed more than many other colleagues, leading many observers to conclude that the dismissal had been motivated by politics.
Some of the prosecutors had been involved in judicial action against high-profile Republican members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate the accusation of fraud against democratic voters.
American prosecutors investigate and bring cases to court on behalf of the government.
They can be fired at any time, but they cannot be fired for political reasons.
The then head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, was in the storm for the dismissals, and finally reassessed his position.
A number of other officers in the Justice Department fired themselves.
(The Inspector General's report was very critical of Mr Gonzales' role in the case, saying that he had primary responsibility for dismissals, which he had abdicated to his leadership role and had been extraordinarily detached during the process.
Other officers, including Bush Karl Rove's previous senior assistant, were criticized for not collaborating with the investigations.
The epic of the Meat Loaf will be celebrated
The rock star Meat Loaf is about to be honored at Q Awards for its epic ink Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will withdraw his special gold prize at next week's ceremony in London, said he was "honored" to gain recognition.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the song track of the 1977 Meat Loaf album.
The Coldplay will lead the nominations for this year's prizes, being on the list of the nominated in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of the magazine Q, said: "There are some songs that transcend things like time and gender, and Bat Out Of Hell is undoubtedly one of those."
The song, composed of Jim Steinman, required a strong vocality that was provided by the Meat Loaf.
It was opened with an instrument section that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was realized as a single in the UK in 1979 and reached the 15th place.
But the album of Meat Loaf Bat Out Of Hell remained almost nine years in class and came to sell more than 40 million copies in the world.
Meat Loaf - the real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered from health problems in recent years, including an intervention for an irregular heartbeat in 2003 after having collapsed on stage.
In 2007, acute larynx forced him to cancel the concerts.
He later emerged that he had a lice on a vocal cord.
Dark city streets, often forgotten and maybe soon for sale
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards, roads and other crossings, some famous, others merely of use.
But also many veteran taxi drivers and residents for a long time find it difficult to give the position of Extra Place, especially because they have never heard of it.
The tiny road is in the East Village and goes north from the First Street – without making the Second Street – between Bowery and the Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, it looks more like a dusty alley than an active traffic.
There are no road signs.
It's virtually impossible to see it on a normal athlete.
The road must, however, have admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the real estate company of luxury buildings recently built on the First Street.
You want to reopen Extra Place and create a cleaner passage for shops and boutiques that should open in new buildings.
Other admirers include long-standing neighbors who say that they were hit by the truncated road simply because it was one of the last remains of the gentlemanly quarter of the past.
But the department of preservation and development of the city, which has the control of the roads, has no interest in keeping it.
During a meeting of the Committee for the Use of Land of the Municipal Commission of the District representatives of the city agency and Avalon Bay outlined a proposal for the real estate company to buy the streets.
But the committee prefers that the road stay in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new plan to introduce next month, says Susan Stetzer, the director of the Community Board District 3.
"There is very little space left to the property of the city, and we would like the city to continue to own Extra Place," he said.
"We might be proposing to fix it and manage it, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want to guarantee public access."
Avalon Bay many months ago announced that he would like to reopen the little road and install seating positions, including some to use for a coffee at which the real estate company hopes to rent space.
The idea that Avalon Bay would buy the road was made public for the first time at this month's meeting.
Michele de Milly, a spokesperson from Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the road, it doesn't necessarily mean that it wants to own it.
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renew this erratic alley and turn it into a public amenity," he said, adding that the city suggested the sale.
Seth Donlin, a spokesperson for Preservation Accommodations, said that it was in fact the city's desire to sell the road and pointed out that the agency's purpose was to develop the property rather than administer it.
In comparison to its most colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left a light historical footprint.
Some believe it was named in 1802, when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was divided between his many children and the narrow strip of land was not claimed.
The back door of CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opened on Extra Place, and the street is perhaps better known as the set for the cover photo of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia."
"The land was splendid," said Danny Fields, Ramones' manager, who took the photo in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, clothing brands and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves, ropes."
Some residents, including some bloggers who write "gentrification" of the East Village, opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, implying that the public property piece, as it is, should remain public.
Others praised Extra Place as a rarity – a city fragment almost for nothing changed that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who has a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled, "The Book of Complaints: A somewhat nostalgic look at the dying city"), published part of a speech on the history of the city that appeared on The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is an acute unexited, dark street, also day-round and delimited doors of rusty iron warehouses and windows with sarcasms, with old newspapers of weeks flying along the bottoms."
With a few exceptions, the road seemed almost the same as a recent evening.
A rat ran agilely through the back of the road near a door leading into the CBGB, which is now the site of an aristocratic dress shop.
On the walls there were scratches and a bottle of 22 ounces empty beer lying near a group of fresh abandoned newspapers.
A few passers-by have said that they rarely thought of Extra Place but suggest that they would need to be a little beautified.
Mr Fields, for his part, said that he also thinks some people underestimate the attractiveness of the road in its present state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "were in black, dirty, and disgusting places."
Bilingual debate: immersion in English
In this educational point, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the position of candidates on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, senior member in California's studies and senior director of educational studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "Not Good How You Think: Because the middle class needs to choose a school."
Really attracting Spanish voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama's educational projects are a significant example.
Mr Obama's campaign notes that, "African-American and Latin students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students," which is true.
In order to combat these shortcomings in achieving the goals, Obama's educational plan specifically supports, among other things, "transient bilingual education" for English students.
Yet, the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes teaching in language classes other than English, does not take into account his interest in filling learning gaps.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in the eastern county of Los Angeles.
The students of the school are mostly Hispanic and low-income.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have recently arrived, are studying English.
But among fourth-school students, a surprising 100 percent of students did the top-level test in the 2008 state math exam.
An equally surprising 93 percent of fourth-school students did the expert level test on English-language-art.
This incredible result has been achieved using a different ingredient from that preferred by Mr. Obama.
Sixth Street emphasizes transparency and exercise, constant assessment of skills and an "no excuse" attitude.
Furthermore, and it is here that Mr Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, Director of Sixth Street, the school's obstructive approach to English students is "full immersion."
The use of English emphasizes the almost exclusive use of English in the context of education.
Mrs. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, said to me, "we had a great success with a student just from Mexico and if you were in class 12 months later you wouldn't be able to identify what it was."
"It works," he observed, "for us it works."
Would Obama take a model school like Sixth Street Prep to replicate it in other schools with a Spanish majority and with English students?
The results achieved by the school make the answer to that very easy question, but education policy in its own party (the National Education Associations is a long-standing supporter of bilingual education) and its own continuing support for bilingual education hinders the prediction of Mr. Obama's response.
While he agrees that immigrants should study English, Obama recently made the issue trivial when he said that people should stop worrying about "only-English" legislation.
Instead, he said, "You must be sure that your children are able to speak Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close these gaps, he should carefully consider the educational models that work rather than despise them or banalize them.
Oil falls sharply and renews economic fear
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday because of the concerns that even the US rescue plan for financial markets may not be able to raise the economy.
The futures of the crude fell from 7% to $99.80 per barrel at the New York Stock Exchange in the morning operations.
Prices have lost more than $20 per barrel since last Monday.
In the last two weeks, the raw materials markets have been shaken by the financial turmoil of Wall Street, and by a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a peak of $145.26 at the barrel in June, prices fell to almost $90 at the barrel at the beginning of this month, before coming up again, on the background of a tremendous uncertainty in financial markets.
Anxiety influenced investors again on Monday even after Congressional leaders said they had reached an agreement at the weekend about the rescue plan, the largest in history.
The news was obscured by fresh concerns that the financial crisis was far from over.
In the last episode of the progressive merger, Citigroup will include the banking operations of Wachovia Corporation, said the government on Monday.
At the same time the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partly nationalized the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Barclays Capital analysts said that the frantic weekend negotiations had led to a rescue agreement "they seem to have failed to revive the feeling of the market.
As the economic situation worsens, demand for raw materials, including oil, is expected to calm down.
"The perspective for global equity, interest rates and exchange rate markets has become uncertain," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
"We believe that raw materials will not be able to escape the infection.
From a raw materials perspective our most pressing concern is to what extent the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China."
Bank analysts have lowered their expectations for the next year while the consumption of home oil due to the slowdown in economic growth, reducing forecasts on the price of oil and gas by about 20% in 2009.
The exploit in the second quarter marks a team record.
After spending more time than anyone with the Jets uniform in the last eight and more seasons, the defender Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything.
Then he watched the second quarter of Sunday, when the Jets turned a game without points to a summit.
"Never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
The second fourth began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had equaled the greyness of the threatening clouds that overlaid them with a cool game.
Then the Brett Favre quarterback found Lavernues Coles for a 12 yard touchdown, providing the perfect signal for an afternoon in which their growing tune made a giant step forward.
Favre found Coles for two other touchdowns in the fourth, including one when a cornerback fell and another with 10 seconds left at the end of the first time.
"I didn't get out of my path," said Favre of all the passages that came to Coles.
He's a great player.
Our communication was great, despite what people might think."
While Favre and Coles were playing catch games, the defense severely hit Cardinals Kurt Warner's quarterback.
The cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a vague launch and relaunched it for 32 yards in a touchdown.
Security Eric Smith has planned another step and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens forces a Warner smoker.
The last shifter, the smoker forced by Bowens, could have been the most remarkable.
The Cardinals took advantage of that ball possession, with 10 seconds left, and after the Jets had taken the ball with 10 minutes left, Jay Feely kicked a 20-yard goal, for an advantage of 34 to 0.
It was more than the Jets ever scored in a quarter.
When he was asked to describe his madness, the Jet coach Eric Mangini said, "The second or third quarter?"
When he was told both - the Jets granted 21 unanswered points in the third fourth - Mangini said, "I can tell you that I liked the second quarter more than the third one."
There's been a lot of points in a little bit of time."
Rested Gebrselassie surpasses his world record
Haile Gebrselasie from Ethiopia showed again because many consider him the best marathon ever, breaking his own world record at the Berlin marathon Sunday and becoming the first person to run a race of 26.2 miles under 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a win on the race favorablely flat at 2:03:59, Gebrselassie sends for 27 seconds his previous score of 2:03:26, run last year in Berlin.
At 35 years of age, Gebrselassie sets up the 26th world record of such an amazing career that it has produced a world championship or a world record at every distance from the metric mile to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie jumped the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing - perhaps too alarmingly, in retrospect - that air pollution would have worsened its asthma problems.
Instead, he decided to run to Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at departure, 55 degrees on arrival - Gebrselassie has won Sunday with a hot average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
As soon as half of the founders such as Gebrselasie and Paul Tergat of Kenya went to long distances, the marathon record fell more than two minutes ago, since Ronaldo from Costa del Brazil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After the Sunday victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that two weeks ago he had the cramps at the pulppaks and he missed a week of training.
Clearly, rest left him fresh, not rusty.
"I'm so happy," Gebrselassie told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started over a week ago, and I had some doubts today, but in the end everything went well."
He was a bit criticized - especially in Kenya, the East African rival of Ethiopia - for having excessively orchestrated his races, generally avoiding many of the world's best marathon stars, counting on aprepist as if it were a background race, and putting the world's records above the sense of competition.
But these criticisms rarely diminish the size of Gebreslasie's skills as a marathon.
With the passage of four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie reached the midway point at 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, competed in Gebrselasie after the apripists disappeared.
Just over three miles from the arrival, Gebrselassie made an impenñada finale to separate from Kwambai, which ended in 2:05:36, improving his best personal time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi arrived third at 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, native of Kazakhstan who is now a German town, has completed a remarkable year winning at 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time ever.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko was a surprise winner of the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
You lost the Beijing Games with what is described as a bad accident, but you are healed to win in Berlin, making your best personal time of almost five minutes in the third marathon that has run.
She ran a race doing well in her calculations, letting a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners leave with a great detachment, taking them back after about 18 miles and a half.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia arrived second in 2:21.31, while Helena Kiprop from Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
In a separate city, pride and processes of a black life
Hidden in the theme park extended on the suburbs of Orlando, a few miles from the splendor, noise, enormous, lies the quiet city where pride and complications of African-American experience enter into life.
Eatonville, the first black city incorporated into the country and home of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as described in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet camps, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, plenty of guava, two schools and no prison."
Now it is a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Eatonville Festival to show their respect for Hurston, Harlem Renaissance's most famous writer.
Yet in many ways, the city that he described - and that makes tourists stop including it in the tourist guide of Florida produced by the Depression-era Federal Writers' Project - remains a separate place.
It is so independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s, when hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted to share their thoughts with the white man, who "knowing so little of us, doesn't know what is being lost."
Even now, in a year where a designated black presidential officer, Senator Barack Obama, was called for an opening speech on the race, many here remain suspicious of the outsider's gaze.
"We are very careful about how our story is told," said Hortense Jones, 59, a lifetime resident and member of the oldest church in the city.
"It has to be fair."
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and difficulty.
It is both a historical model of black seizure and a community of almost 2,400 where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a literary centre but also an example in the shadow of the oaks of the rural culture of the South Blacks - sometimes disliked, sometimes rewarded - born of American slavery.
Not surprisingly, residents here are both proud and protective.
And Eatonville's image concern really started with Zora, whom everybody here calls Hurston.
She introduced the world to her hometown through sincere, dialect-rich books, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs of Florida's guide transformed the city, just outside the Route 17, a road that runs through the often forgotten center of Florida within a scenario of black history and human drama
Low as a crab in both life and literature, hurston brought the readers into the store owned by Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then deviated into more private areas.
"Out of the road to the left," he wrote, "is the modern public school, brown with white finishes, with its well-preserved gardens and courtyards, to which Howard Miller always looked, thinking he could just read and write."
She also mentioned widow's new husband Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells all kinds of drinks and anything that fits in the passage rooms."
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston connected Eatonville with self-government but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
This clearly wasn't Fodor's.
In fact, it was not a portrait that everyone appreciated.
"I kept telling you what it was like," said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of Johnson's girls that hurston immortalize her quoting men who sing gross songs about their beauty.
He adds: "Some people don't like it."
Hurston is still remembered here as a lively eccentric who often returned from his family transferred to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77 years old, recalls that when Hurston fell in the city, he usually arrived without notice in a triumphant Chevrolt, smoking and wearing pants in a city that even today boasts dignified clothing.
Many people were fascinated, says Mr. Franklin, while others were breathing.
"People were always very happy to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But, he added, kneeling on his chair on the back patio over Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "he never stayed for a long time".
When Hurston died in 1960, he was poor and his books were out of print.
Along with the rest of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten it.
Although once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at the Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an untagged tomb in Fort Pierce, Fla., where she had lived.
In Eatonville, there were no big commemorative ceremonies, and no big conference.
"I don't think they understand his contribution to the world or his legacy to all," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a biography of Hurston published in 2003.
A change took place in the 1980s.
Orange County officials wanted to place a five-course highway across the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the main two-course road.
The expansion of Orlando has already pushed La Interstate 4 through the western border of the city.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult time in his history.
Forced integration, in addition to other things, had brought an end to its idyllic isolation of the community
In the 1950s, the battle on racial mixing brought hatred on the door of the community.
"During that time, a group of white boys came and threw oranges and things to the people sitting on the side," said Mr. Franklin.
"We actually had a girl who was killed once.
They threw a bribe out of a car."
In a letter from 1955 to The Orlando Sentinel, hurston made the Supreme Court a request for forced integration, defining his decision in Brown against the school office "an insult rather than an honour for my race".
The residents now say that the disintegration of schools, despite having been positive in some respects, is disappointing the cohesion of Eatonville and jeopardises the confidence of its young people.
"The black children were used to being hugged - I remember this - hugged your teacher in the morning, hug your teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, Ella Dinkins' daughter and Executive Director of Preserve the Eatonville Community, a non-profit group.
This lasted, he added, until the teachers and students came from the same place.
"You didn't embrace your white teacher because your white teacher...- I mean, there's a cultural division there," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Civil rights, however, helped and created space for many other Zora Neale Hurstons - black writer, actress and artist who overcome prejudices, as she did, with cheerful self-confidence and lines such as: "How can some deny themselves the pleasure of my company!
I can't really understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker began a long walk for the Hurston untagged tomb and began to fight for the resurrection of her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography on Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway struck the shelves of the bookstores, reintroducing it into the American canon.
The highway project arrived just as his most famous daughter had caught the lights of the wreck again.
And this time, the old neighbors of Hurston saw her as a savior.
The community began to design in 1988 a festival dedicated to hurston to show what could ruin the state with its highway.
Thousands of fans came to the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return for the commemoration.
Many years later, the state pulled back from its road project.
"The five lanes of the risen highway brought what would be said the high speed, a real pride for the city," said Ms. Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd puts it in a simpler way: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory on the highway project helped change the image the city has of itself.
Those from outside cities like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started to come to church here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and residents began to re-evaluate the past.
Eatonville joined the public record in 1998.
A new one-storey library (called hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on a patented and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly of Florida: only six miles from the center of Orlando, can give the feeling of a secondary road under the summer rain, small as when it was founded with only 27 black families in the 1980s.
(It's 90 percent black today.)
The outsiders who come to search for Eatonville's story, for its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
A permit requested in advance is required for most interviews, to some things - like the murals on Eatonville's oldest church, painted by a white man, who show black men in the fields - do not have permission to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Ms. Jones, a fat teacher, with a weakness for bright red, still fears that their island community will be misunderstood.
Yet, as the Hudson festival expanded, a high level of citizen pride also emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville with Hurston saw his entire race: beautiful, problems and everything, not better, nor worse and proud, creative, great worker, foolish and confused like other races and ethnic groups in America.
It is sincere civic affection what can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew Edwin Harvey, 18, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or the Police Department, who said he might need help.
And even those younger, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Many people, if they just got in here, will think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others," said Alondra Kenon after the Mass on a recent Sunday.
"But if you really stop and take a moment to look at history, it's really a pretty city."
Here in New York we all talk fluently about finance
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the newspaper stalls and the huge TV screens of Times Square, they wouldn't notice that they were looking at the cyclone.
They would never guess that glass offices, nested in water above their heads, the bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York daily live the worst "sudden day in office" since the collapse of 1929.
The factors shake metal carts for the the through the sidewalks, carrying muffin trays for breakfast meetings.
Latin Americans drag their feet between condominiums carrying, like human mules, 50 and broken shirts hanging on a stick on their shoulders.
Employees are still waiting in line for their morning bagel at the food carts on the sidewalks, and it is still impossible to take a yellow taxi between 16 and 19 of a working day.
It did not seem that there was a real crisis, until, with all the speech of ruin and sadness, I decided to open a new savings booklet on Thursday afternoon.
Although I had planned the matter so that it would coincide with the late afternoon break at my branch of JP Morgan Chase, a queue of about twenty was already waiting in line.
Not in front of the cashier's door, to withdraw money or make deposits, but in front of the customer service door, where old customers order cheques, tourists ask directions for the big Macy warehouse and new customers start counting.
Many of those who are in front of me, I would then learn from Starr, my "trust banker", were in line for my same reason.
Unlike me, however, they have already taken savings from smaller banks from places where commuters, such as those from New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They took the money from the so-called Thrifts (a little like a construction company), credit cooperatives and types of city savings banks whose subsidiaries operate only within a state, and say they treat customers as family members.
In the past few years, 15 of these banks have failed.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, was subject to the controlled administration, and while the New Yorkers headed home for the weekend one Friday afternoon, another bank, Wachovia, with savings deposits of $440 billion, was looking for a buyer who saved it.
The employees and merchants who were in front of me, frightened by another collapse, were moving their money to a bank perceived as a safe port, the bank that is asking for more security on Wall Street.
Common New Yorkers in recent weeks have become competent in finance.
A woman to my trusted Chinese supermarket, speaking on the phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the bank went bankrupt, and to his emaciated CEO Dick Furd in full familiarity, as if giving up a lazy partner.
And Lyn, the door in uniform, almost fifty years of my condo, changed the theme from our normal conversation topic about Brad and Angelina or the delivery of my expense.
She told me, after my visit to the bank, "Now I have all my savings in market funds!.
I've changed, I'm not taking any chances."
Moslem tombs desecrated while Austria turns right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, on the left side of the Austrian right wing of the Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right party Vlaams Belang, took part in a demonstration to present the organization "City Against Islamization" in Antwerp, on Thursday, 17 January 2008.
They bring signs like the street representatives mosques with a red line passing through.
The police blamed the right-wing extremists for desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same week that the political parties on the far-right have earned a lot of money in the national general elections.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged at the Traun cemetery, near Linz, in a few hours between Friday night and this morning, in what the police believe was organized action.
Guilts have traced Jewish symbols like the Star of David on some graves, but detectives believe it may have been an attempt to mask extremist motivations led by hatred for Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is somehow linked to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of profanation, which took place toward the end of Ramadan, a month of religious importance for Muslims.
In the meantime, Austria embarked on a spiritual search trip following its right turn in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two extreme right parties that took almost 30% of the votes, the Austrian Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, made a campaign with vehemently anti-immigration tickets and some of their slogans were defined by xenophobic critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the votes, campaigned against the sails and the burkas and also expressed his opposition to the foods that are perceived as connected to Islam.
At the final meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties seem to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, implying that they are political symbols of a continuous Islamisation of Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses made immediately after the elections, which established the extreme right as the nation's strongest political bloc, indicating that the change was brought predominantly by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Travel abroad forbidden to Gary Glitter.
Gary Glitter, the glamour star of rock guilty of sexual abuse of minors, has been forbidden to travel to France and Spain by the court.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after they informed the authorities that they wanted him to go to Spain through France.
The ban on travel abroad was granted to the Kent police last Thursday after it had provided the magistrates with evidence of previous Glitter's arrests for sexual abuse of minors.
Glitter, the real name Paul Gadi, was not present at Ashford's painting in Kent but was represented by Corker Binning's lawyers.
A spokesman for the Court Service said: "On Thursday, 25 September, at Ashford, the Kent police filed a request to prevent the journey abroad of Mr. Paul Gadd to France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd was not present in person."
Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad as requested by the register of convicted persons for sexual offences.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
He is also asked to give the police a seven-day notice on his scheduled departure date.
Failure to notify the authorities may lead to a five-year prison sentence.
The Kent police said they don't want to discuss individual cases or possible movements of Glitter in the country.
A spokesperson for the Kent police said: "The Kent police will do everything they can to protect children in this country or abroad.
"From our point of view, it is easier to control someone who stays in the UK because we have suitable comprehensive systems to manage any potential risk more effectively.
"Protecting the residents of Kent is the main concern of the Kent police and we are working closely to monitor the behavior of convicted persons for sex offences registered in the country to minimize any possible risk to the public.
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after having spent 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for having abused two 10 and 11-year-olds.
When Glitter came he flew to Bangkok where he was supposed to board a flight to London.
But he said he felt sick and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities would not have put him on the passport check and finally took a flight to Hong Kong.
Even the Chinese authorities did not let him in and returned to Bangkok where the Thai police and immigration officials insisted that he return to England.
In the end he arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on August 22 and remained there while his lawyer David Corker went to Uxbridge, west of London, since Scotland Yard had successfully applied for an order to include him in the register of convicted persons for sexual offences.
Glitter was previously incarcerated in the UK in 1999 for possessing images of child abuse.
A source of the Ministry of the Interior said that Jacqui Smith, the Secretary of the Interior, felt reassured and happy that Glitter had been stopped by travelling to France and Spain.
"I photograph the master away from the scene to draw his character" Günther Bauer, photographer
Neither heels nor flying nor clothes from the beginning.
Only the essence of the great masters of flamenco, stripped of the concentration that characterizes the interpretation, to look at the relaxed appearance of man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Two inseparable faces, except in the private, in those moments away from the public, when the intimacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of the hands, are natural because they do not have to go on stage.
German Günther Bauer in "Flamenco-People" alternates the theatricality of some shots to singers, dancers and guitarists on stage with the less known side of these masters.
With this objective, the photographer offers an original iconography of flamenco, taking it from different visual angles.
The exhibition, included in the schedule of the Month of Flamenco Photography, reflects the international importance of this dance, every day more and more," explains the artist and clarifies that in "Flamenco-People" it could also be common people, but seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists, interpreters or performers on the scene.
These people depicted "on the street" are "artists able to convey passion, sadness, joy when they are on stage ... and capture the audience.
In order to capture the personality of these greats, it is not necessary to portray them on stage,
because their personality and character are interior.
What I was interested in was to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture with the camera the personality of the big flamenco."
With the passion for the "Cante de las Minass" festival, Bauer started in 1997 a long journey aimed at shooting singers, guitarists or dancers using a laser camera.
They are portraits that, because of the type of machine and the material, remember classical photography.
The application of different stylistic techniques breaks with the traditional principles of the image, giving the modernity photo, according to an idea that reflects the conception of the flamenco proper by Bauer: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and is able to surprise every day."
Not dancing, singing or playing in itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, able to conquer the audience with his art.
The search for a meeting with the essential elements, with the magic that becomes visible in a certain way of feeling and being, are and have been the constant of this work, in exhibition these days at the El Photomata gallery.
Famous flamenco artists such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are included in this selection of about seventy portrait artists.
The project has become a kind of flamenco anthology, and will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits displayed on the occasion of the exhibition.
The passion for portraits led Bauer to repeat the idea two years ago with "Portraits of veteran athletes" ("SportARTproject").
Although in "Flamenco-People" the concept is different, the photographer admits "I love to portray people, to know them and to be able to penetrate for a moment into their lives, whether this is a long or short moment.
I think the portrait is the most difficult genre in photography.
You meet or confront people, people you don't even know or give you only a few minutes to take the picture.
Beyond these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to put my ideas into practice."
The collection of portraits of the contemporary flamenco, entitled "Flamenco-people" is set up at the El Photomata gallery, at the number 20 of via de la Mata, parallel to Via Alameda de Hercules, and will be open to the public until the next 16th October.
Vargas Llosa reveals that the novel he's writing is a "silver"
It is set in places that still do not know and deal with unknown topics: despite this, Mario Vargas Llosa is caught up with a new project to which he is working, a novel whose protagonist, Roger Casemant, is an Irish nationalist who has lived in Congo for twenty years and has crossed Amazonia.
Since always favoured for the Nobel Prize for Literature, the writer confessed yesterday at the Hay Festival in Segovia, that the project he is dealing with today is "a fool" and that "everything indicates that I shouldn't write it."
"If I had good sense, I would not write it, but I will do it equally and hope to finish it as soon as possible," he concluded his intervention at the festival for the exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that for four days he saw passing through the city of the Aqueduct a hundred writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "La cità y los dogs" was, as foretold, the prominent figure at the third edition of the festival of the word.
Vargas Llosa, who won the prize of the Hay Festival to be the most voted writer by the participants – an ancient edition of Dickens's "Our mutual friend" book, filled the places of the Juan Bravo theatre.
Presented by Félix Romeo, the writer found himself in front of an audience to whom he flew the time when the Peruvian, with a wonderful memory and with great doses of humor, evoked as a nacque in him the literary vocation, derived from the "extraordinary adventure" of the "pleasant to read" and "to live beyond what I lived"; as he writes in "disciplined mode" to supplement the "lack of inspiration", with an intense work of documentation, drafting and continuous remaking; such as Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas have influenced his vocation and as "the images of memory" are the basis on which they lay their stories.
The Spanish-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and to know if books can change people's lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is a pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience," said Vargas Llosa, claiming that, on the contrary, "it has effects" and that "it makes people more anti-conformist." That is why he invited writers to "not yield to the frivolity" and "take responsibility" for their vocation.
Time hinders the Pozoblanco Festival, depriving it of the races
The celebration of the races that should have sealed the days of the Pozoblanco Festival was suspended yesterday morning, after the bullfighters selected for the races had verified that the ground conditions of the square were not adequate.
Therefore, the company, in agreement with Fermin Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernandez, decided to suspend the celebration of the race.
The weather came against this Festival, preventing you from celebrating two days and three days.
On Saturday, the rain prevented the second race of bulls.
The signs included Jose Luis Moreno, Curro Diaz, and Juan Bautista, who were supposed to face a bull of Castilblanco.
Therefore, the Festival had regular performance only on Friday.
On this occasion it was Daniel Luque to triumph, cutting three ears and coming out in triumph, after having coughed with taste and aesthetics.
The same afternoon Alejandro Talavante completed his two races by receiving greetings and an ear, granted more by the public than by reason of the race itself.
The worst among all was El Juli, passing from the arena of Los Llanos without glory and without penalty.
With the second bull, after a tremendous crutch, the whistles of most of the public were won.
A van with two thousand kilos of hashish exceeds the place of lock in Alava
Five minus ten in the morning.
Agents intimidate the high to the two occupants of a van that instead of stopping away.
The agents charged the height to the two occupants of a van that instead of stopping, ran away.
Their load, more than two tons of hashish, is a good reason not to stop.
The officers, after having followed them, are able to arrest one of the two occupants, a man about 28 years old, identified as A. A. J., as reported in the statement by the Basque Department of Internal Affairs.
The arrested individual is accused of drug trafficking and forgery of public documents.
The accident occurred when some road officials in Alava were conducting a transport check on the N-1, at the point where it crossed the municipal district of Armiñón.
They rushed to stop a van for inspection when the driver, transgressing orders, accelerated sharply and went beyond the lock.
Agents went on track until the vehicle, after a couple of kilometers, stopped on the road and its two occupants fled into a forested area.
Ertzaintza agents were thus able to arrest one of the fugitives and capture the 2,178 kilograms of hashish that carried and took action once the van, a Iveco Daily, was inspected.
The hashish panes, which were in the rear of the vehicle, were subsequently placed in police custody for a thorough investigation and weight detection.
Moreover, since the officials found that the registration had been "doubled" since it did not coincide with that reported in the documentation of the van, the offence of forgery of public documents was also charged to the arrest.
Ertzaintza is continuing investigations to arrest the second person suspected, who managed to escape as already stated, and to determine the origin of the drug seized.
A. A. J., 28 years old, was taken to the police station to carry out the appropriate procedures and be available to the judge in the next hours.
Arrested the actress Heather Locklear by driving under the effects of drugs
The actress Heather Locklear, Amanda of the popular Melrose Place series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the effects of drugs.
A witness saw him performing risky maneuvers while trying to get out with the car from the parking lot in Montecito, as revealed in the People magazine by a spokesperson of the California street.
The witness specified that around 16.30 the Locklear "dipped the accelerator deeply, making a lot of noise, and trying to drive the car out of the parking lot with brusque maneuvers forward and backward. Doing retroming, he passed several times in front of his sunglasses."
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who at first sight had apparently not recognized the actress, saw that Locklear had stopped in a nearby street and had left the vehicle.
She was this person alerting emergency services, because "she was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, he found the actress sitting inside his vehicle, which partially blocked the road.
"It seemed confusing," and for this reason the agents led it to a specialized drug and alcohol centre to test it.
According to a police spokesman, the actress has shown herself to be collaborative and the hypothesis of excess alcohol has been dropped since the beginning, even though "according to what the officers observed at first, we believe that Locklear was under the effects of some drug."
Locklear was arrested with the suspicion of driving under the effect of some substance not better specified and was imprisoned in the local prison around 7 p.m., to be released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear was restored by a specialist clinic in Arizona after having been treated as a result of an episode of anxiety and depression.
Callares urges the Andalusian federation of the UI to assume its responsibilities in the Silva case
The coordinator-general of the UI and member of the Izquierda Unida party, Gaspar Llamazares, confirmed today that it will be up to the regional training federation to take a decision on the case of the former advisor to the Youth and Sport of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week following the indictment of customerism.
"In these cases I am particularly a federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization to assume its responsibilities," Llamazares said with regard to the resolution that the party will have to adopt with regard to what has so far been the advisor to the Council of Seville.
However, the leader of the UI has stressed the need for "transparency" in all possible investigations regarding the irregularities that Silva would have committed. "The UI has always wanted this kind of investigation to be the most transparent."
Similarly, he stressed that training is regulated by "very strict ethical codes for all public offices."
"Blood of May", the epic bet of Garci
Inspired by Benito Pérez Galdós' National Episodes, Jose Luis Garci proposes in Sanre de maggio the famous Spanish revolt against the French, in what is the most ambitious film of his filmography, with almost 15 million euros of budget.
With this film, the director tried to "illustrate the stream of characters and at the same time the social analysis" that he always admired in the work of the famous novelist, explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutierrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of a large cast of performers.
Sanre de maggio, long more than two and a half hours, debuts this Friday in cinema halls, to become a television miniseries in the future more than four hours on TeleMadrid.
Great admirer of the literature of Galdós, Jose Luis Garci claims to have realized with this film "a dream of his childhood", and believes he has to thank Hope Aguirre, who from the Community of Madrid had commissioned him three years before turning a memorial film for the second centenary of May 2nd. The director had agreed that the story of basing on the novel Episodios Nacionales.
The 15 million budget allocated entirely by the Madrid Community represented for Garci a "one-stopping opportunity" to recreate the scenes and appropriate costumes to portray a "a foolish Spain that missed the choice of the leader to fight for and the fact that the struggle for independence led the people to a huge delay in development under the kingdom of Ferdinand VII" observed Garcia.
However, the director regrets that he did not receive funding equal to that of Alatriste or Los phantomas de Goya - more than twice as much as Sanrre de maggio, so it was not possible to turn some scenes provided by the screenplay that he himself had signed together with Horacio Valcarcel, a collaborator of almost all his career.
This, for the director of Return to begin with, has influenced what is his usual work practice, the staging with actors, with which he often uses to try before turning together with those who will not be part of the cast, because he considers it "humiliant," considering that "part of the director's work resides in going to theater and cinema to know what is happening in the field in which he works."
Many of the performers, part of whom fall into the cast of Sanre de Mayo, prove in front of his car, as in the case of Michael Rell, Carlos Larranaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
Candidate to Oscar for four times - winning one - Garci believes that none of the three films candidates to represent Spain this year at the Academy of Hollywood - its Blood de mayo, Seven tables de billar French and, the last selected Los sunflowers blind -, do not represent the younger generation of Spanish cinema "that should instead be known."
From this movie, Garcia doesn't expect prizes.
"At first you think you're working for posters, then you realize that you're only working for prosperity, and at some point you agree to just shoot an extra film," Garci explains after more than 30 years of career.
Isabel Bayon rediscovers the Seville essence of the Ballerina Tortola Valencia
A sevilla ballerina pays tribute to another ballerina equally in Seville.
Carmen Valencia Tortola, father of Catalan (Florence Tortola Ferrer) and mother of Andalusia (Georgeina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the district of Triana, and at the age of three he moved with his family to London.
He was a dancer of free dance and a specialist in oriental dances.
She led a fascinating life and was a pioneer of women's emancipation, of the caliber of Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was Buddhist and vegetarian, and defended the cause for the abolition of corset that prevented women from moving freely.
The life of this woman, who marked a revolution in dance and aesthetics in Europe between the two wars, has always fascinated Isabel Bayon.
"I would have liked to work with Pepa Gamboa and she offers me this character. I felt incredible."
The ballerina supports: "We do not intend to tell her whole life, but to gather her spirit.
The titles of his dances suggested some basic elements of flamenco.
So, "Dance of the butterfly" suggested me a guajira, or "Dance of the snake" some tanghi.
His dance was sensual and I was told that my way of dancing is also part of this aesthetic," he explains.
The scene includes two exceptional contributions: that of Miguel Poveda, who will sing Isabel again in one of his performances, as it does in "The Open Door"; and that of Master Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work with that which had been his pupil.
"Matilde interprets Adult Tortola, the character of maturity.
I'm happy because he agreed to work in my work and I feel very honored about this."
The setting also includes the musical composition and guitarists such as Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, the song of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga y Moi of Morón; the percussions of El Pájaro, as well as the rape of Rafa La Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfran Juárez "who plays the role of eternal companion of these artists who have been dive all round, and who have always had many Spaniards."
In the work there is also in some form the life of this woman who takes place in distant places, especially for that time, such as India, the United States or Russia, and then all of Europe, since he usually resided in London.
"I wanted to remind you, because I think it's one of the women who have had a huge influence in a given historical period and now nobody remembers it and much less considers its work as something of value," Bayon says.
The show will start today, at 8.30 p.m. at the theater of Lope de Vega.
With the publication of the "Diario de una poeta recién remado" also closes the Triennio
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado" at the church of Saint Stephen (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities scheduled by the Councillorate to the Culture of the Junta dell'Andalusia to celebrate the "Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramon" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize for both literature and death.
Thus, the "Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramon" concludes with the re-editation of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and with the travelling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: Aquel Chopo de Luz", which was inaugurated last May and which, after touching the various provinces of Andalusia, will be expected to arrive in New York in conjunction with the International Congress.
In addition, the Councillorate to the Culture of the Junta dell'Andalusia has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diario de un Poet Reciencasado", curated by Pietro Tabernero and illustrated by James Perez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and work of one of the most valued Andalusian poets.
America likes a little less without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of these."
The phrase is that of actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Ausencia de malice" and gives the idea of the impotence of American cinema, and of the whole of America, in front of the shocking idea that Newman has left.
And yet it cost him a lot to deliver an Oscar.
And since 2007 he's been retired.
And it was also known that he was very sick.
Despite this, it was a very hard blow for everyone.
"Sometimes what a test goes beyond any expression, and I have now lost a great friend," cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country could be better thanks to its existence."
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
A father of cinema and country died at a particularly dark moment, for fear of terrorists and markets, with self-esteem from the American people on the ground, desperate for new motivations to feel worthy.
When times are so difficult, men so without virtue and remain well people to admire, it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For everyone he embodied the ideal platonic beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and defender of lost and won causes, from the foundation for the fight against drugs created in honor of the first child who died of overdose to the creation of the brand of household and biological food.
All gifts to a country where it is hard to go beyond a suicidal food culture.
The wave of admiration went beyond Hollywood, without healing either nationality or passports.
The last James Bond, English Daniel Craig, observed that he didn't die a man, ended a time.
Another Englishman, Sam Mendes, an award-winning director with Oscar, said that working with Newman was nothing less than the height of his career.
The bad boy who arrived from Australia, Russell Crowe, ventured to define Paul Newman his greatest inspiration.
"He has left an example of a very high level for all of us," notes George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today tries to live as Paul Newman did: keeping in high regard the need of righteousness and having a serious private life and far away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or possible in the media jungle today.
However, some of them try us and Paul Newman is a good example for these.
He divorced once but remained married for 50 years with Joanne Woodward, to whom he remained faithful even though he certainly missed the opportunity to be one.
"Why am I going to eat out of hamburger today, if I have a steak at home?" I used to joke.
In the sky, he is proud that his daughters are also his admirers, which is not so common in America.
"Of all the great roles he played, none was as proud as that of devoted husband, loving father, caring grandfather and passionate philanthropist," they say.
The imperfect race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that sooner or later the Olympics will be held in Madrid and, after the attempt failed for 2012, this could happen in 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday's race, I'd say no!
They called it the "perfect race", but in my opinion it was by far the worst to which I have witnessed.
A lot of nonsense, which, if subsequently taken into account at the evaluation and I had to examine them, would be absolutely negative.
But let's go by order and start from the beginning.
The nonsense started with the removal of the dorsal, which was supposed to leave before.
It didn't seem to be a bad idea, but if you're forced to go, it's to take everything (including the chip to avoid the codes during the race).
No, it's not.
You had to go only to take the back (first nonsense, go only for this) and (after its tail), surprise! they had only shirts of size 'S' (second nonsense, because I need an XL size).
What world do we live in?
Is it the fault of the crisis if they have decided to buy only small shirts, made with less fabric and therefore less expensive?
Well, things like this are unusual compared to the same day of the race.
Besides having to go very soon to take the chip, the queue waiting was 15 minutes and, more than that, you had to deposit the backpack.
The waiting period is more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a race to which more than 11,000 people are expected.
So, as was predicted, the race began that we had not even deposited the backpack yet, although, once they had succeeded in the enterprise, recovery was even worse.
In addition, the rain threatened the wait of more than 40 minutes, to which attempts of popular rebellion and assault at the stand were added.
In at least 500 people tomorrow we will certainly have pneumonia, and some, like me, will not even be in the correct ranking because of the chip that, I suppose, did not correctly record the arrival.
In the future, if they ask me about the perfect race, this will certainly not enter my thoughts.
So I think we will continue to dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft seeks receptionist (virtual)
At the MlT conference on emerging technologies, Microsoft previewed a new system of recognition of image and human interaction, a sort of artificial intelligence, but without much intelligence, able to perform some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or, in the case illustrated by Microsoft, a shuttle service to move on the company's campus) assisting the phone user.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this "receptionist" is able to know how many people there are in a room, who are - including remembering their position in the company - and to listen to and understand the key words in a conversation with them.
It can also group those present in conversation groups.
In the video example the receptionist detects a third person, but understands that it does not belong to the group he is talking to and that he is not an employee of the company.
She asks if she is there to visit someone and tells her that she will be at her disposal shortly.
Everything without a blue screen.
Impressive.
But this, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better to focus on, for example on the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week we talked a lot about a change of strategy in Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if computers were equipped with essential functions and less loaded with commercial garbage, they would go five times faster – hey! Steve, it's going to be the least.
A complete discovery, if you consider that Microsoft, version after version has continuously added to Windows functionality and "extra".
The change of direction is appreciable.
Microsoft is right: the operating system goes increasingly losing importance, and with it the software.
When Google launched Chrome into the network, I was one of those who supported the theory that was Google's first step to compete with Windows.
Many rightly point out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is an essential element for hardware and software to communicate.
You perform the same function as your wife or husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but perhaps it is necessary to think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute but relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People pay less and less attention to the operating system, and more and more to the Web browser.
You only take the computer to launch Explorer or Firefox - or Chrome - and we spend more time daily browsing the network than in a remote window environment.
What is half of the operating system's applications for?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less overload, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services to provide a valid alternative to Google.
They have a desperate need, indeed, and I have a small example here.
I took the photograph inserted in this post in one of Microsoft's workplaces for employees in Redmond, at the beginning of this month.
On the drink machine a sign prompts them to use their own search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees use Google to do network research.
Last week, moreover, the delay in developing the new version of Windows Mobile 7 has been confirmed.
It will not be put on the market in the first months of 2009, but probably at the end of the year, if not even in 2010.
Microsoft will definitely try to jointly launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The mobile phone, after all, is becoming more and more a computer.
But the delay, with Android and iPhone already on the market, is criminalizing.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso carried her to the Blue Coast, Leonardo di Caprio was shining in Edward Zwick's 'Diaman de sangura', as well as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's 'Padrino' as well as being part of the typical uniforms of the gay musculous parish.
And if we try to list the appearances of the stars, we can evoke the image of the force with the pointed baffles that lifts the weights in the surrounding circus.
This is basically the typical men's shirt, with the inside of cotton, tight and without sleeves.
It is the 'tank', as the Anglophones call it, though, the Belgian Fabulous Marcel stands out above all.
The "Marcel" excels in comparison to the others for the high quality of cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive coat and for the small Belgian flag (recognisable only), which the most emblematic models of the shirt bear as detail on the neck.
The "Marcel" excels in comparison to the others for the high quality of cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive coat and for the small Belgian flag (recognisable only), that the most emblematic t-shirt models carry as detail on the neck.
And be careful, because the Belgian company's production is not just about the famous "tank".
It also includes college shoes, retro boxer, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, marine shirts, baby-dolls, mini-short...
Intimate clothing designed to be comfortable.
And it's a shame to use them as underwear.
They're too beautiful.
"I want to be a young mom, the candidate doesn't worry me"
The great resemblance with her sister did not prevent her from developing her personality.
Monica Cruz is small, but full of vitality.
At present, the Cruz sisters have taken their new fashion activities very seriously.
For Monica, they are much more than beautiful girls and celebrities who lend their name.
It was in Paris for the promotion that the Mango firm made of its new home, as well as the presentation of the most important prizes that the Spanish fashion house sponsors.
Warm and shy, quickly conquers you.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that we created my sister Penelope and I for the autumn-winter season of Mango, as well as to participate in the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and at the dinner at the Opera in honour of Valentino.
Let's say, a very intense day, but at the same time, exciting.
What is your new Mango collection from in this fourth working season for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and I like the movies of the '50s is '60s, from here we get various inspirations.
Then, I love losing myself in the city and watching how women dress, how they combine and mix their clothes. I often do so.
Ballerina, actress and stylist, you're a very versatile woman, right?
I think so, although in the end, everything is confusing and there are many elements in common.
I, as a child, liked the clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to bake in my aunt's closets and see her clothes.
It was a bomb, even better than going to the playground.
Then, once a ballerina, I always paid a lot of attention to dress.
It is known that dancers really like to have their own style to go to class and to the essays, to look at themselves in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress, when they deliver you the wardrobe is the moment you actually meet the character.
So, everything goes together, yes, with a lot of respect for the designers and the professionalisms.
Not long ago, you've been in crisis for 30 years?
But not.
Never felt better, I like the idea of 30 years.
I find that at that age women are mature and have a good experience to enjoy life by making fewer mistakes.
The biological watch doesn't scare me.
I've done the things I wanted since I was a child and this has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, you think you're a mother, don't you?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother because I'm asked by my own body and I also want to be a young mom, that's not what I want to miss.
As for the candidate, I'm not too concerned.
What I will do is give my son a lot of happiness and a lot of love to educate him.
As far as cinema is concerned, you are waiting for several films to be filmed in different rooms last year.
That's right, and I really want them to go out.
Being a woman who comes from the theater, I am very impatient and restless, I would like everything immediately and clearly, but it cannot always be so.
I want you to climb "The Last Hour" and "In search of the tomb of Christ."
Let's see if you'll like them.
A few days ago you debuted on the bridge with Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not that you were on the bridge as a model.
It's just that Naomi Campbell, who I've known for a long time, called me to invite me to go to London to participate in a charity show for her organization "Girls for a better world" and the clothes we've been wearing – I brought two pieces of our collection to Mango - were auctioned to collect funds for this Naomi NGO.
People don't know this tender side of Naomi.
So many things are said about her, that I know her a long time ago I can confirm that I'm not that true.
Besides, I'm dealing with this good part in which you're involved.
He asked me to parade for a noble cause, but if he asked me to do the pine, I would have done it the same.
If it's to help the women of the third world, you can't pull back.
Alcoholic receivers will have to install the "alcoholck"
The Ministry of Internal Affairs requires drivers with three administrative penalties for excessive alcohol in their blood, to install in their car the system which prevents driving the vehicle in a state of darkness or if it does not blow into the device.
The measure was announced last June and is already included in the annual report of the Attorney General of State, which will be a one-year pilot project.
The purpose of this project is to reintegrate the driver, since this will have to attend a rehabilitation course on the road.
In addition to the Attorney General's Office for Road Safety, the Directorate-General for Traffic (DGT) and the Institute of Technology for Automobile Safety (FITSA) will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of the drivers reported more than once by driving in a state of darkness then return to driving the car.
The alcoholock would avoid it, because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the alcohol rate in the air spiral and prevents the car from moving if the driver does not blow, or when a concentration of alcohol higher than the permitted one is detected.
The cost is more than EUR 1000 and would be borne by the sanctioned.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles with these devices allow to reduce up to 65% of the infringements committed during the first year of introduction.
And in Spain it is calculated that it could save the lives of 115 people a year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to stop these behaviours before they become criminal offences.
And in order to facilitate their development, since the legal reform can be carried out on an ordinary basis, and, without a doubt, the reform necessary for the criminal procedure would require an organic law.
However, the device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial solution, although it has already been introduced experimentally in some industrial and public vehicles.
Just tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on an initiative by the PSOE in which it is proposed to install this system on school buses, as has already been done in France.
In Mexico, and without "peep-toes"
With British punctuality, at 17.40, the second programme, the Spanish plane in which they traveled the principles of Asturias landed in the presidential hangar at Benito Juárez airport in Mexico City.
The sun was setting but the rays still forced them to use their hands as a visor to see the royal couple get off the plane.
At the foot of the ladder, the Spanish ambassador and the other authorities.
A few hours earlier I had asked a taxi driver on the road, if he knew that the Spanish principles were about to visit the city to formalize an official trip.
- Ah, very well, so you can't go to the airport to charge people at that time... you're from here or...
No, no, sir, you're Spanish, but you lived here for a couple of years.
- Ah, very good...
On the other hand, the Mexican press knows very well who are the principles of Asturias and the importance of travel.
There are many waiting in the airport hangar, crushed by the red carpet and the military cordon made up of 27 marine soldiers who offer the greeting of honor.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in sea blue, and she, the princess, hairy in the wind, very sober, does not use her usual "peep-toes," perhaps told her that in Mexico City she threatened bad weather.
They give the photographers a smile and a short stop before going to the room where they are expected by the official committee.
At the door of the hotel where they stay, one of the four largest in the city, they are expected by a spiritistic reporter of Mexican television.
The best prize offered by fashion
There's probably no place in the world more suitable for presenting a fashion prize, than Paris and there's probably no more exquisite designer and living bont of Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of El Button-Mango Fashion Awards, to promote international promotion of new talents in the field of fashion.
It offers a €300,000 prize.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at his designs in the Mango showcase at Number 54 of Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost cried with emotion.
Moreover, it is the second large company store in Europe and has just been opened with 1,335 square meters of extension.
The first one is in London.
The many events, combined with the desire to please the designer Valentino who presided over the jury of the competition, began with a dinner of luxury at Opera Garnier in Paris.
With the proximity of the most exquisite TVs in Chagal, the Presidential Gala table prepared by Mango, was even more spectacular.
Nati, with his heart broken and making necessity virtues, due to the recent death of his brother, has worn a dress of the House and some complements of ELAH to take away the breath and arm of his son Luis - a boy almost two meters high - accompanied Valentino to the presidency of the dinner of tribute.
Andik, owner and lord of Mango, made the house honors and as knight who is finished, together with Baron Rotchil, without jacket, because they both gave them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who managed the store in pants and shirts – designed by her hand – turned to dinner, wearing a very sensual black long dress and excited during the night walk accompanied by Goya Toledo inside the opera, when they showed us the hall for ballet essays and she, remembering other times, grabbed a bar and outlined a "big fold".
Inés Sastre did not stop for the walk in the premises of the palace, but had shown us earlier photos of his son on his mobile.
The next day we were glad to see Olivier Martinez – another boy who moved in motion – and John Travolta, who had arrived at the Hotel Intercontinental in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and had previously made sure that there were no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, there's life.
1001, the antistress number
There are no 1,000 but 1,000 and a way to forget the chaotic and frantic daily life.
And as if this wasn't enough, they're all collected in a book that will bring relaxation in the libraries on September 30.
The awakening is almost a punishment when it spins every morning at 7, but it is even worse to imagine being involved in the frantic pace dictated by modern life.
The office is called tension and the backache computer.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
However, there are neither one nor two methods to combat daily exhaustion and fatigue to get rid of the world of work.
No, this number amounts to nothing more and nothing less than 1001.
Beyond yoga positions, classic massage or "spa" treatments, Susannah Marriott collects in the pages of his book, all a "menu" of tailor-made options for taste and time of each.
The anti-stress work is called "1001 ways to relax" and its calm will reach the libraries thanks to the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that it is not possible to conquer calmness in areas such as work or in personal relations, this "manual" denies such conviction.
In addition, it suggests alternative solutions, such as being in contact with nature, or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline does not already flow into your veins to regain the balance of the body and stress has become a problem, it is time to sit on the couch, turn your mind off and focus on reading.
Talking in the sleep
Some kids talk during the night.
I am not referring to those who wake up very agitated to tell us something that happened to them the previous day, but to those children who speak while staying asleep.
The first time it happens, at most it gets a scare, but actually it doesn't matter much.
This is a benign alternation of the so-called sleepwalk.
It manifests with a certain frequency, especially in children and adolescents.
Surely, most of you have said that you had spoken in your sleep.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadicly (once in life, for example associated with a high fever episode) or with greater regularity (every day, once a week, once in the month ...), the day after the child no longer remembers anything.
There is no single reason to explain this phenomenon.
Sometimes there are episodes related to other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night fears, night enuresis (piping in bed), or sleepwalking, but not necessarily so.
As already mentioned, it can be associated with very high stages of fever, stress or overcrowding.
In any case, it is a phenomenon that is not yet studied.
Also the intensity with which it appears is extremely variable.
It may happen that the person speaks with a very quiet tone of voice, with loose words, almost in a whisper or that happens the contrary (scream, shout, long speeches ...).
In cases where the event is particularly intense, it would be necessary to observe the child and possibly consult a specialist to see if there are any issues that are generating an abnormal state of anxiety as an outlet for the situation.
We have said that this is a benign alteration so there is no treatment unless it is associated with other sleep disorders that can be treated (e.g. if combined with insomnia or stress).
What can be done, however, is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to get too excited about the baby before he goes to sleep.
Propose quiet games and avoid TV shows or series that arouse fear or suggest violence.
With very nervous children for whom it is difficult to relax, you can use relaxation techniques to help them gain a certain inner calm.
This will allow the child to sleep more quietly.
Once the sleepilocks appear trying to keep calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day they will remember nothing of what happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake him.
It's useless, because he's not aware of what's happening, and you'll interrupt his sleep.
Although he's talking, he's sleeping and so he's resting.
Remember that if you look very worried and the episodes have a certain frequency, it is better to consult a doctor or check where there is such a great anxiety in your child.
If you understand what he says (which is not the most common situation), do not fall into the temptation to interrogate him for information.
You will get nothing, because he is asleep and therefore unconscious to organize his thought.
In addition, you are able to hear what he says but not to see what he is dreaming about, so you must pay close attention to the interpretation of the information and the conclusions to which it might lead.
Never tell the child that you could ask him at night to know his secrets.
Not even for a joke.
Something like that causes enormous anguish.
In short, don't worry, it's nothing serious, it's an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
Illhaeusern finally found the road to victory at home after a long unsuccessful period.
Without playing a formidable game, the Black-Yellows have created the greatest number of network occasions by transforming one into the victory of the game.
The pace was not much supported during this meeting where the attackers expressed themselves to fatigue.
After a first attempt by the captain of the Kauffmann host team who swept the seven with a shot from far away, the Illhaeusern began to have the best and one after the other provoked the defense of Dannemarie, Fonderflick from far away, then Hirn high, Romain at the tip and still Diebold.
The Dannemarie responded with a block in the middle of the camp, leaving only the Riahi trigger at the tip of the attack.
The beginning of the second time was decisive with two initial occasions signed Riahi and Temporal for the Dannemaria, and immediately after the first network of Marais for the well-placed Illhaeusern, he resumed a ball rejected on a first attempt of Diebold (53').
But Illhaeusern's gunman will not be able to taste his happiness for a long time and will be expelled a dozen minutes later leaving his teammates in numerical inferiority.
But the Dannemarie will not be able to take advantage of it and will not cause great problems to the Eleven of the Illhaeusern, undivided just to "strengthen" the defense, except in the last minutes of play when, after a rocking action, the ball swung the cross.
Sarkozy meets fishermen in wrath
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will take a stop in Brittany.
From the beginning of the fishermen's demonstration that Monday brutally prevented access to several Breton and Norman ports, the President of the Republic decided to go to the port of Guilvinec on Tuesday morning in the department of Finistère to charm its representatives.
The latter promised to welcome him "with a constructive spirit" and hoped that "they would present themselves with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit which takes place at the same time with the general assembly of the "crisis committee", created by the British fishermen in order to take measures to deal with the impennate gas oil price, which reached its record with an average of more than 1.14 euros per litre.
According to Eliseo David Martinon's spokesman, the president "will discuss with them possible solutions to help companies regain competitiveness and to ensure the working conditions and pay of the sailors".
Fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy to stop.
On Tuesday morning, they conducted "smooth operations" in Morbihan and Calvados, causing almost 10 km of jams.
The port of Quiberon has also been blocked, but the connections to Belle-Ilela have not been interrupted.
On the peninsula of Quiberon a roadblock was carried out.
On Monday the sailors have already proved their determination by burning, starting at dawn, tyres and pallets in front of the fuel deposits at the ports of Brest and Lorient, while taking foot demonstrations in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement extended to the ports of the Atlantic Coast and Manica, such as Sables d'Olonne, in the Vendée, where the vessels remained at the pier, or in Havre, where about twenty boats prevented the movement of commercial ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe et del Croisic, at the Loire Atlantica, interrupted in the evening the blockade of the Total Refinery Note of Donges.
In Boulogne-sur-Mer they decided to wait for the meeting to be held on Wednesday in the ministry to decide any action.
In the Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" will decide on Tuesday the future actions of the movement and the possible participation in the meeting scheduled for the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some British fishermen do not want to be represented by the leaders of the National Fisheries Committee, who did not support the movement.
"The strike will continue" because "fishers will not yield" et "they do not intend to move to Paris," announced, for example, Liliane Cariou, chairman of the Lorient fishing committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay gas tax, currently pay about 50 cents per litre, but estimate that the yield limit of a vessel is only reached with a gas oil of less than 0,30 euros per litre.
Paul Newman the Magnificent
The unforgettable performer of "Butch Cassidy" died of cancer, at the age of 83, in his Connecticut home.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes greeted the film legend and committed actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains delivery forecasts in 2008
This year, the aircraft manufacturer has 215 deliveries, despite the threat of recession on the world economy.
Embraer, the fourth worldwide company in the sector, maintains the delivery forecasts for 2008 with the delivery of 215 aircraft, confirmed his president Fredrico Fleury Curado.
During the first semester, he delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian company relies heavily on the Chinese market, in particular for the planes of the range between 30 and 120 seats.
Up to now, Embraer delivered in eight years 41 planes to Chinese customers.
AIG would yield more than 15% of its activities
The American International Group insurance company, set up by the US monetary authorities, would yield more than 15% of its business in order to repay the $85 billion loan, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
The IGA is ready to consider the sale of most of its activities, in addition to the sale of life insurance branches to the international market and the United States, specifies the paper on the basis of more than authoritative sources.
The Management Board of the AIG met on Sunday evening to examine any transfers, according to the FT.
No confirmation was obtained from the IGA.
The activities that the AIG intends to transfer include the International Lease Financial Corp. Air Leasing subsidiary, its share of 59% of the Transatlantic Holdings as well as its real estate portfolio and its private equity investments, adds the FT.
No final decision has been taken with regard to these transfers, the FT continues.
The AIG must quickly recover liquidity in order to repay the loan of 85 billion concessional from the Federal Reserve, at the cost of seeing the US authorities tax up to 80% of their capital.
Paris: History Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange accused a historic collapse on Monday, after the House of Representatives spoke against the Paulson Plan for the rescue of financial institutions: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a drop never seen, approaching 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Media (DJIA) ended at 10,365.45, below 777.68 points.
In point terms, the worst loss in its history (684,81 points) higher than that of 17 September 2001, the day of the reopening of the Stock Exchanges following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq, the index of major technological titles, lost 199.61 points by closing 1,983.73 and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500, lost 8,81% (i.e. 106.85 points) by closing 1,106.55, according to the definitive closing figures.
Demoralized at the beginning of the sitting, Wall Street collapsed after the unexpected refusal of the bank rescue plan, designed to bring stability to the markets.
With 228 votes against the plan and 205 in favour, the representatives refused funding requested by Treasury Minister Henry Paulson.
About two Republicans out of three refused the plan.
"It's a negative signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," Lindsey Piegza said, by FTN Financial.
"All this indicates how much the market was counting on the project," he added, fearing that within a few days it might already be "too late" to adopt one.
"If the project were actually dying (...) then the witness would quickly be passed to the Fed – Federal Reserve – (the U.S. Central Bank, Ndr) and other central banks to solve the crisis, which would further limit credit conditions," said Brian Bethune, head of the finance and economy sector at Global Insight.
And highlighting the state of emergency," every day that passes to the collapse of a financial institution" in the United States, pointed out the Piegza.
After the Washington Mutual failed on Friday, the authorities organized the purchase of Wachovia banking by the rival Citygroup.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated sharply, calling for urgent intervention in favour of the banks of the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that markets "are not only in the face of an American crisis, but in the face of a global crisis," said FTN Financial analyst.
The bond market has risen sharply.
The yield of the Treasury Bonds with maturity of 10 years has returned to 3,632%, against 3,827% on Friday evening, while the 30-year yield is at 4,161%, against 4,357% on the previous day.
Obama in the lead to the first television duel
After the first Friday debate between the two candidates for the White House, and then a second to know who, between John McCain and Barack Obama, was the winner.
Without any surprise, the general districts of the republican and democratic campaign have proclaimed the respective victory of the television duel, followed by a third of the American families.
Politologist David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, though deserving, has not been brilliant enough to allow him to stop the fall in the five-week presidential polls.
The Gallup Institute, of which a Saturday published opinion poll gives Obama five points (49% versus 44% for McCain), shows that the democratic has had the best.
An instant poll conducted by CbsNews on a champion of undecided voters found that 39% of them consider Obama to be the winner, while 25% points to McCain.
An excellent performance by his friend on the Joe Biden list, expected during the first and only debate with rival Sarah Palin, should confirm on Thursday Obama's advantage.
"To underestimate it would be a mistake.
He has a good intuition," however he warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
The 70-year-old McCain has never stopped promoting his undisputed experience in foreign policy, stressing the opponent's "ingenuity" with regard to the issues addressed during the first face-to-face.
" Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that.." he has often told many shots.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and skills needed to become president," he said.
What yesterday is a continuous target for the Republican television campaign.
Obama, on the other hand, stressed how his election would represent a new future.
Without delay, it has proved concise and precise.
He promoted his predisposition to the right decisions and his intention to restore the image of the United States on the world stage.
"McCain has never understood, unlike Obama," said this weekend, a democratic spot, blaming the Republican for not taking the necessary measures to deal with the impact of the financial crisis on the American people.
During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you, Obama reported yesterday, in front of 20,000 people gathered in North Carolina, under a stormy rain, for an election meeting.
He has not even spoken the words "media class" or "workers." The financial crisis goes to Obama, considered by the Americans as the most suitable person to save the economy on the edge of the precipice.
"Next week could be a decisive turning point," said the influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's economic intuition to that demonstrated by Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the democratic candidate, the current collapse "is the final verdict after eight years of terrible economic policy adopted by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain".
Reiterating the intention to reduce the taxes for 95% of Americans despite Wall Street's subsidies, the senator of Illinois also mentioned among his priorities the achievement of possible energy independence in the country through the promotion of renewable energy and the implementation of a health insurance system.
McCain, for his part, would build a park of 45 nuclear centres by 2030.
Carefully, the two candidates discussed the financial rescue plan of $700 billion (€470 billion) which was adopted last night by the Congress and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "did you not notice that there were elections?"
Young people and opponents manifested on Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to challenge in advance the results of the legislation.
A few hundred Belarusians met on Sunday evening immediately after the closure of the electoral seats in the central square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent character of the legislatures.
While the results were still expected, many young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexandre Loukachenko: "the dictator, resignation".
Some confess that they have not even voted: "What pro? They will do as much as they want, of my vote," says one boy.
They do not believe that the regime that has made it a good example of foreign observers in order to resume dialogue with the European Union is ready to take on a democratic turn.
Penalties, including the prohibition of visas for 40 Belarusian directors and the freezing of assets, could be removed if these elections were considered legitimate by observers.
They weren't, according to the opposition.
"We have been pushed away by the electoral commissions and our observers have not been able to participate in the vote," complained Iuri Potemkine, spokesperson for the Union of the Democratic Forces, an heterogeneous alliance of twelve parties.
"It's a change of facade, notes Alexandre Milinkievitch, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidents and leader of the pro-European movement, since the important one is who counts the cards and in this case is the executive.
If Members of the opposition enter Parliament, it is because they have been appointed, and not elected.
But their entry into parliament may involve a television space, regional meetings and legislative proposals."
The opposition therefore has a duty to join the political game because "there is a need for dialogue with the European Union.
Because if our economy, which is heavily in debt with Russia, is in crisis, and we do not make any reform, we risk becoming a Russian protectorate.
Now we want to be independent."
The opposition fears that the ‘organisation for security and cooperation in Europe that has followed the electoral process will recognize the validity of the ballot.
He stressed that participation shares seemed too high, and that the generalisation of the vote in advance (26% of the voters in Minsk) gave way to all kinds of manipulation.
"Did you not notice that there were elections? Asks social-democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released this year, in August.
There was no one in the election seat.
And there will have been at most five members of the opposition to parliament, the most appropriate to power."
Night silence falls on the square of October.
On television, President Loukachenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission are pleased with their success.
The encounter - Blood is safe again
Hema-Québec celebrated the tenth anniversary of her foundation yesterday, and her president, Dr. FrancineDécary, had all the reasons to rejoice, as the Hema-Québec has become one of the safest and most effective blood suppliers in the world.
And above all, it has regained public confidence, seriously shocked by the scandal of infected blood in the years between 1980 and 1990.
As we know, national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were infected by the acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C in the 1980s.
In the face of such a tragedy and population protests, the Government of Canada conducted in February 1994 a public inquiry, led by Judge Horace Krever, which aimed to shed light on the circumstances leading to such a tragedy and to disseminate recommendations to prevent the recurrence of a similar disaster.
While Judge Krever was late to write a report, some provinces set up a committee with the aim of creating a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, this mandate was carried out by the Gélineau Committee.
Following the Gélineau et Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Hema-Québec to provide Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society (Canadian Blood Society) for all other provinces and two territories.
In 1998, when Hema-Québec began its activities, just 38% of people said they still had confidence in the donation system in Quebec, Dr. Décary recalled.
The situation was mortifying.
Thanks to continued efforts to improve the safety of blood samples and field research over the years, we have regained the public's confidence," he explains before expressing pride that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of Quebec's population now had confidence in Hema-Québec.
Dr. Décary, however, is convinced that "trust is something extremely fragile."
Since its establishment, on 28 September 1998, Hema-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At the time, there were many cases in Europe of the human variant of the mad cow, a new manifestation of Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease, telling him that it has been in the presidency since 1998, the year of the foundation.
"And we absolutely didn't know if that disease could be transmitted through infected blood.
There was therefore based on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélinau reports that when they have doubts and could achieve serious disease, in this case the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease that manifests itself with a degeneration of the brain which inevitably leads to death, exclusion measures are taken.
In April 1999, blood was refused for those who had spent more than a month in the United Kingdom since 1980.
Now, for some years, it has been shown that this disease is clearly transmitted through infected blood.
This episode showed us that it made sense to apply the precautionary principle."
In 1999, a much more efficient technique for the identification of HIV appeared on the market: the nucleic acid (TAN) tests that allow the presence of the virus in the blood of donors to be directly recognized, rather than the presence of antibodies against it, on which the tests used up to that time were based.
The TANs have allowed to reduce the window period, that is, since the person contracted the disease to the one where the first viruses can be identified in the blood thanks to our techniques, the specialist explains.
That period could be reduced to less than one week.
The risk of ignoring the presence of infected donors and not being able to identify them is thus greatly decreased.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS with a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of receiving blood infected with the HIV virus.
"In other words, this means that it will be necessary to distribute 12 million blood samples before someone gets infected with the HIV virus.
Since Hema-Québec distributes 400 000 to 500 000 blood samples every year, it will take more than 24 years before a case of HIV is found transmitted with a transfusion.
I believe that today we can feel calm in receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to recover health, says the head of the Hema-Québec management.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen will emerge in the system.
Not later than a year ago the Chikungunya virus appeared on the Island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted in the blood by an insect.
It is necessary to be constantly vigilant", Dr. Décary continues before stressing that besides having safe resources, Hema-Québec must also provide sufficient resources.
"Necessity increases as the population ages.
As the most aggressive cancer cures, patients often need a supply of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has consequences on the number of donors who on average make up only 3% of Quebec's inhabitants acceptable as donors."
All healthy people who have reached 18 years of age and who meet the eligibility criteria may, however, donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who offer themselves as donors are not accepted, because they are affected by AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have traveled to a country where the latter is widespread, they will be refused for a period of one year.
"With this 3% we can maintain an inventory capable of responding to the needs of hospitals.
The cases of shortage are very rare.
But it is necessary to renew the members of this group of donors as they age and can no longer make donations.
Now it is difficult to convince people to donate blood, but above all, to hold them back and encourage them to become regular donors.
Today, life is so frenetic that it is hardly an hour to donate blood," says Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, the Hema-Québec not only distributes blood samples, but also human tissues, including bone transplants, heart valves, and skin cells that are used almost exclusively for severe burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being deposited with the Hema-Québec who manages the only public bank of umbilical cord blood in Quebec.
In the umbilical cord, which was once considered a biomedical waste, there is plenty of blood rich in stem cells that can cure serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"We celebrated, a few weeks ago, the insertion into the bank of our thousandth sample of cord blood and we plan to take more than a thousand each year.
You should begin to propose them for transplants at the beginning of next year," says Dr. Décary who describes this practice of taking cordon blood as very popular.
"Many mothers are disappointed that they cannot access you", as the Hema-Québec does not have the means to propose this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Calcium - The Impact in semifinal
The Impact Montréal qualified for the semifinal of the A series, winning 3-1 against the Seattle Sounders yesterday, during a second decisive match of the final quarter, at the Saputo Stadium.
The centrocampist Antonio Ribeiro, marked the decisive goal at 90'.
After a first goalless time on both sides, David Texto and Rocco Placentino marked the successive networks for Montreal.
For the Sounders, Roger Levesque was ready to mark Matt Jordan.
Remember that at the first round of the trip-back Friday, the Impact suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex, in Tukwilla, on the outskirts of Seattle.
The Impact will face Vancouver Whitecaps in semifinal.
On Saturday evening in Minnesota, the Thundler completed a first 3-1 in the return game winning 4-3, but the Whitecaps will still participate in the semifinal.
The Impact will face the Whitecaps both Friday and Sunday, but further details will be confirmed in the day.
In brief - Kovalev's decisive network
The Canadien and its axes are ready to start the season again.
The trio formed by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn animated the offensive game phase by winning 3-2 against Panthers, Florida, last night at Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the star of the first meeting, scored a goal, took two steps, and picked up a passage for the victory, in the fourth of the Hab preparatory games.
Decisive for victory the only network signed Kovalev.
"I'm not ready yet, the Russian has warned.
I need another game to feel comfortable."
"He tried to get rid of it in the first period, he noticed Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the outcome of the game.
There was a good ovation."
Charest to the North
The Prime Minister does not exclude the opening of elections before the end of the year.
Concluding the General Council of the Liberal Party, Jean Charest went to Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc, (left), tries to be elected on the occasion of today's partial elections.
"To extend the borders of our last great northern frontier": this is the long-term ambition of Jean Charest, presented to Levis yesterday, through instruments with a strong visual impact, on the occasion of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec.
Behind him, during his speech, the projection of a sort of "Image mill".
On three maxi screens, they confused themselves with the negative spectacles of hydroelectric dams, mining crops, images of Quebec seen with "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Great means as in full electoral campaign.
During the press conference, moreover, the Prime Minister refused to exclude the start of the autumn elections, even though he pointed out that he was very busy.
The "Northern Plan" is the fourth point of a "project" that the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes a first agreement with France on labour, a second agreement between Canada and Europe and other agreements with Ontario.
Often named in the most recent speeches of the Prime Minister, the opening of the North-Northern territory at the 49th parallel- was never the subject of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister has limited himself to explaining why the North would be "a jewel with immense potential", but has not spoken about timings or investment shares, as well as has not explained the precise priorities in the implementation of future projects.
More than anything else, it has merely pointed out what it believes is worth a priority position: hydroelectricity, forests, but above all the mining sector, which has experienced several improvements following the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
According to the list drawn by Charest, the North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds".
That "great territory the double of France" is here, is the Quebec.
Not only is it here, but it is in us," he insisted, as if he wanted to urge a national founder myth.
The foundations of Quebec are rooted in his relationship with the North, he stressed: the fever of gold in Abitibi, the national engineering, the Bay of James.
"It is up to us, it is our future," he added, after a theatrical break to contemplate the immense map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes part of the Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, has specified the Prime Minister during the press conference.
" It is a traditionally maintained position by all governments.
There is a border line on which no agreement has been in place for a long time and, when the opportunity is presented, I will reiterate that position in the name of the government," he said.
After all, "on account of climate change, we must re-evaluate the North," he said speaking of the north-west passage, which will be open all year round because of the melting of ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister estimates that occupying the territory is a duty.’
And the inhabitants of the place, the First Nations and the Inuit ?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec would be very careful about this and that the project should meet their interests, especially those of young people.
Two ex-ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former member of the PQ of Ungava), have already set out to consult about thirty communities.
An interministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) held an important position began work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a great meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a time when" common visions will be provided"
The development of the North would otherwise be based on the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be "closed, ordered and respected the environment," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "project" as a continuum with that of the liberal prime ministers who preceded it.
"As the liberals who have preceded us, we know how to distinguish ourselves to turn the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was also one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which started on Friday with a great cocktail in honour of the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival at head of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to recast the Beauharnois Central in Diga Adélard-Godbout.
"From Godbout, creator of Hydro-Québec, to Lesage who nationalized hydroelectricity, to Bourassa, creator of Baia James, our party has always been able to forge the future," said Jean Charest.
During the press conference, he used another reference, a conservative this time, the "Street towards the North" program by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
Addressing the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, Charest stated that its implementation would be planned for 2012.
"All this remains between us, but I feel that we are going to do it," he confessed to his militants, raising their applause.
In fact, the Prime Minister, who said that in April there would be no elections in 2008 and probably not even in 2009, did not miss the opportunity to start a poll in autumn, which could happen in accordance with the law.
He stresses that he is certainly very busy, particularly in a mission of the Federal Council in China and in the Quebec-New York Summit.
The General Council of the weekend provided the Liberal leadership with a platform for nationalist resolutions, in particular the "constitutional aspirations" that have passed as oil: the PLQ calls above all for the recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
It also hopes that Quebec will appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and that they will have a veto on the decisions taken in Quebec.
As far as the opposition is concerned, the North Floor gulf has been sceptically welcomed.
The PQ leader, Pauline Marois, has resuppled the Northern Development Policy of Quebec launched by the Landry government in 2001.
In your opinion, the Liberal Government, which came to power in 2003, would have failed to comply with its application.
If he had done so," we would have made progress today," said Marois next to Jean-Talon's candidate (scrutiny today), Françoise Mercure.
The ADC has declared that it supports the adoption of the North Plan by the government.
"What we hope for, is that all of this is not simply perceived as a show," said Sébastien Proulx leader, who replaced Mario Dumont, in return today from the holidays.
Letter - A dishonored country
He was Vic Toews, former minister of the "Justice" of the Harper Cabinet, to allow himself to declare, last summer, that Louise Arbor was a " shame" for Canada.
Dishonoring in this way a woman who has fought relentlessly for justice and who deserves all our admiration says much about both the entourage of the Prime Minister and about the same Stephen Harper.
Here we are before a government which is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, who has not returned to the concentration camp in Guantanamo.
A government that completely ignores the fact that Omar Khadr was a mere teenager at the time the defendants took place.
The only government that, despite signing the Geneva Convention, refuses to speak and lets a child-soldier rot under inhuman conditions.
The only one who trusts in a parody of justice to establish the guilt of the accused.
We recall, for information, that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Order of Canadian Lawyers, in particular, call for Omar Khadraffin's return to Canada to be subject to a regular process.
It is proper for the same government that closes its eyes before torture: it doesn't matter to him that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, perhaps forever, after so many years of abuse.
We do not realize it yet, but we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, freedom and "democracy", a word that Harper does not stop ostentating and sounding so foolish about his lips.
Here we have arrived at a time when there is no morals anymore: you can abuse, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen according to the discretion of a government chief until today minority (to see what will happen after October 14th...).
Many voters believe that a party that preaches the Virtue, the Respect of the Law and the Order represents salvation: they do not see that this government has renounced what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
This is exactly the shame, Mr. Toews, in giving up all this, and nowhere else.
Free opinion - Barrick Gold Orwellian Speech
In the September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter by Mr Patrick J. Garver, vice-president of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Pursuing an Orwellian logic, the latter states that the world's largest auriferous company has engaged in a defamation dispute by six million against three authors and a small publishing house with the intention of starting a "transparent public debate".
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of a defamation dispute, but the law.
Without any surprise, this substantial difference is completely hidden by Garver.
Because for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to bring to ruin anyone who wants to support a position contrary to his.
Little does it matter the outcome of the process, writers and editor of the book Canada Nero will have to spend an enormous amount of money in order to organize their own defense and fight, with decidedly odd weapons, against an army of lawyers funded by virtually no bottomless pockets of the mining company.
Moreover, in these struggles with learned weapons, tactics are often to ruin the defendant in order to impose a consensual regulation that will overwhelm him with opposition as well as frighten anyone else to take another decision on the matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was in front of the public that he should have presented his own view of the facts.
Contrary to what happens in many countries where Barrick Gold works, in Canada the debates usually take place with the exchange of views and not with manganese hits.
It would therefore be sufficient for the company to open its books, documents, and establish a real debate, through newspapers, media, publications and funding of independent teams of researchers who could have shed light on the matter.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to have too much confidence in public opinion and to reject in a bad way the petitions and letters in support of the authors of Canada Nero.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he can ask for a "public" debate when his contempt for the same public is quite evident?
In the vice-president's world, it seems that this word indicates exclusively the lawyers who are perfumedly paid and not all of the Canadians; here is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In a democratic system, even denigrators have the right to speak.
What Barrack Gold doesn't understand – or doesn't want to understand – is that the public who supports Canada's authors and publishers does so first because he refuses the brutal means adopted by the mining company.
This public is ready to listen to Barrick and judge, but on the basis of civil exchanges of opinion, and not in the light of what many perceive as a sort of embezzlement (researching the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just given the authors of Canada Black an ultimatum intimating them to suspend the use of that word...)
Beyond Garver's surreal speech, the Barrack Gold sport is a direct attack on the freedom of university research and the pursuit of truth, which is indispensable in every democratic society.
It blocks the right to quote authentic sources and to debate on facts and interpretations, which are the very basis of intellectual work.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to study and discuss uncomfortable arguments with the wealthiest companies in the world, who can do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, he could do it by following scientific standards as the authors of Canada Nero do.
You have the right to reply.
For a long time, the university environment, of which we are part, is able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
The excessive measures by Barrick Gold clearly show that, contrary to its claims, it does not pursue a transparent debate at all.
This is to the detriment of the university world, as is the same public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to take measures to limit abusive claims.
Operation - rescue for Wall Street – Dialogue between Republicans and Democrats
The Bush administration and the leaders of Congress, representatives of the republican and democratic settlement, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the largest rescue-finance plan after the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the US$700 billion plan, which aims to put a stop to the financial crisis that has been on Wall Street for months, has yet to be ratified by the two Congress Chambers.
It provides in particular: checks on its actual implementation by the elected leaders, new mechanisms that guarantee the reimbursement of public money, new provisions to contain the number of houses for missing payments, as well as a right of inspection on the salaries paid to the managers of protected companies.
The American Secretary to the Treasury, Henry Paulson, the President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelose and the representative of the Republican at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday, at the end of a two-day negotiation marathon.
"We have made great progress towards an effective market agreement," said the representative of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson.
"Every decision has been made in such a way as to safeguard the economy and the American people from the current crisis at Wall Street," the Democratic explained.
"It's the crucial point: if we hadn't acted in this way, invaluable discomforts and turmoil would have poured out on the daily lives of Americans," said Republican Judd Gregg.
The conclusion of the negotiations was marked by concerns about the impact of a new failure on investors.
The time limit granted corresponded to the opening up of markets this morning.
The two candidates for the American Presidents were rather in favour of the agreement, but they did not, however, express their dissatisfaction with the adoption of extreme solutions.
The Democratic Senator Barack Obama deserves to have added some provisions to the agreement, in particular the one that will allow the owners to keep their domicile and the one related to wages for managers of companies covered by the State.
"When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of others, there is nothing to rejoice about.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on the American TV screen.
Interviewed on another channel to know if he will vote in favour of the plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied: "I would like to analyze the details, but I hope so."
"Looking at what I've read, it's something that we all have to digest and that will allow us to move forward"
The option of non-intervention is simply unacceptable," he said.
The 700 billion plan aims to buy with taxpayers' money the dubious loans, the assets at risk and the inventable of the American financial institutions.
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis due to the outbreak of a real estate bubble that first led to the collapse of mortgages at risk (mutui) , and then extend to other more widespread forms of credit securities (PCAA) and lead to the freezing of liquidity and the disbanding of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republicans in charge to blow up the first draft of an agreement last week.
It seems to have been out of that blind alley since the Democrats accepted that the "toxic" assets of some companies in difficulty are only protected by the government rather than purchased.
In order to meet everyone, at the Congress, a provision was added that, if the government were to face losses over the next five years due to this programme, it could impose new taxes in order to maintain its balance.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion to which another 100 billion may be added if the President deems it necessary.
The payment of 350 billion should be ratified by a further vote of the Congress.
In exchange for its aid, Washington will obtain shares of participation in protected companies that will pay him dividends in the event of profit and will be able to resell when the waters calm down.
As set out in the plan, the Federal Government will have the opportunity to delay the application procedures relating to real estate loans and set limits on remuneration and start-up allowances paid to the managers of the undertakings involved.
As of today, the architects of the plan would like to submit it to the vote of the House of Representatives, and to the vote of the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all efforts, it is not yet certain that they are given the free way to their plan.
In fact, yesterday there were several votes against the project, both in the republican and democratic groups.
"Of course, Washington doesn't hear you," said Republican Scott Garrett, member of the House Finance Committee, addressing his voters.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But certainly not to take advantage of taxpayers.
Leader of a small group at the Congress nicknamed "the caucus of sceptics", democratic representative Brad Sherman presents the situation differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Fourty hundred eminent economic professors, including three Nobel Prizes, wrote us to say : we ask Congress not to draw bold conclusions and carefully examine the way to be taken," he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, there was once again evidence of the global nature of the crisis.
After an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion dollars).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary when the French bank BNS Paribas announced that it would have renounced the purchase of its competitor, in full failure after the loss of EUR 2 billion (US$ 2.9%) for the crisis of venture real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis has 85 000 employees and is part of the twenty largest banks in Europe and the ten largest insurers.
"It's not lost money, said Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
In return, they gain influence and the right to vote in banking matters.
It is certainly something that savers and families appreciate now that times are uncertain"
During this period, at the other extreme of Manica, the British government seems to be in the process of nationalizing another banking bank for the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all the loans currently under way at Bradford and Bringley Bank, of which more than $41 billion ($75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it will be you to purchase the branches and client accounts of the British bank.
Since the beginning of the economic crisis Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank, after the Northern Rock, to undergo a process of nationalization by the British government.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a committed icon
The blue-eyed beauty was for a long time its ace in the sleeve, for others its weak spot.
Did he get rid of the narcissistic mirror, the American actor from the sordid smile?
Yes and no.
His discretion, sensitivity and obvious talent would have expelled him from that circle of powerful consecrated to true sacred monsters.
What a constancy!
Paul Newman, missing on Friday, at the age of 83, in his Connecticut ranch, following lung cancer, remains one of the last icons of American cinema in the early years.
The less monumental of Brando, to whom he resembled and of which he was for a long time a kind of rival on the screen, more prudent in his game, certainly more fragile, but also he spoke of the freedom and development of dramatic convictions.
Mixed couples often give birth to magical children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 by a German Jewish father and mother of Hungarian origins.
From these European roots one of the glorious visions of the American dream will be born.
A humble ego, the last quality mark.
Since he recognized all a country invaded by the safe made man, by the war fighter of the Pacific, proud in the fight, which in the early 1950s studied dramatic art in Yale, later attended the Actor Studio in New York, before triumphing at theatre, on television and soon at the cinema.
The same man who was a civil rights activist was also the car driver who ranked after the 24 hours of Mans in 1979, as well as the sex symbol, although part of a model couple since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
The shadow zones of a private, discreet, committed star, allergic to the scandals of the show-business, of which we will never be able to fully reveal the mystery.
An honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
This weekend Paul Newman's disappearance was a heart dive for the kinephiles, while his great characters popped the black screen of memories.
Over half a century of American cinema in full transformation is proposed through its interpretations.
They confuse in memory Butch Cassidy's charming cowboy (1969) and that boy is unable to desire his hot wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in La catta on the roof that squirts adapted by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
More recently, we remember him in the shoes of the sensitive Mr. Bridge (1990), troubled by a marriage that did not keep what I promised.
Many more Paul Newman have gone to history.
The boxer Rocky Graziano, criminal, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Lassù someone loves me, by Robert Wise, a role destined to James Dean and resumed after his death, which officially launched Newman in 1956.
That cute evil in the excellent Stangata, Oscar as the best movie in 1973.
A bitter and venicative billiard player in The Spaccone, magnificent movie by Robert Rossen (1961), The color of the money by Martin Scorsese, which was worth him in 1987 the only Oscar on 9 appointments.
That face through the years, it was his.
Him again.
The epochs happen through its path.
Young people know it especially for the cult movie Slap Shot- Dry Chop of George Roy Hill (1977), in the role of Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in Mr. Hula Hoop, of the Coen brothers.
The circle was closed with a last role as the godfather of the Irish Mafia in my father's era in 2003.
Unlike the greatest legends of the cinema that soon abandoned the trade, Newman will stay in the halls long, denouncing Hollywood in all its costumes, parties and concessions.
Bertrand Tavernier, a French filmmaker, defined it, with a tip of irony, as "a living challenge to the underplaying", judging to overstate its performance.
The profession has not always been a game for the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the roles seemed to fall like manna from the sky.
However, he often preferred the role of the marginalized to that of the young actor: neurotic characters, alcoholized carognes or desperate, of which he expressed abandonment and rebellion with his perfect traits.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown nuances of his true, possible sensitivity.
Jennifer's first time in 1968 (based on Canadian novel Margaret Laurence), with Joanne Woodward's wife in the role of the protagonist, traced a fine female portrait of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott for an overdose, dedicated the film Harry and Son to him in 1984, a discreet and sad film.
Among the countless rainstorms on Newman yesterday, his great friend and old comrade of arms Robert Redford (they had recited together in La Stangata and Butch Cassidy) said with infinite sadness" His presence made my life and this country better."
Generosity and love for life, two great characteristics of the missing actor.
Beyond a legendary career, a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a Hollywood-derived contestant is thus extinguished.
We're going to miss her face out on bottles of vinegar, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging her a choice of bad taste, though born as a gag.
However, the revenue of those sales was allocated to his Children's Foundation in difficulty.
Newman, instead of falling on his myth, chose to commit to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter saying "Always and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful to his good star.
To be there, it was a privilege."
And as much privilege was ours to follow the path of such a clear and generous American artist.
Citizen model, therefore, and much more.
What has been produced at the Zuchlag & Partner Invoice Factory?
The hearing of the criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and members will be discussed shortly on 8 October.
The political man and his associates are accused of repeated commercial fraud committed in the framework of an association to criminalize that has caused considerable damage, and of other crimes, including forgery of documents.
According to the Procura the money obtained by contest notices, was used by them for private purposes, and they have often certified the conduct of the activities through false invoices.
The state and municipal money, a total of 65 million florins, ended in part in the cases of the Fiatal Balldal organization, partly in the pockets of some people.
According to the method, made known by the investigating authorities, they took the money obtained by contest notices on the basis of invoices for non-existent transactions and associations never met their obligations.
According to the indictment, most of the invoices were false.
To make them, the invoice blocks were purchased at the Józsefváros market, the circular stamps instead were manufactured in Kiskunhalas.
And in order to decide on whose behalf the invoices were issued, it was established among other things during the trip between the hills above the Balaton where János Zuschlag had sent István Lados.
According to his confession he had to choose pensions and restaurants.
He asked for a bill for consumption, on the model of these, then the invoices to be submitted to competition notices, among others, to those of the Ministry for Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and the Municipality of Budapest were prepared.
Most of these are the work of István Lados and András, which, according to our information, has drawn up above all the reports needed to obtain funding.
One of Lados' "journey studies" was a brewery.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and partners in 2003, the restaurant provided meals for a group of 90 people from the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
So many people, however, as the restaurantman says, would not all enter the premises together.
Similarly, the invoice issued in summer 2002 to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, later called Együtt in Harmadik Évezredert, a stack of formal errors and content.
A Badacsonytomaj pension has only three rooms, more than 10 people could not stay overnight, but in the invoice there were 130 guests.
But the compilers of full-invented invoices went too far when they reported the Pigal Kft., also this one deals with catering, in whose accounts - according to the information given to the judicial authorities - did not even appear the documents on behalf of the companies Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá.
Győző Farkas, company administrator, told hvg.hu that when he was summoned to the prosecution and showed him the invoices, he immediately realized that these were false documents.
"I stamped the name and game Iva of our company was in the wrong place."
He added: in addition to the formal reasons he did not return the fact that according to the invoice a hundred people were accommodated, when in total they have eleven rooms and there are not so many beds.
By then the invoice was catering and their restaurant has been out of operation for a long time.
The assiduous invoice compilers did not worry to inform themselves that the Budapest travel agency of their choice, organizes only foreign travel, so they have foolishly indicated on the invoice with payment in cash travel in Hungary, which did not agree with the company's practice of issuing invoices.
In addition, as was shown during the investigation, VAT also included turnover, while travel to countries outside the European Union is exempt from VAT.
Among other things, the amount of VAT was wrong on the four documents issued by Hotel Revfülöp Kft. in favour of the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, in fact the services offered by the company must be applied to 15% and not to 25% as indicated on the invoices, and the hotel employees also issued only printed invoices, while the invoice manufactured was handwritten.
In addition to this, "issuers" have ruined other invoices, in the case of a company they have indicated as activities carried out goods by road, as is known from the proceeding of the Procurator, activities that were not carried out by the company originally founded by investment counseling.
Also due to formal defects - cause non-compliant invoice format, false stamp - it has been discovered that invoices issued in favor of Együtt to Harmadik Évezredert Alapitvány, of XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont are false.
The same happened in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Sport Field of Kunfehértó, whose representatives refused to issue the invoices in question.
The falsifiers paid no attention even to the fact that the HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was in liquidation when (2001) had lunched a group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület, precisely for this reason the editor of the liquidation of the company, according to our information, denied that he had issued that invoice.
They've released invoices knowingly
Another group of invoice issuers consists of those who were aware of having to issue fictional invoices.
The Foundation Esély Budapestért Alapitvány has issued an invoice at the request of Fiatal Balldal - Ifjú Szocialisták in favor of the Foundation Együtt in Harmadik Évezredert of almost 4 million florins.
Ludovic Györfi, one of the defendants, according to the indictment, persuaded Collab Kft's director to issue fictional invoices.
He also collaborated with Zuschlag and members of Biogate Kft currently in liquidation, which in 2003 provided invoices issued for a value of about 5 million florists to the Jobb Jövőért Alapitvány Foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület Association and the association Vörösfenyő Egyesület, behind which there was no real economic activity.
Not even money movement because the invoices prepared were then outsourced, but associations forgot to show this aspect in their documents.
In the following group of companies issuing invoices belong to those who are connected with the defendants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov, authorized by the Director General of the Delta Trió Kft, based in Budapest but not found there, which deals with the trade in fuel and motor vehicles.
The company released several invoices in October, November and December 2005 on the sale of computer media, worth about 18 million florins.
According to the survey, the Kiskunhalas Cash Investment Kft. under liquidation since 14 September 2005 purchased these invoices.
The Director-General of this company was a Romanian who, between 2002 and 2005, Ivan Kubatov had submitted the documents concerning the company.
As far as we know, Kubatov has acknowledged that he has released invoices on behalf of the company to Atlasz, Hoppá and Együtt at Harmadik Évesredért Alapitvány and the countervalue has been taken from him.
At the express request of Ivan Kubatov Romanian mowers founded Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
However, none of the companies were operational, because according to the defendant they had not received work.
However, it was useful for the companies because, at the request of the co-employer, Lawyer Zsolt Szente, editor of the company's founding documents, invoices were issued on behalf of the companies to the associations related to Zuschlag: the Atlasz and the Y-Genéració.
On behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade Kubatov has released 15 invoices to the various entities for a total value of 14.2 million florins.
The prosecutor considers that Kubatov has taxed 10% of the amounts reported on invoices, as well as Iva.
The man also used the Szi-Beri Bt. to issue fictitious invoices, manufactured for the competition ban of Biztos Pont.
Y-Genéració and Szövetség in Modern Magyarországért in January 2006 presented a ban for the public utility agency of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapitvány (TMA).
They also won 500,000 florins per head but the sums were not used for the purposes indicated in the ban.
So that this didn't come to a halt, they presented to the TMA five fictitious invoices received by the Works Team Kft.
These invoices were found during the search of the Kemecsei Árpád office at the Ministry of Education.
Some of the defendants, as they have already done in the public prosecutor's office, will probably report on the production of invoices.
However, the most interesting thing could be if the defendant number one, János Zuschlag, would decide to lift the veil on everything.
His confession so far has not been very detailed and even if he has promised several times to speak of everything in an extended manner, he has not yet done so.
You should see if it is in his interest, it might also be that the socialists have made agreements with Zusi, which - in exchange for a compensation of 50 million guilders, much of the damage - would be willing to do the scapegoat.
Zuschlag for the time being could also have offended himself, since his requests for relief from his prison conditions, namely the granting of house arrests, have not so far been exhausted.
While the perpetrators of non-reparable commercial crimes and causing much greater damage can freely walk or at least wait at home for the end of the proceedings against them, which is not granted to him.
The psychology of excessive bidding: why spend more money?
To auction buyers are willing to spend more, to overvalue the goods.
Neurologists and researchers from New York University have been able to discover the neuro-economic basis of this apparently irrational and known behavior.
According to their study on Science magazine, men don't want to stay back in a competition like eBay auction, so they're willing to pay even a higher price.
The research sought to trace the nervous pattern of this "game" to the nervous system level through experimental auctions.
A group of volunteers played the lot, the other group of players participated in an auction while using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) method examined the active areas of the brain of the participants in the experiment.
In both games the participants could win some money, but in the auction game, where the substantial element is to bid more than the other, the body crawled under the cerebral cortex enters intensively into operation when you lose the game.
This brain area, in addition to other functions, plays a role in the "self-gratification" mechanism of the nervous system.
So according to researchers, the rise of the price is explained by scanning the vehement reaction of the striated body.
To support their theory, the economists of the research group carried out a financial investigation.
In this survey, three groups have tendered against a partner under different conditions.
The control group reported the actual value of the product in question and they made their bet.
To another group besides this they promised that in the event of a win they would receive another $15 prize.
The third group would have received $15 before the auction, but the members of the group would have lost the money in case of a loss of the auction.
The difference between the two groups consisted of the fact that for one of them the win was highlighted, while for the other the loss.
By checking the hypothesis of neurologists the members of the group who played "against loss" were willing to make higher bets of the control group or "vincent".
"These results are not deductible from any of the previously existing economic theories.
In fact, so far these explained the phenomena found in auctions with the joy of winning and avoiding the risk.
Only the methods of creating the neurologic image have helped to resolve the contradiction between the two theories, so that we have reached a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, professor at the Faculty of Economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: when to contact your doctor?
Almost half a billion people in the world suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, but among the first causes of death chronic liver diseases are mentioned in Hungary.
In Hungary the number of hepatitis patients is 100 thousand, of which only 7000 are treated: the reason is that many patients do not know how to be infected.
Hepatitis is the collective name of contagious liver diseases caused by several viruses.
There are many similarities between the symptoms, typical are hepatitis and jaundice, but their pathogens and the diseases caused differ from one another.
Hepatitis viruses are spread in two main forms depending on the pathogenic agent: hepatitis A and E via the food channel (e.g., water and food), hepatitis B, C, D and other blood and organic fluid viruses (sperm, vaginal losses, saliva).
For those travelling it is useful to vaccinate against A and B virus, against C there is no vaccine.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after the consumption of infected foods, accompanied by general malaise, weakness, abdominal and nausea.
After yellow spots are formed on the skin and on the white of the eyes, the faeces become clear and the dark urine, the healing takes place within two to three weeks.
One million people die every year worldwide for hepatitis B, the most serious variant of the disease, which causes liver tumors and liver cirrhosis.
The main reason is estimated to be that only one in ten people receive pharmacological treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if it is not treated it can cause liver cirrhosis and liver tumors.
Most infected people do not know that they have contracted the disease because pathogens subdolately destroy liver cells, in many cases the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
Therefore, it is very important to prevent and carry out regular medical analysis.
This disease is much more frequent than the average in three groups: those who had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts and tattoos.
In the world today, the number of people infected with chronic hepatitis C virus amounts to 200 million.
As a routine laboratory examination also reveals the disease worth addressing to the family doctor when you notice any symptoms of unknown origin.
Recognised in time the disease is curable, the virus can be eliminated from the body, thus the infectious power ceases and the formation of tumors can be prevented.
September 30 is the world day of hepatitis, first organized in 2004 worldwide by sick associations.
The aim is to draw attention to viral chronic hepatitis, the causes of its development and the early recognition of the disease.
Who believes in God feels less pain?
According to the result of a recent survey, the religious faith functions as a kind of analgesic that has made the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
Scientists at Oxford University performed an interesting experiment, examining how faith in God influences the sensation of pain, the British Telegraph reported.
As part of the somewhat bizarre investigation, an electroshock was performed with 12 Catholic believers and the same atheists, while everyone observed a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
Based on the results, Catholic believers were able to reject much of the pain.
Thanks to the exploratory technique of the human brain it was discovered that Catholics were able to activate the part of the brain responsible for pain control.
The test is the first of a series of research in which, in addition to academics, scientists, philosophers and theologians of the University also take part.
The test was performed exactly like this: an instrument that emits discharges and passes the electroshock was connected to the left hand of the subject of the experiment.
The researchers asked the participants to focus on two paintings, the Virgin Mary painted in the 17th century by Sassoferrato and the Lady with the hermelin by Leonardo da Vinci painted in the 15th century.
The authors of the exam hoped that the image of the Virgin Mary originated a kind of religious state among believers, while Leonardo's picture was chosen because he did not differ too much from the other and considered it to be a reassuring effect.
The subjects of the experiment spent half an hour in front of the MRI scanner and at this time they received 20 electroshocks in four consecutive series, while they observed or the religious or other painting.
Catholics reported that the vision of the Virgin Mary made them feel "safe", as if "someone took care of themselves" and "they calmed down and they were pervaded by peace".
Looking at the image on a religious theme, they accounted for 12% in less pain than when Leonardo's work was before him.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who took part in the test himself, believes that such a result can be achieved with any image from the strong effect also for atheists, but you must find the right image.
"We need to look for an image to which they have very positive feelings, like a mother or father," said the psychologist.
The Anglican bishop Tom Wright welcomed the result of the search.
"The practice of faith should change, and in many cases it manages to change our personality." - Wright added.
After the excellent results only the question remains whether the painting of a Madonna of Leonardo or another painter of such a caliber is presented to the believers, what effect could it have on pain control?
Would the vision of a quality virgin Mary bring better results?
You're what you say about yourself.
On the tenth birthday Google can claim to be both in the pockets of people as well as in the sky above their heads; it knows where they spent their holidays, what ambulatory they attend and what they care about.
But this, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's directors, is not enough yet.
On the other hand, what concerns skeptics who compare with the Orwellian nightmare, they do not see the very substance of the web 2.0.
Recently Eric Schmidt told the Financial Times that Google's main goal is to collect as many personal data as its users and this is necessary to adhere to the original goal of Google's founders that it was: "we enter into a system all the information of the world!".
According to the Google director interviewed the company, after 10 years of revolutionary work, it is still at the beginning of being able to manage all the information.
To the question what will happen in five years Schmidt replied: he would like if Google could answer questions like "what do I do tomorrow?" or "what would be the job for me?", but the software can't answer apparently simple questions because they don't know enough about users.
Not all Internet users are aware that during their internet searches exactly the search words, from which IP address are searched and on which page the interested persons stop after the search.
Through the Personalized Search started two years ago users e.g. can memorize their browsing history, they may concern what they have looked for and clicked, they will generate far better results in the long run; on this same logic we base Recommendations with which the system offers us products and services according to our previously declared and registered preferences.
What if my data is being used against me, if they look at what I'm dealing with? - worried users are asked about Google's data monopoly.
In most cases, the counter-reactions of the defendants are caused by the fear proved by the size of the potential power represented by the firm, not by the sense of guilt, by the fear of punishment, by the desire for freedom or even by the rebellion to power.
One fact is, however, confirmed that all the expressions sought are not only recorded but in justified cases can also be provided to third parties, in such legal cases nothing defends the personal rights of the defendants.
The most striking example of this in recent times was perhaps the coordinated action against the pedophiles of Brazil, in which Google forwarded to the Brazilian government the information that made it possible to identify pedophiles from the Orkut community page maintained by Google.
Interested inmates on personal rights instead sighed of relief in May when the company - in agreement with the EFF legal protection association - successfully demonstrated the truth in court against the FBI: not even afterwards can Google be forced with any point of the constitution to provide any information requested by the FBI secretly.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully removed almost 50,000 web addresses and a thousand research expressions obtained in connection with the confirmation of the child protection law approved years earlier, but nevertheless failed to obtain the search lists of individual users and the entire list of web pages and keywords dating back to two months.)
So Google's judgment is quite contradictory: those who fear to provide their personal data are talking about Google because they believe that this is the way their intimate sphere and private life are being compromised by starting to use the services and rise with the rebellion on multinationals that stand out for the conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and the proliferation of fans, activists and computer users appearing in many countries see in them the future generation of large companies, the "cool corporation", unlike their rival, Microsoft liquidated as a conqueror of the world because of Windows, although both are fighting for the same goal.
This may happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for an identification code, does not ask for money for its services, the source code kept always up to date and the program package is much more accessible, young and cool than the official software colossus practice.
But it can also happen because the geeks see exactly the problematic relationship between personal rights and the internet, which implies just one of the key words repeated more often in recent years, the web 2.0.
The web 2.0 speaks only of collaboration, of intentionally leaving traces behind us and exploiting the communication channels at our disposal and while the size of these changes for each individual, the substance is the same: to show ourselves.
A young media can create profiles in more community pages, from Facebook to Xanga, can connect them with other services such as Twitter or last.fm that lists its musical tastes, all of which can be inserted into systems like FriendFeed or Blip.fm, can also write blogs on which automatically appear its most recent photo galleries stored on Flickr or Picasa.
In the meantime, we read many exemplary cases from which it becomes clear that the girl, seeing the series of photos taken in the morning from the common tour of friends, easily comes to know with those who spent the night her perfidious boy or a firm can fire a employee because she has written a sincere opinion on the company summit: one thing is sure, the concept of private life has now been completely reconsidered.
Those who live an online life do so to show themselves and so we can formulate the fundamental thesis that is hidden behind the behavior of young people.
Anyone who wants to hide something or just want to avoid Google's monopoly can do so (starting with Scroogle using Google's search system but at the same time does not voluntarily leave traces).
There are few people who don't register on purpose to community pages for not to be found, Google's online applications, from writing to managing images and collecting news, can be replaced with alternative versions that are not linked to huge servers and that do not make up our best existing profile so far.
Public opinion doesn't even wait in secret for the moment when Google will pull out the claws.
Currently the company with its $156 billion worth worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel(124 billion) or Coca Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising spaces threaten the revenues of advertising agencies, services introduced in record time cause serious damage not only to Microsoft but also to many software development companies.
However, the critical observers next to all this find some alarming points: for example, the corporate summit completely rejected the employee protest after doubling the company's right to asylum, considered it too expensive the repeated catering to the employee's daily pleasure, but all this decreases in view of the fact that in 2006 Google closed the head to the Chinese government and, in accordance with their agreement, the company will filter all the results that offend the good taste and interests of the Chinese regime.
An internal regulation of the company seems to be not to advertise a new service in advance but only when it is usable, one thing is certain, that the foreseeable problems of the next few months and years will move the world at a point: while some believe that Google's project of scanning and storage of books and magazines will assume proportions such that the company will soon be faced by the US Supreme Court, others are afraid of the health system, in fact in this we can create our health profile with our reports, doctors and problems.
The fact that Google is building a genetic database can offer good material to the next generation of fantasy writers, the story Scroogled of the famous Cory Doctorow describes the future with orwellian accents, in which a man with Google data can be approached in an alarming manner.
Two minors helped Ózd's double homicide to make the tracks disappear
The police questioned two minors about the double murder of Ozd, who were suspected of having helped to make the traces of the crime disappear - said on Tuesday the spokesperson for the Police Affairs of the Borsod region.
The young people have acknowledged the offence to their defendants, and are currently accused of favour.
The two minors, two girls according to MTI information, defend themselves on a free foot.
The favor is punishable up to 5 years of imprisonment.
The suspect of the double murder of Ozd, a 23-year-old man of the place, Sunday was put in pre-trial detention.
It is suspected of premeditated homicide committed for profit.
From the survey it turned out that the young twenty-one had a big debt with a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to settle the debt, so last Wednesday he lured his creditor into a Ózd yard where he and his 9-year-old daughter killed.
According to MTI information the young man had prepared to commit the crime, a signal is that he committed the murder with a weapon hidden on the spot.
The police are examining the weapon and the circumstances of use with the involvement of an expert.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange made an offer for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered 200 million euros, about 5 billion Czech crowns, for the purchase of 100% of the listed shares of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer advanced by the Poles even though the blind had previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange as possible buyer of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for the exclusion is the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is owned by the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state which intends to sell over a few months more than 60% of its securities.
The Czech financial newspaper E15 states that the Polish offer represents the highest figure so far advanced for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press so far, they have presented an offer to the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the German Stock Exchange.
Petr Koblic, director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among all concerned the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst owner and did not exclude that this could lead in the future to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange in 5-10 billion crowns.
According to the shareholders' agreement almost 90% of the securities would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Country Finance with a share of almost 25%, followed by Banca Česká Spořitelna with 14.7% and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5%
The economic crisis from the point of view of European newspapers
The main European newspapers in their Tuesday comments on the international economic crisis are already talking about "a second September 11".
The global financial disaster has taken place thanks to the American President - he accuses La Repubblica - who has not been able to compact his party behind a fast-boggling law, whose aim is to remedy a desperate situation.
Instead of a second Pearl Harbour, as the billionaire superfinancer Warren Buffett said, it would be more accurate to speak of a second September 11.
Also part of the Madrid press sees the scapegoat in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of American political leadership has cast the world economy on the edge of the cheap.
More and more the danger of the collapse of the American financial system is growing, and this will eventually affect the whole world.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but as a result of the Congress's vote, there is the danger that Washington will not provide a political means of managing the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air, just when the greatest transformation of the history of capitalism is taking place.
It is no longer possible to release the threat - mention the Tags-Anzeiger of Geneva.
Some states today can still offer a lifesaver to the financial institutions and taxpayers' money can save them from failure.
But if more and more banks collapse as in a domino effect then it will no longer be sufficient either the financial means or new, improvised solutions.
In the long term, it is necessary for the Member States of the European Union to overcome their national selfishness and concentrate control on the financial markets which are dismembered.
Only on Monday have weak financial institutions obtained more than 100 billion euros - recall the Viennese Der Standard, according to which it seems more and more real the anxieties that European taxpayers, like American taxpayers, will have to put their portfolio into their hands to remedy the crisis.
The EU has so far not been very concerned about the crisis that has gone through the old continent as a tsunami.
The "savers" must not immediately destroy the EUR 100 billion, however it would be better if they set out in which case it is appropriate to touch taxpayers' money to prevent greater damage.
The intelligent machine imitates the flight of the scumbag
What could be the best way to develop anti-collision technologies if not to imitate the sensors of the obstacles in nature?
Like bees.
In the surprising project presented to CEATEC in Japan, the Calabrians gave the initial strategic direction to the Nissan engineers on how to build the next generation of anti-collision systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo the Nissan built the biomimetic robot BR23C, a robotized mini-auto with bee properties, with the ultimate aim of creating a system able to scan all collisions.
Flying the bees form a personal oval space that really resembles our protective shield - explained to the exhibition Kazuhiro Doi, director of the PR technology sector and research and development.
Important is the role of the view of the ape, capable of a view of 300 degrees in each direction.
The engineers attracted the telemetric laser idea to copy the function of the ape view.
The BR23C detects the obstacles up to two meters away within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance and sends a signal to the microprocessor on board that immediately transforms it into a command to avoid collision.
In a fraction of second the robot perceives the obstacle and then, imitating the movements of the water, changes direction immediately by turning the wheels of the measure necessary to avoid the accident.
This avoidance maneuver, unlike the current system, is carried out in a completely instinctive way.
"If that weren't the robot car wouldn't react quickly to avoid collisions" - explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robot car project.
It must react instinctively and immediately because this technology corresponds to the harmful and more internal layer of the protective shield, within which the collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what makes a bee to avoid the other bees.
This process must take place in an eyebrow.
But unlike bees the deviation cannot go up or down or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional and in the direction of steering the wheels.
In this way instead of the infinite possibilities available to bees to scan the other bees, the robot, as available, can rotate on itself, accelerate and slow down.
BR23C is powered by batteries to lithium polymers, lighter and high energy density, which means that their duration is higher than lithium ions.
According to Andoh, the instantness of the intelligent reaction is important, not the processing of data or even less the ability to store them.
This robot needs to process some input in a few seconds and react.
There is no need to memorize them and react with intuitive logic based on previous maneuver data, so it uses only a memory of a few tens of Kb.
There's no need for a gigabyte or megabyte memory.
This is the first step towards the development of a technology for the immediate avoidance of collisions that, they predict to Nissan, within 10 years can be installed on serial vehicles.
Further possibility of application can be represented by unification with GPS satellite navigation system that avoids obstacles on the road leading to destination.
They also found the name to the very expensive child
The written version of the $700 billion economic rescue law for the purchase of disproportionate credits has been drafted, to be applied in several parts.
In the first passage half of the sum is spent.
In the new agreements protracted up to midnight on Saturday according to the Eastern Coast time the leaders of the Congress decided the $700 billion rescue plan after a debate that lasted for days - Reuters reported.
We have made serious progress - said Nancy Pelossi, Democratic President of the House of American Representatives, that it was only left to put the deal on paper.
Both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain, supported the compromise of the plan.
The Treasury Minister Henry Paulson, speaking of the outcome of the compromise, said that the programme will work and will be effective, but there is still a lot to do. According to Pelossi, it is not about saving Wall Street but about investing the economic car.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of Asian markets at 8 p.m. according to Washington's time (2 p.m. on Monday p.m. according to Central Europe's time), but did not bring a great growth of the stock exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will vote for the first draft defined Economic Stabilization Act 2008 concerning the program, after which it will be the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to the Pelossi on Saturday evening, then joyfully welcomed the news of the agreement to the White House.
We are pleased with the progress made this evening and very much appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilise our financial markets and defend the economy - said Tony Fratto spokesperson of the White House.
However, the programme differs from the original proposal of the Bush administration, which provided that the $700 billion would be spent all on the purchase of securities with disproportionate loans behind it.
Now as a first step you can spend at most half the sum of 700 billion dollars, 250 billion immediately after the vote on Monday of the Congress, with these the Treasury Ministry will acquire securities with disproportionate loans behind it, the fate of the remaining 100 billion dollars will decide the president.
A special college will monitor the program to which the President of the Federal Reserve also participates.
The expenditure of the other half of the 700 billion depends on a new Congress decree.
Under the law, the Treasury Ministry can apply a combined tactic: it can buy at the same time credits, mortgages and securities with mortgages and other types of "veiled" credit.
The purchase can come through auctions and directly - they have announced competent ministry.
The legal standard makes it possible for the companies concerned to take part in an insurance program where the Treasury Ministry guarantees the means that cause concern, for which companies will pay an appropriate price for the likely damage.
Henrz Paulson said: the law provides the means for 700 billion dollars to arrive at the urgent needs of the American monetary system, whether it is the purchase of wrong financial means, their insurance or to avoid the risk of the collapse of a large financial institution.
We will take all necessary steps to make us ready to introduce the law as soon as it has signed - it has added.
The directors of the banks in crisis and awaiting state aid think instead that the government will limit their goodwill, defined by the overseas slang simply as golden parachutes.
Limitations of payments will only take place in a few cases, and limitations also depend on how the Treasury Ministry will offer aid.
In essence, the limitation means that if the ministry acquires under an auction, it will impose an overcrowding on the golden parachute, if they do not retire the director of the deceased bank.
At the time of the direct purchase of disproportionate loans, the government will act aggressively to ensure that the directors' money is not exaggerated.
To this it should be added that the existing contracts of the gold parachute will not change, the limitation is only valid for new ones to encourage participation in the programme.
This is the first case in the American history of the entry into force of a legal limitation concerning the remuneration of the general administrators - the democratic Barney Frank chairman of the committee responsible for the financial services of the House of Representatives commented on the measure.
In addition to this, the state has the right to appropriate a share of the banks participating in the programme, reducing the risk of taxpayers, since they can also earn us if the economy, and together with it, the bank saved, will stand up.
The bill includes that in the next five years the President must submit to Congress a proposal which provides for the return of the expected losses from the financial sector to taxpayers.
Of course, on both sides there were those who expressed their doubts about the project.
This is not what American citizens have asked us not to defend taxpayers' dollars - said the Republican MP of California Darrell Issa.
His Democratic colleague at Ohio Mary Kaptur believes that the measures have been taken by the same people who are responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

Next year in the United States without a visa?
Kinga Göncz sees the possibility of the US-Hungarian visa exemption agreement to enter into force on 12 January - the Foreign Minister spoke about this in Chicago with the Hungarian representatives of the place.
According to his opinion, "everything now depends on the fact that the electronic input and control system is built in time".
However, he drew attention to the fact that in the new system there will no longer be the entry permit, but before the departure the tourists will have to be registered.
The Hungarian diplomat will continue today's negotiations in Washington.
He will meet with Foreign Minister Condoleeza Rice, to whom he will hand over the medal of the Hungarian Order Cross with Stella, and he will hold talks with foreign policy advisers from Democratic candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and John McCain also joined in favor of the bank rescue plan
Barack Obama and John McCain, candidates for the presidency of the two major American parties, assured Sunday their support for the $700 billion government plan for bank rescue, but there are politicians who demand the resignation of the Treasury Minister.
The representatives of Congress and Administration after the marathon negotiations lasted for days, Sunday night announced that they had reached an agreement in principle on the bank rescue plan.
The Wall Street crisis and the financial package for the release of frozen credits have become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain want to be more suitable than their rival to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls with the focus of economic issues Obama has recovered a little bit of advantage, while McCain's advantage, obtained after the Republican Convention with Sarah Palin's vice president's appointment, has disappeared.
Obama in a speech to Detroit expressed the hope that the Congress would quickly approve the $700 billion plan law.
He stressed that the proposal contained those steps of consumer protection which were also supported by him.
"Now we must act responsibly (...), the danger threatens your work, your savings, all the industrial sectors, the complete economic stability" - he said in front of a crowd of 35,000 people.
He didn't let himself escape from defining over McCain's economic ideas.
McCain in an interview with the ABC explained that "all we're going to send down with difficulty this situation (...) but doing nothing is not a road to go."
The Republican Senator has reported that in the proposal there is the creation of a supervisory committee of the Minister of Finance and the limitation of the good outputs of the top managers, which he has insisted on.
Obama told the CBS that McCain had no merit in the agreements, but he was in daily contact with the minister.
President Nancy Pelosi reported on Sunday that the House of Representatives will probably vote on the bill on Monday.
German-speaking world press review
The pole of the right is intact, only within the pole the voters have become more self-conscious - thus analyzes Der Spiegel the weak result of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider's party is ready to rule Austria to prevent the black-red coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
Franz Walter, in the Internet edition of the German magazine on the left, in the article The Bavarian Revolution devours its parents analyze the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known politician, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber couple took over.
The Christian-social have remodeled Bavaria for decades and right now these modern citizens are moving away from them.
The change of time is at the same time a problem of all Christian democracy, so also of Angela Merker.
The defeat was not a big surprise for the CSU, but on Sunday it ended a process that exactly ten years ago had been feasible: the undisputed hegemony of a state-state party ended.
Already 10 years ago, in 1998, the CSU had dropped to 47.7%, for the first time under the 50% threshold since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago at the Bundestag elections in 2005 again in the period of the so-called Stoiber.
This is the result of the modernization in the region, which devours parents.
The sociologists have predicted it 40 years ago, but they have made a long mistake. But secularization, educational results, settlement of the East and North Germans in the developed Bavarian region could not remain without consequences on the faithfulness of the voters to the CSU.
Modernisation goes hand in hand with increasing possibilities and the political consequences are evident.
The pole of the right is intact, only inside the pole the voters have become more self-conscious, critical, stubborn.
It is also surprising that in recent weeks the classic bourgeois groups, free professionals, craftsmen, diplomats and graduates, have moved away from the CSU.
Here CSU support has fallen below 40%.
Die Presse (dipresse.com)
The conservative newspaper "Who with whom?" In the article "The party presidents are stuck in coalition issues" deals with the confusing internal Austrian political situation created following the elections.
SPÖ intends to deal with ÖVP.
ÖVP prohibits SPÖ's intervention in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to negotiations in all directions, the greens still do not want to discuss coalition.
The elections have been made, now rotates around the coalition; in the discussion broadcast by the TV the leaders of the parties have just shown the cards.
Werner Faymann President of SPÖ confirmed that he wants to deal with ÖVP.
SPÖ wants to demonstrate that collaboration between the two parties, in some regions and in social partnership already exists.
Faymann left open the question if he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Moltererer, the current president of ÖVP, as vice-canceller.
As he said, the Schüssel-Molterer course was rejected in any case.
The repetition of this direction is not considered.
Molterer reacted prudently to red offerings.
As he said, collaboration will certainly not succeed if Faymann tries to interfere with ÖVP's internal affairs.
If your party chooses the opposition or enters the coalition is still an open thing in the party, the issues must be discussed in any case within ÖVP.
Jörg Haider leader of BZÖ repeated being open in all directions.
"To prevent the Red-Black coalition we are ready to assume our responsibility to rule," Haider said.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, in Paris, the European Summit for Equal Opportunities started, organised this year by France with the European Union's rotating presidency.
Lívia Járóka, MP Fidesz of the European People's Party in the message addressed to the Plenum as the main rapporteur of the Congress, drew attention to the school segregation because it is the most serious legal violation that affects Roma children and to come the most serious obstacle to their affirmation.
Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, on behalf of the French Presidency, and European Commissioner Vladimir Špidla responsible for employment, social affairs and equal opportunities, opened the conference at the highest level.
Among the invitations to the conference were governments, European social partners and representatives of major European civil and rights-defence organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
Járóka, according to the press office of the Fidesz EP parliamentary group, pointed out, in addition to discrimination in recruitments, that Roma are being evicted from the labour market in the first place because of their low education.
"Most Roma young people do not have the title of medium-level studies and as a result of elementary teaching of poor quality only an indirect number of them can achieve a higher degree of study."
Járóka also stressed, as a fundamental human right, the key role of education in upholding human rights.
Investing in the education of Roma children can mean strengthening the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the honourable Member, it is necessary to make them aware in the wider context of Roma and non-Roman links.
In fact, as soon as a Roma school begins, the more its chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market are increased; through taxes paid for income and consumption contribute to the nation's budget.
"The right of European citizenship of Roma must guarantee their right to quality education and the elimination of low-level and segregated schools" - said Lívia Járóka.
According to the honourable Member, the union of purpose and action of the European Union is necessary to speed up the process of disintegration of schools, and that is why it is essential that the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives are properly respected.
"The vicious cycle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be halted, Roma children must be given the opportunities provided by the democratic space so that they can contribute as citizens to the future of Europe" - Járóka asked.
In the sign of the "European Year of Equal Opportunity" to be guaranteed for all, the purpose of the European Summit for Equal Opportunities organized each year, from the Berlin meeting last year, is to ensure a single forum to promote the goals of anti-discrimination and equal opportunities set at the state and European level.
CSU: pity for a transitional period
At the end of October, the lucky Huber-Beckstein couple will decide.
Although the bad election defeat has not yet fallen the heads, at the summits of the Bavarian CSU the discussion of personal matters has been postponed for the time being.
The chairman of the party Erwin Huber and the regional governor Günther Beckstein still remain in their place, the question is until the mercy lasts.
The fate of the tandem that has suffered a catastrophic loss of votes of 17% will decide the party's extraordinary congress on the last weekend of October.
The two highly criticized politicians have in any case made known that they are not attached to the chair with all the forces.
They have tried to soften the angry members of the parliamentary group and the basis that one day after the Bavarian Tsunami claimed the personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
5 years ago, under the guidance of Edmund Stoiber then at the height of his career, the Christian-social Union obtained 60.7%, now after the coup d'état against Stoiber fell to 43.4%.
The CSU for 46 years was "absolute monarch" in Bavaria which gives 18% of the German GDP.
However, conservatives in the southern region are always of fundamental importance to the Hungarian economy, and in the future they will be forced to stick together anyway.
As a first signal of the reorganization within the party, the Deputy President and Federal Minister of Horst Seehofer Agriculture, considered possible heir to Huber, gets a place in the small exploratory group that will start negotiations with the FDP liberals and with the Free Electors exponent right values for a possible government coalition in Munich.
For a strange joke of fate on the list of Free Electors enters the legislature that Gabriel Pauli whose attitude against Stoiber had been exploited as an opportunity to strike by the Huber-Beckstein couple and then treat the woman without regard to the great ambitions.
CSU leaders now concentrate all their forces to stabilize in some way Beckstein.
Meanwhile, Stoiber will also be playing an active role, which so far has been in the shadow. The former regional governor and former president of the CSU has defined September 28th the most bitter day of his political career.
Monday Huber issued some statements to the faithful towards the CSU, which would have deserved more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
Merkel will not be able to be Chancellor after the Bundestag elections established for September 2009 if the CSU, which played a decisive role in the 2005 national victory, will not be set up with common forces.
According to Merkel, which does not hide the disappointment for the fiasco, the loss of land of the CSU will not negatively affect the great coalition of Berlin.
What is certainly relative: it will not be easy to manage the wounded CSU, the crisis of social democrats still lasts.
The SPD achieved its lowest result since 1946 in Bavaria with 18.6%.
Lukashenko-opposition: 110-0
Not even a representative of the opposition entered the Belarusian Parliament after the Sunday elections.
According to Russian observers it is the sign of the well-being and stability assured in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) instead it is explained with the broilers committed in counting the votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the elections.
Although the legislation of 110 people from a country of 10 million inhabitants has been lacking in opposition for more than a decade, before yesterday's elections the opposition under the name United Democratic Forces (OSD) seriously hoped that Lukashenko, with the presidential mandate renewed for the fourth time following the constitutional change to the 2006 elections, was discussed in circumstances, "conceded" some seats in Parliament to representatives of the opposition.
The ODS thus gave up a previously assessed boycott.
Behind the expectations of the opposition was that Belarus, increasingly economically dependent on Russia, which called for a credit to reduce the import of ever more expensive Russian natural gas and agreed to give Russian gas pipelines in possession of Beltransgaz that pass through the country, intended to improve the relationship with the EU where Lukashenko and other top-ranking politicians cannot enter into the Belarusian anti-democratic political situation.
It referred to a distancing that the OSCE, evaluating the electoral campaign, has put the emphasis on positive movements rather than failures, such as the prohibition on presenting itself for a third of the opposition candidates.
The OSCE's quick Monday report, however, also criticised the campaign, during which the opposition candidates could not appear on the press, and in particular that the opposition could not be present at the counting of votes.
Despite this opposition, an improvement in the political climate is noticeable: political prisoners have been released, Minsk is also ready for a small confrontation with Moscow, continuing to deny recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia from Georgia, even though Russia, with which Belarus forms a federal state on paper, considers the two countries independent for a month.
We have made two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun - said to our newspaper Aleksandr Milinkevich.
According to the presidential candidate for the 2006 election opposition, it is desirable that he remain, despite the fact that "the power has been afraid to bring even one opposition into a dutyless Parliament".
The opposition does not provide for protest actions for the results but rather proves that the message of the need for economic reform comes to the voters.
Of course we have many problems, we have to print the opposition papers in Russia, for distribution the local authorities raise difficulties, but I also see that more and more people support change, including among the elderly - Milinkevich said that not even the official aid, that of pensioners, considers the Lukashenko regime appropriate, which considers its main result to be the creation of social security.
Due to the indebtedness of the country and the increase in economic deficit, it is only a matter of time that the breakdown of social security "remembering sepulchre silence" - Milinkevich considers.
Unlike the opposition politician, the Russian observers considered the elections democratic.
Sergej Lebedev President of the Community Independent States told the Russian press agency RIA Novosti: "Men believe not in words but in facts", so the lack of opposition is but proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on breakfast before work"
It has never happened in the history of Palazzo Chigi that there were swirling doors for the entry and exit of employees.
But from today take this new measure against the smarts, against those who stamp and then go to drink a coffee at the bar in working hours.
The anti-fannulloni novelty was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary-General of the Council Presidency, Mauro Masi.
"The swivel doors - says Brunetta - are a tool for working better, with more productivity, more attendance and more services" the minister says.
"Now a new season of responsibility and transparency opens.
This is reformism," Brunetta adds.
With Palazzo Chigi completes the installation in all the buildings of the Presidency of the Council.
For Masi "the choice of swivel doors is also important from a symbolic point of view".
There has been no resistance from employees, the Secretary-General assures: "It has been a process shared by the workers and there has been the collaboration of everyone".
I mean, no more breakfast at work time; no more coffee and cornnet.
Brunetta's speech, which suggests, smiling, "a beautiful cappuccino at 7 a.m. is a holy hand."
During a conference at the Higher School of Public Administration
in Rome, the minister then notes that "in three months the absences for illness of public employees have reduced by 50%, i.e. 60 thousand more people at work in one year".
And it adds that it is necessary to make Public Administration more efficient
Italian, "whose wage dynamics - explains the minister - over the last 8-10 years have been double compared to the private sector and well above inflation rates".
Meanwhile, thousands of public employees have joined together to challenge the rules of the Brunetta Decree by adhering to the appeal supported by the Codacons.
"While the minister of the Public Service will now banish numbers about the lesser absenteeism at work because of disease - the association of consumers - the people of the 'operous fonulullions' is constantly growing.
In fact, in Italy there are thousands of employees of the correct and productive public administration who have united to declare war on the illegal rules contained in the decree."
In particular, the Tar will contest the exclusion of additional economic treatments due to illness dependent on the cause of service; the extension of the hours of the recoverability of the sick worker, where the inspection visits are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions sought by the Minister.
Incidents at work, Napolitano: "Criminal prevention"
Every day, in Italy, 2,500 accidents occur at work, 3 people die and 27 remain permanently disabled.
For 2007, Inail data confirm that the white deaths were approximately 1,200.
Figures that testify to the severity of a phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of death and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
In order to draw the attention of institutions, social forces and the media to this dramatic issue, Anmil celebrates the 58th National Day for the victims of accidents at work, which was set up on the second Sunday of October, today in all the provinces of Italy.
"The worrying data from Anmil and the same tragic chronics of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is," said President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the President of Anmil, National Association mutilated and disabled at work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his "expressed appreciation for the ongoing partnership commitment to the prevention of workplaces, the protection of injured workers, the assistance of the families of victims and the awareness of public opinion".
"There has, of course, been an outraged 'sufficient', sincerely shared, in the face of tragedies that, because of their size, arouse the clamor of the media and the involvement of public opinion, but the daily reality presents us with dramatic, even repetitive cases in their dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly also a problem of resources: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
Particularly significant is the many initiatives promoted in the school environment for a more direct awareness by young people who are facing the world of work.
It is important to keep the focus on the phenomenon alive, not to weaken in the alarm of its social gravity, to apply and improve legislation.
The president of the Gianfranco Fini Chamber pointed out "as the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each of us and imposes a firm commitment on all institutions to urgently end it".
"The accident data at work seems to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not prevent the number of white deaths from being impressive," said the president of Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
"We do not want this "tendence to fall" to translate into less attention, because it is precisely when attention is slowed down that the tragedy explodes.
"We believe that at the general level it is still too little to counter the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be exercised through multiple actions.
We believe it is necessary - Mercandelli has stressed - more controls and inspections, but also stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this from the world of school."
"It serves a further effort - it has added - with regard to communication and awareness-raising of public opinion.
But above all, it needs a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli then denounced "the progressive deterioration of the levels of compensation provided for victims of work" and "the ancillary drift towards which the system has been moving in recent years".
"The objective is therefore to return to the worker the insurance guarantee - he added - because the fate of those who are injured should not depend on spontaneisms or enlargement from time to time arranged by the legislator."
Mp3 readers under charge, risk hearing
Listening to high-volume music for an extended period of time using portable musical devices such as MP3 players can cause permanent hearing injuries.
It is reported by the European Commission that in a communication published in Brussels, it cites the opinion of the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Recently Identifyed Health Risks (Crsseri) of the EU, published today.
"From this scientific opinion - it is read in the note - it appears that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable musical devices weekly for more than an hour per day having the high volume apparatus risk a permanent loss of hearing ability."
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable musical devices and mobile phones at high sound levels can unconsciously damage their hearing in an irreparable way," says Meglena Kuneva.
"From scientific findings - the EU leader continues - there is a clear risk and we have to react quickly.
What matters most, we need to raise awareness and make this information public.
We also need to re-examine existing control systems, in the light of this scientific opinion, in order to make them fully effective and keep pace with the new technology."
Brussels had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the large use of portable musical devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise they originated.
"Scientists - the EU executive concludes - confirm that there is cause for concern and the European Commission will now examine together with the Member States and interested parties what measures might be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable musical devices and related equipment".
At present, there is already a European security standard that limits to 100 dB the noise level of portable musical equipment, but there are growing concerns about hearing damage that may result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to limit these damage by using solutions such as reduction of levels and duration of noise exposure.
In its opinion, the EU Scientific Committee notes that users of portable musical equipment if they listen to music at high volume (more than 89 decibels) for only 5 hours per week exceed the currently in force limits on the maximum permitted noise at the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity after a period of 5 years.
This would affect 5-10% of the users of these devices and their number can be quantified between 2.5 million and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, German gives way to the Commission for the future of the capital
Today we start, in March we close, in June we will get the sums.
This is the calendar set by the Campidoglio for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capital", which settled this morning in its new headquarters behind the Terme di Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will develop the guidelines for Rome.
Once the members are closed in March, the Junta and the Municipal Council will evaluate analyses and projects, so that they can present in June the strategic plan for Rome with the "official ball" of the Campidoglio and his mayor Gianni Germano.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and there have been all the political, social and cultural ideas - it is important to stress German - it will have to provide proposals for a development idea of Rome, of which political decision-makers, who remain the Junta and the Municipal Council, will then be able to make use of.
There is no overlap of roles but only the will to have a place where to draw up a great project for Rome.
In March he will finish his work and then dissolve, because this experience must have a precise time term.
In June - announces the mayor - we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of Rome Capital".
Those who accuse the Commission of worthlessness, since their opinions will not be binding, German replied: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and the quality of its proposals.
If quality is there, as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am sure also in Rome, its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics is falling apart on the management of daily life and on the emergencies that sometimes arise.
On the contrary, we want to look longer and further, in a deeper perspective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future."
Moreover, the mayor of Rome wishes to point out that "this Commission is neither a useless institution nor a body: it is absolutely free, it will not cost a euro to the Roman citizens and will serve to reason and involve the best intelligence that expresses the Capital".
For German, in fact, "it is necessary to have a strategic reference design, not closed or immobili, to allow our city to make a genuine leap of level, of which it absolutely needed, thinking in a spirit unitary to its future".
A future which, the mayor of Rome specifies, "will not be limited to the present municipal boundaries but will look far beyond" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as Capital but also "in view of the role that Rome can and must play as the Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama, the first anti-American president.
He wrote a well-known American politician who keeps us going independently: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, with his decisions, decimated the U.S. economy and had relations (as he is also today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam."
Attacks against Obama are increasing just as the election date is approaching.
He wrote a Miami lady on a web site: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a big hard face: he thinks he will win the highest position of a nation that has had two governors and five black senators in all!"
They are actually attacks that don't say much; they are clearly racial attacks and they don't answer the voters' question: will it be a good president? Then there are the polls; they all say that Obama will win and with a good detachment.
In this case too, there are people who talk with the heart but not with the brain.
A newspaper of the Mississippi, in the viscera of the south of the United States, wrote an editorial: once in the booth to vote we know well who will give his vote the American patriot.
It comes out one side of the American mentality kept covered up to the last.
"Say what you want, then we'll figure out where to put the cross, whether about Obama or McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama is to win, we're going to leave America.
What has never been said before, which almost certainly shows the success of the black candidate.
However, despite all these reasonings, the winning weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
They asked 1500 people: what were the mistakes made by Bush during his term of office? 89 percent responded: Iraq.
Change America.
In Vietnam this nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and was sent home to kicks in the ass.
In Iraq there are 4500 soldiers who lost their lives and Americans were not forced to pack.
Yet, Iraq for the majority was Bush's weak point.
Whoever takes George W's place will have a huge task to do.
Use, the economic shock is also felt on journalists: in newspapers it is time to cut. And many people blame the internet, "murder" of the printed paper.
Fifty hundred American journalists were questioned by the PEW Research Center on the state of their profession and mental control of the future.
Well, journalists today are almost all pessimistic about their future.
However, the newsmen did not openly say that they felt less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like once.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a destroyed economic model crisis.
Moreover, the cuts made in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work to put the newspapers together, is a big problem.
It is a problem that needs to be solved, according to journalists interviewed, if it is not to be expected that traditional journalism as the general public intends to do is substantially shrinking.
A clear but complex pessimism pervades the American journalist today.
Six out of ten newspapermen and executive seniors are convinced that journalism at national level is following a wrong path.
In the local field, the executive group is 65%.
Printed against broadcast.
It's not hard for journalists to see where the web is going.
The biggest publishing houses open up to the Internet, for many views as the "killer" of the printed paper.
The "economic pressure" of journalists has increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted that they are embracing technology in the hope that "doing something good" for their journalism.
The biggest gap today in American journalism is between those who run the newsrooms - i.e. the directors - and the reporters who work for them.
56% of executives at national level are sure that their reporters divide their values, while at local level the percentage falls to 23%.
For some this has to do with "work security".
Executives who think they lose their jobs over 3 years are 47% at national level.
For the staff reporters, it goes to 30%.
That of the "safe work" at the staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work with a contract.
In an immense nation like the USA, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the internet employers often offer what they want and thus become a question of "take it or leave it", taking or leaving.
The directors receive almost always high salaries, while the editor can earn even 10 thousand dollars a month, as well as pension and payment of insurance.
For holidays, then, reasoning becomes complicated: every day after the first year, all after the third to reach 15 days overall after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, for their admission, often get sick during the year.
It's all about climate.
UNIPOL: TRIBUNAL ROMA, DANILO COPPOLA RESTA A GROTTAFERRATA
The president of the second criminal section of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the instance of the realtor Danilo Coppola who had asked to be able to move from his town, Grottaferrata, to a home in the city of Rome.
Coppola is investigated for bankruptcy in the context of the Unipol-Bnl counterpath investigation.
In the course of the proceedings at his disposal last week, he obtained the discharge from the domicile transformed into an obligation of residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the realtor be able to travel from the town of province to a home in the capital.
However, according to the court, these displacements (which he gave an opinion against the pm) would allow him to influence his company and access the evidence that they accuse him of.
Elelites in Danger
The phenomenon had already occurred a few days ago with the vote of the House of Representatives against the $700 billion rescue plan launched by the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and is, more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
There is a confirmation from the New York Times of yesterday that the ongoing crisis is breaking the Republican Party, increasingly divided between its old East Coast soul, moderate, favorable to federal institutions and business community, and its new soul, instead conservative, hostile to "the Washington people" and to the world of finance, strong especially in the Central and South states.
The soul, for the point, that became prepotently alive with the vote I said at the beginning.
This just mentioned, however, is just an example of the changes, of the great changes, that the current economic earthquake perhaps preanunciates or already lets us see: not only in the United States but throughout the West and perhaps even here alone.
Both in the USA and in Europe the crisis seems to function as an accelerator of incubation phenomena for a long time that in the new climate solidify and finally come to light.
The first of these is the re-upgrading, the extraordinary revival, of the dual category of State-Sovereignity in relation to a kind of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of financial-banking institutions which, yes, have strong links with abroad, but first of all, are involved in the vast extent of the budgets of people and families living in one country, in one state.
This immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and families who, among other things, are also an electorate.
In other words, the crisis appears economically worldwide, but politically it is almost exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems essentially out of play or not to have much to say: the clear proof is given by the European Union which divides as usual between the different interests and between the different state strategies cannot decide any common policy line.
And so it is from the government of every single state that everyone expects interventions, rescue and recovery plans, new rules, and above all the provision of funds: since when you get to the close it is only the States that own economic resources, the mass of financial resources that can try to put things back in sixth place.
They also have the necessary means and the right to use them: two resources of immeasurable value, in certain circumstances, of which no market and no international organization can possibly have in a similar way.
This new emphasis that the crisis puts on the state-of-the-art element is in perfect harmony with the increasing importance that the most recent developments in the economy tend to attribute to a factor that is very closely linked to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we had now entered the realm of the network, the increasingly sophisticated technology, the immaterial, while we were convinced that globalised finance was now destined to dominate the world, we realized in a way that our future should, instead, be increasingly counting with those very little immaterial things that are the water, the harvest, the oil.
All things that, look a little, can certainly be transported from one place to the other of the earth but are nevertheless absolutely linked to a confined space, to a territory.
So that those who are found to be sovereign, certainly possess several more cards than those who are not, to those who have the misfortune to live in a place without harvests, without oil and without water.
I come to the second news, however, that overlooks a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective need for authoritative leadership, the demand of someone who knows how to take the situation in hand.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leadership, economic species, is so inadequate and full of shade areas.
And together something even deeper and in a certain disturbing sense: a discredit, a lack of indifference, an image of inadequacy, a sense of distance, which tends to involve the entire ruling class in an increasing number of Western countries.
In other words, it seems to be becoming more and more popular, in large sections of the population, to believe that before their actions are the same ideas of the social elites as before, their way of feeling and being, their culture in the overall acceptance of the term, to have made their own time and to be increasingly foreign to the views of the majorities.
The demand for leadership, in short, feeds underground a branched but powerful movement of delegitimization of the ruling classes and traditional political structures, which manifests itself in the sudden "rives" electional or sudden developments of the collective moods of the last and most recent times, from the conservative assess in Austria-Baviera to the collapse of Labour Consensus in Britain, to the rebellion of the American congresses against Bush (and perhaps even the victory of the right in Italy has something to do with it).
It has the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their accredited newspapers, their intellectuals, their formats would say someone, make it increasingly difficult to understand, and thus to represent, what is not from today taking shape in the deep layers of Western societies and that the economic crisis is reinvigorating, increasing, potentially stirring up.
In the face of all this talk of a 'rebellion of the masses' on the agenda would be frankly exaggerated.
But keeping your eyes open for sure is not for nothing.
The Superneck to Walk On The Walls
Defeat the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in the future walk on walls like Spiderman.
It is the goal of several American research centres and now a team of four institutions has gone very close.
With a adhesive of only 2.5 square centimeters, the scholars were able to hold a body of 100 kilograms glued on a vertical wall.
LO STUDIO – The American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of scholars is an evolution of existing ones that use a particular structure of carbon called carbon nanotubes.
"The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged as a pile of spaghetti," explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists have been inspired by the legs of the gechi, covered with microscopic hairs that are able to ensure perfect adherence to the animal.
The tests carried out on different materials, such as glass, Teflon and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles and at the same time "is easily removed from the wall" explains Liming Dai, researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
-"This material could be useful as a transient adhesive" adds Liming Dai.
Perhaps to walk on the walls just like Spiderman? Maybe so, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use such as the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are heat conductors and electric current.
Other applications may concern aerospace engineering.
No superheroes for the moment.
THE OTHER RESEARCH – The University of Berkeley, in California, is also engaged in the search for a new sticker.
In an article on the magazine of the American Chemical Society, Californian scholars presented a adhesive made of microfibre as a hair that self-cleans itself from dust during the movement on a surface to always maintain a perfect grip.
Pharmaceuticals: Never with fruit juices
Attention to grapefruit juice, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed mainly in summer because distant and rich in vitamins, if they take at the same time some life-saving drugs alter their absorption by amplifying or decreasing their effectiveness, depending on the case, with serious health consequences.
To reiterate the risks of fruit juices both packaged and fresh associated with the taking of certain medicines David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, who since the 236th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia launches a new alarm: just a glass of grapefruit juice, orange and apple to reduce the absorption of some life-saving drugs, annulled the beneficial effects and endangering the health of patients.
Pumpelmo juice was already finished under accusation because it was considered responsible for increasing to levels considered toxic the effects of certain anti-arrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, anti-tamine and neurological medicines.
PARMACI A RISCHIO - The Italian Medicine Agency itself had reported this in an information bulletin two years ago warning doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger arising from this mix and to pay attention to what they drink if they take drugs such as Diazepam or Metadone.
NOT ONLY POMPELMO - According to experts also orange juice and apple juice contain substances that inhibit drugs.
Along the list of active substances inhibited by the grapefruit and other juices.
This is where Michele Carruba, director of the Department of Pharmacology at the State University of Milan: "These discoveries are generally immediately reported to the various agencies of the international and national drug that may change the information notes of the drugs.
Then always read the package leaflets of the medicines you are taking and if there is anything that is not clear to us, do not impress us but ask the doctor or pharmacist for clarification" the expert at the agency Ansa pointed out.
The Nobel Prize in Economics in Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize for the Economy was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his studies on trade models and on the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a Newkeynese who teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known publisher of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the major critics of the Bush administration's foreign economic and political choices.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, on the days when Enron failed, Krugman had planned in an editorial published on the New York Times that the second event would have been more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on the history of the United States.
A forecast that sparked not a little controversy and that for years was refaced to the economist, but that it has now turned out to be accurate.
"I am surprised and also somewhat shocked by the speed with which the memory of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom disappeared from public attention," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the executive committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "high-value economist", but also a divulner with a style "very aggressive, particularly critical against the excesses of liberism of the Bush administration".
Open Office, here is the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
It is the day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the suite open source of personal productivity that aims to reach more and more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, as a free alternative to the most well-known Microsoft Office.
After nearly a year's work by volunteer developers, behind which SUN Microsystem monitors, the new Open Office shows itself to the general public with several new features: to the welcome screen and to the revised interface and rendered less sparse, they add other more substantial such as native compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF format (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest ISO standard version.
Attention also to interoperability with the Office 2007, Open Office suite is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some specific features of some modules such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example to send them by e-mail, or the possibility of importing PDF files into the graphics processing module, preserving the original appearance of the page.
Also on this front you can create "PDF hybrids" documents, which accumulate the typical graphics of Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or a text processor.
Collaboration is an element that has received several improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet you can intervene in multiple hands between different users, avoiding conflicts on changes, in the text maker, each employee is assigned a color in the comments for better recognisability during revision.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice functionality to the Web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they should release the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and was added to the English version on the mirrors from Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request it can also be sent at home or at the workplace the installation cd.
And if the topic of gratuity can be a train for the circulation in houses, it is in business that Open Office the suite tries the big bet, already being able to count on several projects carried out in the public administration and in schools.
And there is no lack of the realities that offer an ideal training, advice and assistance service for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could open up business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for Powerpoint emulo presentations; Dbase, as in the case of the most famous Access is the program that allows you to work on the databases; Draw, is finally the graphic module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that today we are almost 3 million and 600 thousand, with the release of the new version it is likely that you can also exceed the expected figure.
Also Kohl is positive is the fourth case of doping
New case of positivity at the last Tour de France: this is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, the Gerolsteiner team, third ranked and winner of the best climber shirt.
To report the news is the website of the newspaper L'Équipe.
The 26 year old Kohl is the fourth positive runner at the Cera, the third generation Epo, after the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, also the Gerolsteiner.
Kohl's blood samples are among those performed in recent weeks by laboratories in Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-analysis confirms the positivity in Cera, the Austrian will lose the third place at the Tour and meet the two years of canonic disqualification.
Confirming the news of Kohl's positivity at the third-generation Epo is the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who informed the Associated Press that he had notified the Austrian authorities of the positivity.
The 26-year-old Austrian took place on the final podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, and also won the best-scaling pellet shirt.
IMMIGRATE YOU: NEW YORK TIMES BELIEVE, IS ITALY RAZIST?
Italy "from the country of migrants has only recently become a privileged destination for immigrants" welcomed reluctantly.
Is this turning the Belpaese into a nation of racists? Is it as you ask in a long article the New York Times that has dedicated a long article to the debate on racism in Italy starting from the case of the young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso killed last month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case highlights what Nyt defines as the "northern paradox": the northern regions are at the same time the ones where it is recorded "more integration and more work" but also the "highest anti-immigrant feeling in the country and the highest support for the Northern League".
Confirming the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, Nyt also mentioned the episodes of intolerance of Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only.
Also the new legislation required by the League that tightens the brakes on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of illegals is cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
Tendence emphasized by both the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano meeting Benedict XVI at Quirinale asked that the state and the Church work together to defeat racism".
Students victims of caro-rents up to 900 euros for a room
The rent market for university students knows no crisis.
According to the last survey of Sunia, the tenants' union, taking a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now taken very serious characters to the point of excluding whole groups of young people from the right to study for the very high overall costs that families of origin should bear - explains the head of the study office of the Sunia, Laura Mariani - in these cities the strong demand by students has so deformed the market to trigger a process of widespread increase also for residents."
In most cases, rental offers then contain a series of violations: free-type contracts, not registered, without limit of canon, connected sub-rents.
For Sonia, extraordinary measures are needed which, through the revision of the tax system, can reduce prices.
Looking at the detail of the survey, we see that in Milan, for a sleeping place in Brianza area, it takes about 450 euros; for a single room you go from a minimum of 650 (Black Band zone) to an average value of 800 (Lambate area, Udine and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 (in Vittoria area).
In Florence a bed space costs an average of 350/400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in the area near the University, they need 250/280 euros for a bed in a double, from 370 to 500 for a single.
In Rome in areas close to the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) about 600 euros are requested for a single room, 450 for a sleeping place in a double.
Values only slightly lower (550 euros for a single room) in areas close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecity).
It only saves if you move to peripheral areas: 300 euros for one bed place and 450 a single one in Prenestine, Centocles and similar areas.
In Naples for a bed space it takes 300/450 euros, for a room it costs from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Polyclinic, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari for one bed it takes 250/350 euros, at least 350 for one single place.
In smaller cities prices are lower in absolute terms, but have a greater weight in the city economy.
In cities where rents to non-Community students, such as in Perugia, are more frequent, there is a further anomaly: the increase of about 25/30% of the canon requested by foreign students compared to that applied to Italians.
So long old cinema Paradiso, cities delete historic halls
Historical cinemas close in favor of the Multiplex.
"A city without cinema halls is a blind city, it's like a face without eyes."
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore photographs effectively what is happening in large Italian urban centers but also in the cities of the province.
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the birth on the outskirts of the large multi-salts and the consequent death by consumption of the monosals in the central areas of the cities, is one of those events that appear to us inevitable and inconvertible but also has all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
To disappear are often historical places and memory loads," it is as if less a friend, a acquaintance with whom we shared a piece of street and many emotions," observes the director of New Cinema Paradiso, the film that twenty years ago brought to Tornatore the Oscar Prize and the Grand Prix of the Cannes Jury, and that told the poetry of a provincial hall and nostalgia for a way of living the lost cinema perhaps forever.
The figures provided by the Anec, the main association of the exhibitors, speak clearly: over the last five years they have closed 316 traditional cinemas, and to pay the major stork are mainly the salts in the main cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the areas most affected by the closures is Emilia-Romagna with 82 monosala cinema lost, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And to show that the first responsible for their disappearance is the advent of multiplex, these are the three Italian regions that have recorded the largest number of new multi-sala cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"The Italian exercise has developed irrationally" observes Paolo Protti, President of the Anec," it is useful to build new structures but it would have to ensure the survival of those already existing, because when a city hall closes, not all its visitors are willing to move into multiplex.
In order not to mention the lack of funding for the savings fund: the prior debt of the state is about 10 million euros.
It is shameful, from an ethical and moral point of view, that the government does not respect the existing laws.
To support the sector would be between 16 and 18 million euros a year".
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, concerned about the closures, has decided to run to the shelters with the signing of a protocol between the Commune and Anec, the first of this type in Italy, to protect and promote monosala cinemas both in the historical centre and in the periphery.
The rules provided include tax facilitation measures for managers and benefits to the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the restricted traffic zone and will have special rates for the stop and in certain parking spaces.
"It is an initiative that I like" observes Giuseppe Tornatore" and I hope other cities follow the example of Bologna by setting up other measures.
However, it is true that in order to counter the overcrowding of the multiplex traditional rooms also need to improve the quality of sound and image, because the public today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the Supercinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to do "New Heavenly Cinema", which I had thought of for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass before the Rialto or the Quirinale of via Nazionale now closed, where I have experienced so many shared emotions, so as not to see the signs drowned by the dust turn me from the other side".
Links between politics and 'nragheta arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to uniform the choices of the Commune to the interests of the Piromalli cosca."
The charges are heavy that the magistrates of the Calabria Anti-Mafia Directorate address the mayor and vice-syndac of Gioia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external competition in Mafia association.
In hand also Gioacchino Piromalli, the old mediator between the clan and the public administrations, and his grandson lawyer, homonym of the boss, already condemned for association to criminalize mafia mold, condemned to pay 10 million euros.
"In spite of any legal and moral rule, as well as common sense," the prosecutors wrote, the two local authorities had expressed the desire to pay advice to lawyer Pyromalli.
"It would have been so granted to the cosca - the judges write - to officially enter the municipalities by facilitating the possibilities, already ingenious, of control and of address of the public administration."
The president of the Calabrian regional junta Agazio Loero does not hide that "collusions between local authorities and organized ill-being are several" in his region: "There are areas where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressure of 'dragheta, heroes who keep clean'.
This morning's arrests follow those last July with which the police announced that they had beheaded the Piromalli cosca.
Since the end of April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro was dissolved but already in 1991, and always for alleged conditions between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been relieved of the task of administering the Commune.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the Udc at the time of the dissolution, was elected at the head of a central right coalition, after the May 2006 ballet.
He shouted at the scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He called in question the former Deputy Minister of Interior Marco Minniti, accusing him of having built everything up on a political issue, but the judges, in the order of arrest signed this morning, explained that the cosca Pyromelli had even come to ask for the variation of the project of the A3.
From the environmental interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, they write the pm, has emerged "the willingness to marry the needs of an entrepreneur, representing a wider group known near the Pyromalli, uniforming the choices of the public administration to the interests of the cosca".
When the energy is born from the waves now the bigs descend into the field
It is an extinct deposit, which occupies more than 70% of the planet's surface and is now discovering it by the great global energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources on which they put their eyes, and now they try to put their hands, big as the Chevron.
The possibility of obtaining energy from sea movements has been studied for a hundred years now and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, the research intensified.
When the price of oil fell, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was put aside, but now the environmentalists and the new oil increase give impetus to the sector.
London's World Energy Council (WEC) estimated in 2007 that 15% of the world's electricity requirement could be covered by sea-going motorcycle exploitation facilities.
This would be twice as much as the amount currently produced by nuclear power plants.
And there would be currents and tides.
Colossi to the attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build a plant in Northern Portugal.
When the understanding was announced it seemed a revolutionary step.
Two years away from betting on marine energy are increasing and among these companies have always voted for traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying technologies on ocean energy - he has declared the spokesperson of a company associated with the giant oil tanker in the economic newspaper Wall Street Journal - and is evaluating the possibility of cooperating with us."
The cooperation in question concerns obtaining a permit from the United States Committee on Energy, which is necessary to launch a project for the exploitation of marine energy in Alaska.
It is a signal not long ago, especially if it is considered that in Alaska the US continues to extract oil and President Bush has recently launched a plan for new trivellations.
In addition to Chevron there are the Verdant Power Inc. in New York and the Ocean Power in New Jersey to walk along the path of energy coming from the sea and the sums invested so far, however unknown in the details, indicate to observers an upward interest.
Technology to be developed.
Experts are talking about technology at the beginning, also because marine energy does not escape all the doubts about the environmental impact.
For now, plants such as the Portuguese one or some in Scotland are small and do not seem to create big problems to the ecosystem.
To produce energy on a large scale, however, technologies must be used with a greater environmental impact.
And the choices are different: the Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of boe connected to each other.
The thrust of the waves, which moves the boe up and down is converted into hydraulic pressure by pistons and cylinders inside the floaters.
Pressure drives a turbine that in turn feeds a generator.
Electricity is sent to shore through submarine cables.
For now, there are four installations of this type under design, waiting only for federal approval and part of the energy could serve for military installation.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces energy for a shopping mall and parking using six submarine turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movement when there are tides spins the blades of turbines, creating a rotational movement that feeds a generator.
Verdant said he has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorisations to take advantage of energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say to the Institute for the Research of Electricity, is currently worth the potential of the tides.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is precisely on the energy of the tides that were like that of New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others overlooking the coast, they have already invested $7 million and a half in 2008 and planned investments up to 35 million for 2009.
