A Republican Strategy to Combat the Reelection of Obama
The Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Centre considers the latter to be a myth, claiming that electoral fraud is rarer in the United States than the number of people killed by lightning.
In addition, Republican lawyers have only identified 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the United States is responsible for the organization of the federal elections in the United States.
It is in this spirit that a majority of U.S. governments promulgated from 2009 new laws making the registration or voting process more difficult.
This phenomenon has grown after the November 2010 elections, which have added 675 new Republican representatives to 26 States.
As a result, 180 draft laws restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 States were introduced in the year 2011.
The new electoral laws require voters to present an identity card with photo and proof of American citizenship.
Furthermore, these laws also reduce the periods of advance voting, invalidate the right to register as an elector on the day of election and withdraw the right to vote from the courts.
Before the 2006 elections, no U.S. state required voters to present an identity card with a photo.
Indiana was the first state to impose such a requirement.
The United States Supreme Court confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of the Indian Law.
The Republican authorities endeavoured to extend this practice to other States.
Over the past two years, they sponsored legislation in 34 States to force voters to present a photo ID card.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have universal identity cards such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, 21 million people of voting age, do not have photo identity cards issued by a government agency of their state.
In addition, five million new electors in 2012 do not have such an identity.
However, it often costs over a hundred dollars to obtain the required ID card.
New restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities, and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people earning less than 35,000 dollars; 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 do not have the required identity card with photos.
Much more.
Students, voters considered to be more voting for democratic candidates, are not allowed in several States to use their photo ID card issued by their institution.
However, those same States allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who vote more on the Republican side to use to vote on the cards issued by those clubs.
Before 2004, no State required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to present such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove that they are American citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Spanish vote.
It appears, however, that two out of three Hispanic electors favor the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican legislators sponsored legislation in 2011 abolishing the registration of voters on polling day in eight States.
In addition, they limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters wishing to register.
These restrictions are not without consequence.
For example, during the 2004 general election, voters' registration campaigns contributed to the registration of approximately 10 million citizens.
However, the measures adopted since 2009 have dropped the registration rate of new electors by 17% in 2010 compared with 2006.
In addition, the Republican legislators adopted laws in five other States aimed at reducing the period of advance voting.
For example, during the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of the voters who voted in advance were African-Americans, while the voters represented only 13% of the state's voters.
The same was true of the Hispanics.
They represented only 11% of the voters, but 24% of the citizens who voted in advance.
On the other hand, the whites who formed 76% of the voters represented only 46% of the voters voting in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters vigorously opposed the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
Several bills were blocked by the vetoes of democratic governors.
The Attorney General of the United States intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to limit some of the damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 States have adopted laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID card.
However, the new rules put in place will undoubtedly make the exercise of the right to vote more difficult in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been voted and see it as a clear objective of influencing the results in 2012 in key states.
A 2011 report by the Brennan Centre shows that States that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes required by the Electoral College to win the presidency.
It is too early to assert with certainty that these legislative changes in the electoral system will have significant impacts on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively influence the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate cancer screening: pass the test or not?
In fact, the PSA test would sometimes present incorrect results, with false negative results or false positive results, which result in unnecessary medical interventions.
What will make men who are already reluctant to pass screening tests even more hesitant.
Pass the test or not?
We asked for the opinion of two specialists.
In the studies conducted in the United States, there was a lot of contamination among the control groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and to have firm recommendations.
Another study, the European study, concluded a difference in mortality between patients who had a screening and those who had not.
This study also demonstrated, with a follow-up after 12 years, that between 30 and 40% more chances of having metastasis if not reported.
So I recommend the test from 50 years old, or from 40 years old if we have a direct parent who has already had prostate cancer.
African-American men are also at greater risk.
The key is to make the right decision once cancer has been detected.
There are aggressive and other cancers that are indolent.
It is really necessary to make the patient understand the degree of risk of his or her cancer, by offering him or her possible options, not necessarily treating prostate cancers that do not affect long-term life, and instead opting, in those cases, for active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men in whom cancer is detected will not be treated, because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
They will be suggested to do active monitoring and if the disease progresses, they will be given treatment.
Increasingly, the criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated are clearly identified.
So I still recommend that you pass the test.
But the important thing is to have a discussion with your doctor to determine whether or not you should pass it.
In collaboration with the International Urology Society, Movember has created a tool to evaluate the para and anti-APS test.

Preventing disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of research, the adoption of good living habits remains the best way to reduce the risk of it.
It is estimated that if everyone ate well and moved sufficiently, 30% of the cancers could be prevented.
"If no one else smoked, this rate would rise to at least 50%," said André Beaulieu, spokesperson for the Canadian Cancer Society.
On the other hand, it is estimated that about 10% of the cancers are caused by heredity.
Several remain also totally unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority, despite a decrease in the number of smokers.
Cigarette is related to 85% of cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several others.
This is a huge impact on people's health.
"Even today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," laments spokesperson André Beaulieu.
Encouraged: 10 years after smoking is dropped, the risk of dying of cancer falls by half.
Weight
Infection and obesity also promote the onset of the disease, according to CSC.
They would increase the risk of breast, colon and rectum, oesophagus, pancreas and uterus cancer.
"Research shows that the regular practice of physical activity throughout a lifetime protects against colon cancer," he adds.
The power supply
The organization also recommends limiting its consumption of red meat.
In too much, it raises the risk of being infected with colorectal cancer.
Charcuteries too, and they should be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting may result in the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"The latter can damage the body's cells and lead to cancer development," they say.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the linkages between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their research is not conclusive at the moment.
Vitamin E studies are contradictory, according to CSC.
While one found a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, another noted rather an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clearly established either.
In addition, Mr Beaulieu stressed the importance of talking about his concerns and family history with his doctor.
"Passing a screening test, it doesn't give cancer."
Higgs Boson Decorticated
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson has created an emo, last summer, and for reasons.
We believe that this boson participates in the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the Universe, nothing but that.
And then, it's the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model - our best, or "less worse" explanation of the nature and behaviour of the matter - but which has not yet been observed empirically.
But for physicists, it is not yet entirely certain that it is much of the Higgs.
We know without shadow that we are holding an authentic new particle, and that it looks much like the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, new data released this week at a large congress of physics in Kyoto seem to confirm it, but still lacks data to be perfectly certain.
Let's assume it's about the Higgs, as the chances of cheating seem thin, and let's see what it's about.
There is, in this low world, a fatally inevitable law that wants two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
No way to break this rule - and don't try too hard, you're going to hurt yourself.
But even though particle physics is a strange world, it turns out that it also has a law of this kind: Pauli's principle of exclusion, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "canthic state" - this "state" consisting vastly in some of their characteristics.
From there, physicists classify particles into two categories.
In one corner, there are good citizens named farmers, who wisely obey Pauli's principle.
And in the other one are the bosons, a dirty band of anarchists who have no respect for anything - in any case, not for this principle, which means that they can indeed and well be in the same place, at the same time.
These bosons are then divided into two groups, according to the site (absolutely extraordinary, in fact) The Article Adventure, Berkeley Laboratories: the mesons, which we will not approach here, and the "particles of force", by which the great forces of nature propagate and to which the Higgs boson would in some way be related.
These bosins, we must emphasize here, are not all beasts as exotic as we might think.
In fact, if you can read this chronicle, it is thanks to a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon, or the "particle of light" that is the "messager" of electromagnetic force.
When, in fact, a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it "distorts" the electromagnetic field in this specific place, a bit like a pebble thrown in a pond.
From this "disagreement" is born an electromagnetic wave (light, or infrared, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon - and therefore, one of the "power-bearers" bosons.
More stable field
The same goes with the Higgs boson, to this difference that it is another field, the Higgs field, which must be "distorted" so that this boson appears.
However, this field of Higgs is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, it is necessary to achieve very, very high energies, a little as if it were a frozen pond whose only a very large rock could wrinkle the surface.
This is why we need a huge particle accelerator like the CERN - the Large Hadron Collider is a 27 km ring of circumference! - to achieve such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
It is not all the particles, nor all the materials, that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like the lovers, do, but others don't - a piece of paper, for example, will never be on a fridge of itself.
And in the same way, it is not all the particles that interact with the Higgs field: those that do it have a mass, while the others (like the photon, you) do not have it.
Now, what can "bring" all these researches, asks Mrs. Plamondon?
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the Standard Model (MS), and also allows physicists to scrutinize any gap between the observations and predictions of the MS.
In fact, there are many who want to be found, because the slightest difference could open a door on a "new physical" and make some holes of the Model.
This one has to say, still has enormous deficiencies, offering no explanation for gravity (ops!) or dark matter, which forms about 80% of the material of the Universe (re-ops!).
But no such deviations have been found at CERN so far.
Impacts
The impact of these researches on the daily lives of Mr. and Mrs. Tout-le-Monde, they are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will be no such research.
Consider: At the very beginning of the 1960s, laser pioneers in Bell Laboratories did not suspect the revolution that their work would trigger.
They were using scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, we have already been told by physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed), in 1962 -, initially the laser was seen as a "legget".
Imagine...
And then, applications can also come from all the instruments around the search.
For example, this same Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969, in the course of his optical work.
This sensor, although it was not entirely his original intention, now serves as a "eye" to all the digital cameras in the world, and has earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics 2009.
This does not mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC will necessarily transform our lives, but it means that we really never know...
Palliative care - The best way to die...
With its Commission dying in dignity, Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate must resume shortly as a bill is being prepared.
In this vital area, however, much remains to be done.
The duty has tried to look closer.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. still lived alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that was sprinkling him had left him a two-year history.
"They had given me five years to live, I've been seven years," he said, half-daughter, lying in his bed at the palliative care house Victor-Gadbois, of Beloeil, where he arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, you can't be prepared for it," he says.
The disease does its job: an enormous weakness that prevents him from going to the toilet alone, and even eating alone.
Stabbed in front of an appetizer, he agreed to let himself be helped to eat, signed.
Bravely, he even smiles, speaks to the strangers who come around him, bring him his medication, offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is that I'm cured of diarrhea, it's humiliating," he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this disease.
"In the course of our life, we learn that a man, it pisses up," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois house.
Returning to the child's stage, for some people, is unacceptable humiliation.
"It depends on the person's ability" to accept the regression, he notes.
Because, in the opinion of several people working in palliative care, great moments take place at the very heart of this regression.
Patients entering the Victor-Gadbois palliative care house all suffer from cancer.
They have a life expectancy of up to three months.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer provides so-called " curative" care.
For Ms. A., 89, the worst fear is to die " conscious and suffocated " .
But the disease made me discover my children.
"I have good kids," she adds.
"I no longer have wishes in life," she says, before accepting a mask to help her breathe.
She is still waiting for a last visit of her son from Italy in the coming days.
At Victor-Gadbois, a group of volunteers, the body's care and food aid are being provided.
These are palliative care, which is given when there is nothing else to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is a palliative care bed for 11,700 people.
It's very few when we know we all end up dying one day.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the house.
Whether it is physical, emotional, or spiritual comfort.
At death, we will agree to provide oral care to the brandy or Pepsi, as required.
Diabetes will no longer be required to control their sugar levels.
And death is part of the day.
Last night, a beer was served to Mr. X, who died during the night.
This morning, it is his son who will finish the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help our loved ones as much as our patients," says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
At the Victor-Gadbois house, the days are followed but are not similar.
Next to a 93-year-old man who savours his last family meeting in the court, very quiet in his pillows while he is being sledged in his honor, a 36-year-old man tragically dies, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two young children, after having tried everything to survive.
"For six months, there have always been three to five beds occupied by cancer patients under 45," Dr. Christiane Martel worried.
53% of patients admitted to the Victor-Gadbois house come from their homes, 47% from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, care designed to alleviate suffering when a sick person has reached the terminal phase of his life, whether at home, in the hospital or in the nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois House and the Société de palliatives at home in Greater Montreal, specialize more or less exclusively in the care offered to cancer patients.
It is precisely this great deficiency in Quebec's health care that causes a number of doctors specialized in palliative care to fear the adoption of a law governing euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto, signed by Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe of Palliative Care summits, has been circulating to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not performing enough to ensure that everyone will have the right to quality palliative care before euthanasia is accepted.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient spend 14 days in emergency, in great pain, without doing the necessary to relieve her.
I'm afraid patients are asking to die just because they don't get proper care.
And at the same time, several oncologists hang on their patients until the last day, despite the worst predictions.
Helene Richard's survival hopes were already minimal when she abandoned a challenging chemotherapy.
When I told my uncle that I was stopping treatment, she said that she regretted that I stopped fighting, she told me.
Yet she told me that I was finished!
Not all-powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who claim to die thank the caregivers for not having access to their requests after they have been relieved of their pain by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Grand Montréal Home Palliative Care Society, patients would be refractory to pain treatment in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, physicians often resort to palliative sedation, which re-sleeps until the moment of death, either sporadicly or permanently.
We can no longer pretend not to hear this part of suffering.
Increasingly, the unresolved patient will have the possibility of having this palliative sedation.
The sick who are not relieved always say the same phrase: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want you to euthanize me", that means "I want to be relieved".
This report was made possible by a journalistic scholarship from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials of the road, BTP entrepreneurs, fund collectors of political parties and specialists of the Italian Mafia relate day after day what they know of a formidable "system", mixing building industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mafia.
A " industry " costing Quebec taxpayers very much, especially in the 1990s and 2000.
"It's funny how the system has been freaking out since we took the great means," ironic Jacques Duchesneau, Member of Parliament in Quebec and former Chief of Police in Montreal.
It was by him that the scandal broke out in 2011 through a substantive investigation into maltreatments related to the contracts of road work in Quebec, to which the liberal prime minister of the time, Jean Charest, had only consented in retreats.
The "Duchesneau Report" established a direct link between industry, occult funding of parties and corruption of civil servants.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he points out, the only Ministry of Transport would have spared a billion dollars on contracts," some referring their instincts to reach a share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already dropped two mayors", he adds, hoping that it will succeed in "demonstrate the strata behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, also meets with its army of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
Plus the officers of "Marteau Squad" who, since 2009, would have led Montreal's "trailer" to put the soft pedal on the swelling of contracts...
In recent weeks, she has conducted serial searches and charges of fraud and corruption against municipal elected officials, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburban town.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who just resigned from his post as mayor of Laval, the third city of Quebec.
It is suspected that it has used wine pots to repeat in exchange for public contracts.
They are also formally charged with engineers at the Montreal Road and Italian entrepreneurs, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter made sense by explaining to the commission the mechanics of the "system" of obtaining public contracts.
For years he himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to a mafia-related intermediary who paid money back to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gerald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambia had been winding up in the 2000s, giving over $88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially Liberals then in power.
He also confessed to organizing an illegal fundraising for the former Liberal Prime Minister, Nathalie Normandeau.
Drain contracts, cost-absorbing
In Montreal, the corruption "system" worked roundly.
Gilles Surprising, an ex-engineer in public works, has made it very detailed before the commission: in ten years, he received gift construction companies, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and wine pots, totaling $736,000, in exchange for sewers contracts whose costs he added.
Other road officials have confessed to fattening their feet by inflating from 30% to 40% invoices by false extras.
Then an organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately closing his eyes on a parallel budget feeding his boxes with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned early November, diving into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montreal's first to draw the alarm bell.
The mayor of the district of Rivière-des-Prairies, east of the island, rises from 2010 against the sale of a municipal land purchased $5 million and resale... 1.6 million to developers, in full real estate boom.
70% of dirty money in electoral campaigns
From the investigation that will finally be put in place, she says that she "draws on a wire that allows to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop gangrene and pin wrongdoing".
The process, she says, is "painful but positive".
The wound is being cleaned up, but it would take an investigation unit in Montreal and one day, not to see the questionable practices coming back.
Like we're cleaning up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes that "public servants have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is concerned especially about the role of "elected in the knowledge of the stratagème", when they did not climb in the jaw!
Estimated to 70% of the share of money in the funding of electoral campaigns in Quebec, he ironies: "I was told that it was only a pale reflection of reality."
The Government of Quebec proposes to limit the donations to parties to $100, but this will not change the gift, he says: "As long as electoral expenses are not strictly limited, there will be dirty money in politics."
He proposes a complete revision of the system of public contracts and party financing: "We cannot go any further; go to the bottom, with courage, to rebuild the house on stronger bases, with more controls and laws."
If this story ternizes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh at it to look in their own courtyard...
"The PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
This season, you took a new size with the PSG.
How do you explain this progression?
It can be explained by an individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of the GSP.
Big players have arrived.
Every day, I make progress with them.
The technical staff also brought me a lot.
Every day, these elements move me to raise my level of play.
And in the game, it's easier.
It's all going very fast in the football.
But I'm not burning up.
From my beginnings at the INF Clairefontaine pre-formation center to my passage to Saint-Etienne, I have always advanced by standards.
You therefore take advantage of the competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti...
This summer's recruits are used to playing high-level games.
They also know that each training is crucial.
Which makes a player like me want to face up to and provide the maximum.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti brings me a lot about my position.
He is supported by deputies like Claude Makeelele, who played the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man of the situation?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect among all technicians.
Today he is not equal in League 1 and is one of the best European coaches.
He has a great experience and has won a lot of titles with hupped clubs.
He's been side by side with great players.
I think he'll win other titles in Paris.
In January, I had a comforting discussion with him.
I was out of a series of injuries then.
The trust he gives me also explains my performance.
What are you looking at the first part of the season of the GSP?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took us as our leader.
But we're stuck in ambush.
One of our main objectives is the League of Champions: we have qualified for the 8th finals with the way.
What is the club's objective in this competition?
We'll try to go as far as possible.
Everything can happen now.
But we will have our word to say in front of very good European teams.
We first want to finish first of our chicken, in front of Porto, so we can receive at the 8th final return.
Can the PSG become a large European short-term club?
He already has the budget...
In order to become a large European club, Paris needs to win titles and register in time.
Today, that is not the case.
Financially, the GSP provides the means for this project to be implemented.
In Ligue 1, would it not be a big failure to win the title, like last season?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
This year, we really want to wear this title.
Last season, we didn't go far.
In May, there was disappointment because we had the qualities to finish first.
We had a very big season.
We're done with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, we're supposed to be champions...
But another team, Montpellier, has achieved an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's the right one.
Although big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have the weapons to take it.
Do you think the media expect too much of the GSP?
Of course we expect a lot from us in view of what has been invested and the players we have.
We totally accept it.
Then, when you win 4-0 at home against Troyes and you still find things to blame for us, it's certainly a little frustrating.
We wonder what people expect more.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We're not the FC Barcelona!
We're trying to put in place a game project.
A team builds up over time.
We have proven in the League of Champions that we can answer.
Look at Manchester City, which has not been able to qualify for the 8th finals for two seasons, they have also made huge expenses!
In the face of the money invested, you were imagined with 15 points ahead of the truce!
It was neglecting our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not well last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we will be able to have the smile by telling us that, despite all the difficulties, we have finally taken it away.
The GSP seems totally dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic's exploits.
The better we say there's a Zlatan addiction.
This means that Ibrahimovic is very efficient and that he sets a lot of goals.
He came for this and he proves he's League 1 star.
He showed everywhere he went that he was a great player, a world star.
Within the group, we respect the man and the player.
He also respects the men he has around him.
What he did is truly exceptional.
This moves others to raise their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the world's best defenders, also allows everyone to make progress.
How did you live the Euro 2012 with the French team?
Like a disappointment.
I wanted to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from piling up playing time.
I've seen things there, and I've been strengthened.
Today, I'm able to make good selection games.
That's what I've been waiting for since my baptism with the Blues.
We have learned from what has happened in Ukraine and we must have exemplary behaviour today.
What do you look at the first months of Didier Deschamps at the head of the Blues?
He's got the results for him.
We're well placed in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The selector is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires the win.
As was Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make comparisons.
Blanc had achieved its goal by qualifying us for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will drive the Blues to Brazil.
Is the good null (1-1) taken away on 16 October in Spain a founding match?
This match has given us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before this shock in Spain, I've never had the same game in my career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
All the opposite of current monetary trade, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing costs between stakeholders.
In addition, as often as in these technologies, a political vision is clear: the conviction that the current monetary system, made of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros...) and a secure exchange protocol in the way of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of peer-to-peer files.
About 200,000 transactions have already been registered with 15,000 computers on the network.
A small thousand websites accept bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment.
The bitcoin course, after reaching a top of $30 (EUR 23) in June 2011, fell to $2, five months later, before returning today around ten dollars (the courses are recorded on the bitcoincharts.com site).
Nothing very impressive, compared to world trade in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) took an interest in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes bitcoin as "virtual currency most successful", "in competition with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin distinguishes itself from other types of virtual currency such as "credits", used to advance in a video game that you win by playing or that you can buy (and sometimes exchange in return).
The Facebook social network has also developed this kind of system.
But every time a central authority controls and deals with trade.
With Bitcoin, all nodes in the network are both account book depositors, auditors, money issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail.
Except that a user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is signed electronically by a double-key encryption system.
The network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the bitcoins exchanged exist well in the public account book, broadcast throughout the network.
The key step is to write this new transaction in this book.
It passes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge to computers, and the winner, a kind of provisional central banker, will have the privilege of adding this additional line.
This is a file hassle phase, that is, turning a large file into a shorter and unique digital print.
Computers "take" the new transaction and add a number before "to" the whole.
The aim is to find the number that gives a particular print (many zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other knots easily check that it's the right one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of all other transactions; any change would change the print.
If, to cheat, one user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (less than ten minutes), only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other remaining orphan because the two have different prints.
The computer that solved the challenge won 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this reward is divided by two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible up to a hundred millionth, leaving the margin...
The challenge is also raised at each increase in the power of calculation.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
Web sites providing services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins in stolen deposits.
"The fault used does not concern the protocol itself", says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a payment company in real currency using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also notes the possibilities of money-laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this defect.
Weight actors like Wikipedia refuse such gifts.
Others, such as the WordPress blog platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, from the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the book of accounts and showed that almost 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, "gender balances" were launched.
"Three thousand dollars have been exchanged," rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, also the author of a textbook on this currency, believes much to the potential of this technology as a network of transactions.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a mobile payment without contact, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which thus return less expensive.
The carrier manages his identity more and can therefore be anonymous.
The system is easy to operate with merchants, who do not need to install new terminals or software.
Just give them an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize", says Pierre Noizat, who ensures thousands of users.
There is a general movement to challenge hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
"It will take time for Bitcoin to impose, but 2013 could be a turn," he predicted.
The ECB, in its report, also plans to reassess the various risks, which are now considered high, in the event of the success of this currency.
We left Afghanistan.
And then what?
The French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and Americans are expected to continue at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without waiting for us.
It is mainly the Afghan peasants that we have punished by considering them as terrorists.
And we ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, and the wounded, the maimed.
The Taliban are composed of foreign extremists, former refugee leaders in Pakistan, but often peasants who refuse foreign military presence, like the Soviets.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if they have been joined by jihadists, Pakistani, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes assisted by local insurgents, these will no longer be so when the Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I observed from the top of the hills planted with almond trees thanks to French credits, was done in order.
Truck and armoured convoys joined Kabul without being attacked, overflew by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban detachment on Kabul from the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since their unsustainable progress from 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was then empty, the country on fire and blood because of the struggles between different factions.
Their control of the country had then been perceived as a sort of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans paid the price of the obscurantism of these peasants exceeded by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved today.
Former Mudjahidin, Afghan government and current Taliban join in the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main notables of the anti-Soviet war came to power in 2001.
They moved into affairists, seizing government lands to resell them on land to build refugees from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from huge U.S. contracts of subcontracting.
They have become distracted; most of them have not fought themselves.
People, as I heard in the campaigns, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have been able to take advantage of the American breadth: the flight of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They sided with the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan, and appreciated their benefits.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years old; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one fifth of the total population.
In cities, government schools are full, girls and boys.
It will be necessary to provide work for these young people who will no longer want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
All, including armed opponents, are full of mobile phones; television, and its Turkish leaves that have a modern world, are followed everywhere.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who order it be considered legitimate?
Former anti-Soviet commanders are already concerned with rebuilding provincial militias, which will escape central power.
Afghanistan, a mountain country, to the strong local identities, should be able to benefit from some decentralization, in the image of Western nations, but the United States wanted to transform it into a centralised state, to a strong presidential power, removing the post of Prime Minister that existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, particularly on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But its country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and long before.
No industry has been launched, no dams are in place, no major irrigation system is repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruits and vegetables.
The priority is left to the private initiative.
In a country destroyed by thirty years of war, government control of infrastructure would have been necessary.
The sound was widespread in Afghanistan with immense mining wealth.
This has only added to the feeling that the Westerners were only there to take over.
Without energy to treat the iron or copper or on site, nor means of transport to export it through the mountains, there is no mining operation.
The Chinese have already almost left the copper mine in My Aynak, leaving international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) to search for the immense Buddhist site and remain the largest employers in the province.
One day it will also take Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are heavily dependent on imports and exports, to restore normal relations.
The departure of the French fighting troops ended on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: lycée of girls, boys, French department at the university, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, to try to "gain the hearts and minds" and to accomplish the task of co- coinciding aid and offensive actions, a service of "civil-military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Chimic), abolished in 2012, carried out, and carried out by a small French NGO, numerous collective work and agricultural rehabilitation actions in dozens of mountain villages.
This work, in local labour, was able to help contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increase in cultivatable surfaces.
What are we going to remember, after two billion euros of military spending?
A much more modest budget would contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, very harsh in these valleys, often more than 2,000 metres high.
The Embassy has received dozens of written requests from local communities in Kapisa province.
In order to free themselves from the insurgency of foreign groups, what farmers have said they wish, they should maintain in their favour a small, well-controlled and directly affected civil aid.
A Constitution with Forceps in Egypt
This is a new poker shot by President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration, which temporarily grants it full powers, it has decided to play its va-t.
Taking everyone in court, he announced on Wednesday that the constituent Assembly would vote on his final text the following day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State had given this Assembly two additional months to complete its work.
It is soon two years that Egypt is based on an interim text, several times amending what weakens institutional stability and leads to legal fraud.
This new initiative has only increased the fracture in the country.
For his opponents, the President perseveres in his "autocratic delusion", continuing to "trace his word" and "peetinar the law".
On the side of its supporters, it is ensured that it is a means of ending the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible, accelerating the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 15 days.
A very short period of time that forces the Brothers to give up their project to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way of regaining popular and democratic legitimacy while the protest rages throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in favour, as he said in an interview with the US weekly Time.
Since the use of such a precipitated vote is based on ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "If you vote for my text, either I retain the full powers", they are supposed to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of this constituent Assembly, with a vast majority of Islamists, voted on the text yesterday.
Most of the Liberals were missing the call.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had knocked on the door, believing that they could not have made their views.
The representatives of human rights, religious minorities or civil society had done the same.
In order for the necessary quorum to be reached, 11 people, replacement members, were added to the hurry last morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brothers.
Without surprise, it is most often unanimously voted on.
On the other hand, commentators were amused by the fact that one of the only differences of the day had been expressed around... the hour of prayer, some members of the committee felt that the pendulum of the constituent was poorly fixed.
The text, which was still being voted on last night, contains 234 articles.
Finally, article 2 of the Constitution of 1971 remains the same, stating that "the principles of sharia are the main source of law."
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a major claim, hoped to be able to replace "the principles" with "the rules", which would have allowed stricter application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been modified is a guarantee of their goodwill and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy," respond the Liberals, who see only a stroke of communication.
For according to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
These include section 220, which gives the Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular with regard to verifying compliance with the law with the Sharia.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, it is worrying because "people called to pronounce are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
We can see the beginnings of a theocracy."
The fears of the Liberals are further aroused by the fact that the next rector of this university should be much less moderate than the current one.
"For the time being, there is no concrete religious involvement.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil state.
Most jurists who have worked on this text are not olemas but academics, for some trained in the French system" temperate Alexis Blouet, who prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges "that there may be an ambiguity around section 220, because the terms used are used in the religious vocabulary.
It refers to the "fiqh" in particular [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].
And the question could in the future arise as to the extent to which civil judges are competent to rule on it."
Beyond its religious aspect, the text voted yesterday is highly criticised because of the extensive powers it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argued that these were significantly reduced compared to what they were under the former regime.
Another controversial point: the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the review of the Defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a National Defence Council.
No more than civilian trials in military courts, as requested by human rights associations, will be prohibited.
They also express concern about the text, which they consider to be libertic.
The crime of blasphemy is maintained and the insult is now prohibited, which could have serious consequences on freedom of expression, including the press.
In addition, no article shares the protection of women, notes Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by article 36.
The word did not appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president was expected to speak on television last night, demonstrations were scheduled this afternoon.
The support of the Head of State will parade them on Saturday.
In Israel, holy places, the World Centre and a sea of brine await Ukrainian tourists
The Promised Land brings together the grandeur of Bible truths, modern comfort and a wild nature.
Argoumenty i Fakty has had five great reasons to go to Israel.
Go Worship the Holy Places
Make yourself clear: the shores of the Jordan, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that whoever enters these "baptismal funds" will be affected by the Divine Grace.
As for Galilee, it is the land of the miracles of Jesus: where the water was changed into wine, where Jesus walked on the water, where he quieted the storm, or where the fishing was miraculous.
It is at this precise place that Jesus appeared before his disciples after the Resurrection.
But where you will find the most holy places, it is well in Jerusalem.
Believers walk through the Rue de la Souffrance or the Cross road (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
This path begins near the fortress Antonia (the pretoria), where the trial took place, then led through the streets of the old city to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on the Golgotha, towards the place of the Crucifixion, and to that of the Peter of the Onction and the burial place.
This is where the Christian centre of the world stands, a symbol of humanity's salvation.
According to Christian legend, the monastery of the Cross is erected at the place where it grew the tree used to make the cross on which Jesus was crucified.
Jerusalem also houses the most sacred place of the Jews: the Wall of Lamentations, which constitutes the rest of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 B.C.E.
According to tradition, people of different faiths leave small words accompanied by prayers that are then answered.
Travel in height
Visit the ruins of the Massada fortress, a former refuge against enemies built by Herod the Great in 25 B.C. for his family.
These ruins lie on the steep rocks of a mountain 450 m above sea level.
Only mountaineering lovers can go there by their own means.
For others, a cable car takes them to this top full of history.
In the north of the country, between 1,600 and 2,040 m of altitude, there is the ski resort of Mont Hermont which hosts many tourists during the winter.
A shuttle can drive you from the foot of the mountain.
Ski slopes total 45 km long.
The old beliefs want pagan gods to have inhabited the mountain summit once.
Visit unique museums
This country houses about 300 museums.
It is impossible to visit all of them during one stay.
Here are the five most interesting ones that are really worth the detour.
First of all: the Israel Museum near the Knesset (Parliament).
It houses the very ancient manuscripts of Qumran, or Dead Sea manuscripts, discovered in the caves of the Desert of Judaea, as well as nearly 500 miles of archaeological and anthropological objects.
See also: the Museum of Art of Tel-Aviv.
It mainly includes the canvases of impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Acre, the Hammam Al-Basha awaits you with its Turkish baths composed of wettings of visitors and overseers of the time.
Once in Césarée, enter the only Private Ralli Museum where you can admire Rodin's sculptures.
There are no guides or souvenir shops.
Entrance is free and donations are forbidden.
The fifth museum is the Museum of the Holocaust or Memorial of Yad Vashem, located in Tel-Aviv, which returns to the most dramatic historical pages of history.
The most tragic part is the children's memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children exterminated in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter it and enter into total darkness.
Stars sparkle.
You then hear the names of Jewish children and the names of countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health and well-being
The three large seaside resorts of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each of them offers swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and giant aquariums.
Note: you can bathe in the Red Sea even in winter, because the water temperature does not fall below 21° while the air temperature can reach 23°.
The Dead Sea is even hotter and you can bathe there all year round.
By the way, it is the world's most unique sea: it occupies the lowest point on Earth, or 417 m below sea level.
The blue water contains brine and very easily holds the bathers, even those who cannot swim.
The landscapes surrounding it are of surrealistic beauty.
There we come to perform a treatment based on salt water, lemon, curative sludge and to treat various diseases such as dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, but also to simply relax.
Discover the secrets of antiquity
They are kept by the old city of Tel-Aviv, Jaffa, on the shore of the Mediterranean Sea.
It is crossed by the famous Via Maris that connects Egypt, Syria, Anatoly and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in the Greek and Egyptian legends of antiquity.
According to legend, this is where Noah built his ark and that Perseus saved the beautiful Andromede, with whom he lived here himself a long and happy life.
Tourists particularly like to walk in narrow streets that bear the name of the zodiac signs.
It is said that if you touch the walls of the street corresponding to "your" sign, destiny will smile upon you.
In Jaffa you will be able to meet young married people who came to take photo sessions from all Israel and even from other countries.
At Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you will be able to walk into the Roman theatre, "conquering" the fortress of the Crusaders.
Under the Roman Empire, Caesar was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Ponce Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera shows.
Note to tourists
If you leave for Israel, do not worry about your English: about 30% of the population speak Russian.
For your trip, it is better to prefer the dollars to the euro because they are easily interchangeable in shekels (today 1 dollar is equivalent to 3.8 shekels).
As far as urban transport is concerned, they are mainly buses, but Jerusalem is equipped with a quick tramway and Haifa has the only metro line in the country, consisting of six stations and capable of connecting the low and high parts of the city.
It's almost an underground funicular.
The journey in all types of public transport costs 6 shekels and allows you to make changes for 1h30.
In Israel, Jewish tradition is to celebrate the Sabbath on Saturday.
From Friday night to sunset on Saturday, the markets, shops and public transport cease their activity.
And the work week starts on Sunday morning.
Many cafes, restaurants and hotels serve only cashew food, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes made up of both milk and meat.
It offers a multitude of dishes based on lamb and beef, soups and desserts based on coconut milk, but also the humous, the traditional Jewish pasta, various sauces, the balls of soft chickpeas, falafels, fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
On the other hand, we find a lot of well-fed cats that walk up the air.
We can see them sleep on the roofs of cars parked.
These felinees love the passing places and do not refuse to be given to them.
The rental of a car varies according to the mark of $37 for 24h (Hyundai Getz) at $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance costs $15 a day.
Renting a bike will cost you 15 shekels a day.
An entrance to the museum costs an average of 30 shekels.
The language of the numbers
Three million tourists from around the world visited Israel in 2012.
These were mostly people who came to travel and rest from the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
118.8 miles of Ukrainian tourists visited the Promised Land from January to October 2012, 51% more than in 2010, before the cancellation of visas on February 9, 2011.
"Which language has, in Moscow goes": migrants save money to learn the language
While MEPs and human rights activists are arguing about what the law on compulsory language testing will give, fraudsters selling "false" certificates have already made their appearance in the country
Each year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, Saint Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of the time, they are nationals of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only purpose: to earn money to help their families stay at home.
Since 1 December, a law has entered into force and states that each migrant worker will have to pass a Russian examination.
For the time being, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service, housing, services to individuals and retail.
However, over time, the Federal Migration Service promises that tests will become mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, knowledge of the language will have to be validated, but also that of the history of Russia and the foundations of law.
It will have to validate its language knowledge in Russian to obtain and renew its work permit.
Only nationals of countries where Russian has official language status shall be exempt.
Persons who received certificates or diplomas before the fall of the USSR in 1991 are also not covered by this Act.
Benefits, negative attitude and protection of rights
The Network of Review Centres will be under the auspices of the Russian-language Institute Pouchkine, the University of Peoples' Friendship, the Moscow State University, the St. Petersburg State University and other higher education institutions in Russia.
Immigrants will be able to pass the examinations in all cities in the country: more than 160 centres have already been opened throughout the country.
This initiative to introduce examinations was supported by members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service.
But, before the law comes into force, human rights defenders have already on many occasions asked the question in the press: what will it give?
What will the obligation to know Russian change for Russians and immigrants?
First, they respond to the representatives of the Migration Service, which will reduce the number of people suffering from "slavery at work".
Many speak of defending the rights of migrant workers, explains the director of the Russian Federal Migration Service office in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.
Protection of rights must begin before departure.
Only an organized selection system will solve the problems of foreign workers to 90%.
The problems arise for migrants without profession, without training, those who do not know the language and who do not have medical certificates.
Without the understanding of the language, according to Sebelev, the future migrant is destined to cross dishonest people who, for the sake of helping him, will provide a "travel" in an overcrowded house where he and dozens of his fellows will be tormented for months without food and without paper and will have to trim between 12 and 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
"They are promised one thing, and when they arrive, they are deceived, they take their passport, and they do not touch the expected salary," confirms the Head of the Migration Services Directorate for the work of the migration service in Tajikistan, Tolib Charipov.
Don't argue with me, officer!
However, many of the Central Asian republics who wish to make money in Russia are confident that they do not only know the language of the country they wish to visit, but also write with difficulty in their own language.
It is not their fault, of course, but their misfortune: little Turkmenes, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to follow would only be a passive primary education.
Indeed, their families don't even have to feed their children without talking about dress properly and equip them for school.
As soon as they reach adolescence, these young people leave to earn money as soon as the opportunity occurs.
It's hard when we don't know the language, they trust.
"You feel reduced and you're losing."
However, human rights defenders note an important aspect of the law on language.
The examinations will be for migrants with legal status only.
Without a statute, there will be no formal examination or work subsequently.
However, most migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or defend to enter"
Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The administrative barriers and always these language difficulties.
Furthermore, legalization costs money: between 12 and 16 miles rubles.
And then, you can get a fake record quickly for only 1,500 rubles.
Russian police know that we have false documents, that we don't have a record, so cases of extortion.
"They ask us 100, 200 rubles, what to buy cigarettes, tea," told journalists Oumed Khouchkadamov, a Tajik national.
"Do it quickly, don't read and buy yourself a beautiful work of art"
From the first day of the entry into force of the Language Act, it was found that the registration papers of migrants were not the only ones to be false.
Several false language examination certificates have already been confiscated by employees of the Federal Migration Service.
The falsified paper comes from an ordinary color printer.
Of course, their new owners did not have them for nothing: each migrant who had hoped to facilitate the task of the examinations had to pay seven thousand rubles for this document.
This is twice and a half more expensive than the official procedure: it will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles.
Power representatives and human rights defenders agree that the short-term goal is to protect the system from corruption so that it is impossible to simply buy these "paper tips".
The authorities may give migrant workers who were unable to validate the examination of the first time to attend language courses.
In addition, immigrants who do not know Russian will be offered work in areas that do not involve active communication with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not deal with the arms market
The share of crimes involving legal weapons is very low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior proposes to tighten the law against civilian arms carriers.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: whether it be the shootings carried out at the weddings or the killing organized by the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, who killed seven people.
The police want to ban the wearing of rubber bullets in public places and raise the legal age of obtaining the permit from 18 to 21 years.
The idea was supported by the head of the Douma Security and Anti-Corruption Committee, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that the amendments to the Arms Act would be introduced to the State Douma shortly.
Everyone is not satisfied that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by "closed the screw".
An open letter appeared on the Net in which its authors, representatives of various shooting centres, demanded to abandon "this senseless hardening".
The percentage of crimes committed with a recorded weapon is minimal, said to the Russian office Vasiliy Lesnikov, a criminal lawyer and specialist for the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, over a period of six months in 2012, 142 crimes were committed with a firearm registered in the police services, while 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded during the same period.
The authors of the open letter are certain that strengthening civil arms laws will not prevent criminals from supplying themselves to the black market .
According to them, any weapon can be found in Moscow today for a reasonable price.
However, the Ministry of the Interior asserts that it controls the spread of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factory to officer
The black arms market is provided via several channels.
The main channels are five, says Victor Baranets, a retired colonel who served ten years in the Ministry of Education and in the Headquarters.
Screenshot taken from a site using arms controls
The first is "the military trace", that is, the weapons that were stolen during military operations in the Caucasus.
"These weapons were stolen by the Russian officers, but also by the Caucasians," says Baranets.
The second type of weapons from the black market are those that were taken away by criminals from the law enforcement forces.
Baranets explains that these are both weapons stolen in police stocks and those directly derogated to law enforcement officials.
Illegal guns are on sale from military warehouses.
Many of these have often suffered explosions.
"Affiliated versions indicate that some fires have been set in motion to conceal the deficit," said the former military officer.
For Baranets, weapons manufacturers are there for something.
"We see private arms factories that do not compete with competition in the international market and spread weapons in the black market, especially in Moscow," said one expert.
One of the other sources of the black market is smuggling.
A large part of guns and machine guns come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a local production, sometimes artisanal, a mafia has trained and organized the supply," the former military said.
Where's the guns coming from?
Experts assessed the approximate share of each source of illegal weapons in the black market.
A report on this issue was produced in 2011 by the Centre for Analysis of Problems and Study for Public Administration.
Specialists have analyzed reports from the Ministry of Interior and Rosstat, criminal records and public data from arms portals.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, explain the researchers, come from the army and the forces of order.
Half of the weapons on the black market have been found "because of employees whose work is related to arms", the report explains.
According to researchers, 17% of the weapons come from military conflict sites, 14% are stolen at the time of manufacture and 5% are derived from " clandestine sheets".
A seller and consultant of an armory who has asked to keep the anonymity ensures that for a long time no one has been buying the weapons found by these underground search specialists; they are too old.
Most often, he says, the sellers will look for the new goods in the military warehouses.
The person buys through a sign a unit, e.g. a TT gun.
We deliver it to her by passing the goods through a grill.
"He transports it to the city and resells it for 900 € per unit with two shippers," he says.
"It is true that the police are aware of all cases, so, when crimes are about to be elucidated, they make a purchase of control from illegal arms dealers," he adds.
"Like in a luxury shop "
The seller and buyer are generally found through knowledge.
I consulted websites, blogs, until a guy showed up and offered to come to Begovaya station where someone had to take me to a "coin" to market.
The gun price, I got it on site.
Victor Baranets as a military observer
To find a gun, I need to know someone who has a contact, explain to the seller. I know someone, but I don't trust him.
There are vendors in the markets, but there is also a need to come, for example, by saying, "On the part of such a person, who asked me to transmit that his daughter has lost a tooth."
Now I even buy a pair of American fists with the help of someone I trust.
He only delivers them to me because he knows I won't.
The new ones are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military officer Victor Baranets tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he was preparing to publish an article on the subject.
The patterns, according to him, have not changed.
He was given a photo album in which there was "all we want".
"I believed in a luxury store," the military remembers.
There's no secret for the buyer, Baranets explains, we can try everything.
As a potential customer, I'm not content to buy, we're going with the forest vendor and we're installing a target.
"They let me shoot and when I'm convinced that the weapon works well, we start negotiating," the expert says.
A store from its couch
Search engines display sites and groups on Vkontakte where we can buy weapons "for different uses".
For this, there is no need for documents and no one to meet.
"Just have to have a precise amount of money," we put it in advertising on the "Buying a Gun or a Combat Gun."
Users leave their requests and ask their questions.
And we sell to minors?
"Without permission, of course," asks the user "Ivan" (orthograph preserved).
"Buy TT. Moscow," writes "Fedorenkov" in his very direct request.
The Federal Security Service has disseminated a vast network of false sites and has brought to the fore people who want to buy weapons of combat.
People run on food like hungry wolves and then they find themselves exploiting coal in Siberia

I have heard about this kind of scheme: generally, the site is registered outside the scope of the Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer makes the payment on the automatic terminals.
"He receives back a photo and instructions indicating where the weapon is hidden," explains the secretary of the association "Right to a weapon", Dmitry Kislov.
Victor Baranets says that by applying on the site, you can find yourself without a gun and behind bars.

One Makarov for $100
The purchase of an illegal firearms, experts estimate, can cost between $100 and 900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the "Right to a Gun" association, one can buy a Makarov pistol for $100-300.
We'll have to wait about a month and a half.
It came out of long-term warehouses through the management of these medium-sized warehouses.
According to the Department's official data, compared to the period January-October 2011, the overall number of these crimes decreased by 7% in Russia and reached 22.9 miles, while the proven cases of theft and extortion of arms, ammunition, explosive substances and bombs fell by 7.8%.
United States: Fast Food and Supermarket Employees in Strike · Global Voices
Nearly a quarter of American teenagers go through cashier work at McDonald's.
In recent days, a wave of protests has come up against the low wages practiced by Walmart supermarkets and famous fast catering chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
For the time being, no one can predict whether this wave is going to grow or sink rapidly.
These actions are supported by the unions and a number of left-wing associations.
In parallel to the increase in the modest wages of basic employees at Walmart and in fast-paced catering chains, the event organizers want to obtain the creation of trade unions.
This sector is not currently covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week, after Thanksgiving, the "Black Friday" at the time when a delinquent rain of balances with millions of inhabitants fell over America and sometimes sparking sparkles.
On that day, some employees of Walmart, who are employed in the world by 2.2 million people, left their positions to organize strike pickets with trade unions and left-wing activists in the shops of the society whose products are intended for consumers of modest and medium-sized classes.
Walmart sells everything: layers with hunting rifles through car batteries, vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
On average, there are 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That is why many poorly paid employees at Walmart are only running at their workplace.
The price and choice of products made Walmart one of the most powerful groups in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell its cheap products, especially because of the low wages of its employees.
They also complain about difficult working conditions, such as the lack of lifts or portable scanners.
The participants of the "Black Friday" protests demanded an increase in wages, complained that the price of the medical insurance provided by the company had increased from $30 to $100 per month.
For the basic employee at Walmart who pays $9.5 an hour, it's an amount he can't afford.
Scientists at the California University of Berkley demonstrate that if Walmart increased the average salary to $12 per hour, it would cost the group $3.2 billion.
It is 1.1% more than it currently spends.
If Walmart transferred all the salary increases on the consumer's shoulders, each race in the store would return them to 46 cents more.
They will spend only $12.39 in one year more than now.
The Walmart supporters noted with satisfaction that the protests took place in only nine States and did not bring any harm to the group.
The "Black Friday" continued in stores from 8am to midnight the following day and Walmart sold 5000 items to the second.
His caisses have made a total of 100 million transactions for the Black Friday.
The spokesperson for Dan Fogleman assured in an interview at the left-wing Huffington Post that in all "less than five" Walmart employees had left their positions and that the protest was only a "operation of as among so many others" on the part of the organizing union.
Next customer!
The protests continued this week in New York and also concerned Walmart shops (in this progressive city, they are not very appreciated, that is why they are not yet implemented) but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's announces selling billions of portions and after they don't even give you sick leave and don't pay you the job you did honestly!
Jumaane Williams, member of the City Council of New York
Currently, the minimum wage under federal and New York legislation is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food increases them over time, but on average, its basic employees reach $8.90 per hour in New York.
No one touches less than them in this city.
For me it's inconceivable to live with this money in New York.
It was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers worked at McDonald's after high school while living at their parents.
Few people saw their main source of income or wished to stay there for a long time.
Today, I find myself interviewing employees of McDonald's who complain about having to live with this salary and sometimes having to feed their children with it.
On the other hand, on the Wall Street Journal forum we find comments saying it is irresponsible to make children if you don't know what you're going to feed them with.
Protesters who launched the movement on Thursday at 6:30 p.m. near McDonald's on 40th Street and on Madison Avenue required that fast-food cashiers and cooks be paid at least $15 per hour, a multiplication of more than twice the current minimum wage.
They also called for trade unions to be created in the fast food industry.
The U.S. law prohibits the administration from obstructing it and punishing the protesters of a union by crackdowns or dismissals.
However, administration rarely simplifies their lives.
For a union, taking care of fast restoration remains a difficult task, and that, for concrete reasons.
One of the main is the extraordinary rotation of staff.
They don't agree
Other tumultuous manifestations were held near several other fast-paced catering channels.
The highlight of the protest was the mid-day rally near the McDonald's of Times Square with the intervention of several local democratic policies, including that of Jumaane Williams, a member of the City Council, who said: "McDonald's announced to sell billions of portions and after they don't even give you sick leave and do not pay you the work you have done honestly!".
The demonstrators were supported by other New York democrats in view, including the candidate for Mayor Bill De Blasio's position, who said that "we all have to support employees in the quick restoration to obtain a fair salary and economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves.
The New York Times characterized this event as the most important event in the fast-paced restoration industry in its entire history.
But only a few hundred people participated in it, not to mention that not all were fast-food employees, who employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is hard to tell if this mass motion spark will make small ones.
"At the moment, we only get half to fool the brain"
Recently, fans of new technologies have become accustomed to perceive the increased reality through special glasses.
At first, it was Google who unveiled this summer its current model at its annual conference and in November it was learned that Microsoft had applied for the patent.
However, it is clear from the interview with the director of the interactive 3D technology group of the Microsoft Laboratory of Cambridge, Shahram Izadi, that for the scientists of this society, the glasses are already from ancient history.
They are tempted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the naked air, by creating open virtual spaces.
- Could you please tell us in a few words what your research group is doing?
- We work on the interaction between man and machine and we try at the same time to widen the boundaries of this interaction.
Humanity as a whole has for the moment remained in pixels on flat screen and sometimes on touch.
We want to look 5-10 years ahead of us and guess the radical changes that will happen with this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is sold today without Kinect because everyone is interested in the command by the gesture.
- What does the future also hold for us?
- Although Kinect made physical interaction, many things happen on flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of the information has been improved (the system receives more data), but the performance, for the time being, is not really.
We're trying to change this and we're working on truly 3D imaging systems working on different technologies, especially projection technologies.
We need to get the computer world out in our physical world to make it more touchable.
For this, however, it is necessary to identify not only the user, but also the space around it.
Thus, we can complement the real world with virtual objects in a more practical form.
And to start with, let's get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
She's appreciated, but isn't she overestimated?
It cannot be said that this is the panacea: the question of confidentiality arises because one does not always want to inform others of its actions or intentions.
In fact, each type of interaction with the computer is good, but each one in his niche.
For example, to order the devices in public places, we had a project for which we thought of gestures, not large gestures, but rather discreet, restricted gestures.
The gestures were not captured by the camera, but by a wristband that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is currently large, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to the size of a watch.
In fact, the future will be marked by the mixed order, for example: gesture + voice.
- Is that so?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass this cane?
You would do it with the word and with the gestures.
- Usually, I'm just talking.
- Oh, it's gonna be hard to recognize.
- So you want to force users to adapt to what the machine can or can't do at any given time?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual rapprochement.
I think that very soon we will have to work on developing new types of sensors that will enable us to better identify man's reactions.
These may include laser sensors, they produce a fairly good resolution in depth, and this is very important.
- If we're interested in your work on Xbox Kinect sensors, what do you not like in modern cameras?
Do they lack resolution, depth or anything else?
- In principle, it is the current generation that we base ourselves on our work on 3D recognition.
Of course it would be good to get about 8 megapixels at a speed of 1000 c/s.
But the problem is not megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
In relation to this last point, all the current technologies are quite good, this adds work to the designers of algorithms.
The resolution should be kept in mind according to the X and Y axes, but also Z.
The speed also means a lot, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and 30 c/s do not really suffice, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our Redmond laboratory, gave the sensor touch a regular delay in treatment between 1 and 100 μs, with current sensors closer to the second value (60-100).
Everyone does not understand how this influences the interaction of man and machine.
I'd really need this type of device in my work, but I don't need to touch it, to have more executives at the second.
- But don't you have to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is in fact an infrared transmitter and the second, a receiver of the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually a regular sensor of the visible field.
It does not serve to define the depth of the object.
A lot of cameras could solve this problem...
Or stack it by increasing the required volume of calculations.
It would be interesting to create a flexible product similar to Kinect, play with the camera curve and see how it could help define locations.
- As long as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present his glasses to the public.
Do you not think that from a point of view of the daily use of technology of the enhanced reality, the glasses are one of the platforms with the most perspectives?
- Of course, walking around with a smartphone the raised hands is not practical, but here's what I think: the best option would be an increased "transitory" reality that would allow you from a cloud platform to switch glasses to the smartphone.
The glasses are a very personal device and that is what makes them strong (the personal elements are the ones you are the only to see) and at the same time their weakness: the increased reality from the glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is only accessible to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to the mere mortal.
There is a problem on which opponents of this idea point their finger: there is no touch sensation!
Hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my courses, I often say that the increased reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth could very well be adding touch sensations.
For the moment, one of the interesting techniques is the use of the second hand to serve as image support.
It records the pressures perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are really meant to attribute palpability to these "air images": for example, the interference of several ultrasonic rays towards a specific point where the finger is located and which gives you the sensation, for the still weak moment, of a breath of air on the ends of the fingers.
There are also bracelets on wrists that influence the nerve endings of the fingers, they are also an axis of work with perspectives.
- And you tried to deceive the brain?
Make him think he feels what he should normally feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried yet.
There is still a task below which it will take a long time to get hurt: the way to make someone physically in a very small space that he walks in an almost infinite open space - we are working on the concepts of race rugs (they are to be seen with those found in fitness clubs), mobile platforms and also giant balls.
At the moment, only half of the brain is deceived, there are still many years of work left.
This is what makes work on virtual reality so interesting for the researcher: many things are still in the absolute state of fertilization.
The king of taste and not of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "La vanguarde petersbourgeois" dedicated to the citizens who are in advance, at the vanguard of culture and art.
This ultra-selective list has already welcomed prominent actors from the St. Petersburg art scene whose achievements go beyond the city border and who have found recognition in Europe, after being known throughout Russia.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extravert painter Kirill Miller.
The whole town knows Kirill Miller, this rather barbu man, all of red clothes that can be crossed near the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden or at the connected festivals and varnishes.
Kirill Miller's paintings always gather the crowds, no matter where they are exposed.
He is one of the deeply social and philosophical petersbourgeois counters, one of the founders of the new myths.
Kirill Miller is a prominent representative of the Petersburg vanguard in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
It is also the symbol of the city, its appearance makes the inhabitants smile and makes them in good mood.
He recently took into his hands a Barbarian organ and became the symbol of this instrument in St. Petersburg as he had matured enough for this difficult role of his existence, his philosophy and his Bohemian image.
- Kirill, why do you travel the city all red and not in yellow or turquoise blue, for example?
- I chose the red as a tailor specializing in the look and the image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the painter, the image creator and society.
Even though in society, anything that is not grey causes aggression and negative agitation.
But my provocations are intended to start the discussion.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to the discussion.
- And when did you realize you were supposed to be a painter?
- At the exhibition of the Palace of Nevskiy Culture where my work was.
I understood it was my way.
Then the wave of the old unofficial painters had passed and the new, free, in my kind, were misunderstood.
I started associating with the painters of the new wave, with those of the Postgazonevchtchina who gave birth to "Puchinskaya-10" and then there was no wave.
I am interested in theatre, fashion, music, all kinds of things except words.
It was important for me to find myself in the heart of St. Petersburg's culture where the best creative forces have to meet.
In 1995, I took place in Pouchkinskaya-10, which was home to a musical and artistic club, a Bohemian club, the house of the Bohemian bohemian.
Many were born there: The NOMs, Tequila-jazz, I still see Chnour arrive with the project "Van Gogh's Ear".
Chnour and his friends sang easy play-back songs in mottling jerseys, among them Igor Vdovin, a fashion composer today.
When the group began to occur live, it became "Leningrad".
Trakhtenberg did not badly animate emissions before the time of Hali Gali.
We gave them Trakhtenberg and that's when his big career began, but his basic education and training, he received them at home.
Galerie "D137", Club "Griboiedov": these are impacts of the Artistic Clinic.
Our employees left as usual.
I'm a hero of the past century, when culture meant something.
In 2000, a survey was organized in the press: it was the prize "The personalities of our city".
I was called "Paint of the Year," and that's when my kingdom ended.
It is not convenient to work in a new era with old rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today, it's easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, you can be popular, but not really a culture person.
- Your work is characterized by a recognisable style.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they have a very strong news and acuity.
I'm going to have a programmed exhibition "The Russian Museum Through the Clowns".
Clowns belong to a timeless category.
Before I was a social person, today it hurts and it scares me to be like this.
But with the clowns, it's all gone, the tragic falls.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the idea of saving the world through total and mandatory disguise.
Today, it is habit that matters, we are interested in the external mechanism, but not inside the person.
Maybe we can't give him a hand, but we should crack him in the trunk.
And the lie will be erased by disguise.
- We've recently seen you in the role of the Barbarian organ player.
Who else I can play.
- But maybe commercial art can also be beautiful?
- Today, commercial art must be treated, delicate, liqueurous.
The disintegration of the culture is occurring.
Before, people were divided into herds, the supporters of the bohemian loved one thing, they denied another.
Today, everything is divided into micro-community, it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred dollar ticket to please everyone.
Today, we have to think about who you're going to like.
Each star has 100 fans.
- But thousands of people come to see Stas Mikhailov!
- They're people we threw out who came to see him, it's the sexual and social side that's walking.
But on the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 miles will not come and ultimately it's less management, money, everything perishes.
I have my fans, the main thing is not to deceive them, not to waste their lives.
When I was young, I combed the paintings that a collector hung next to Falk or Larionov.
I started with the paintings that usually are the ones we paint at the end of life.
Today, ideas are often confused.
It is said: there is spiritual culture, the culture of consumption.
Consumption has no culture, it has nothing to do with it.
I'm a representative of yesterday's culture, I grew up with the example of painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty and who rejected money just for painting.
I'm for this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is this concept: the grievor of culture.
But everyone can't work in culture.
Under the rule of the good tsars, it was not like that, the tsars did not understand culture well, but they understood that it was necessary to keep good experts.
In Moscow, there are good consultants today.
We have people here in St. Petersburg who could be experts, but they are far from there, because there is a need for higher experts who will properly assess these experts and help them find a way.
Currently, it is the "reign of taste" that blooms.
The same Erarta, but they differ in the sense that they honestly say they don't take all contemporary art, that there are painters who have to find other museums.
- What is St. Petersburg for you?
- Saint Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is a soil for it.
And on our stones, art has a hard time growing.
We need a cultural soil and we have more writers than readers, it's bad.
In Europe, there are many curious people who will see exhibitions, concerts.
In us, this layer is very fine.
We have to turn art into fashion as was the case at the beginning of the last century.
Project carried out with the support of the St. Petersburg Fellowship
Hide in Space
The Earth is in danger.
Climate warming or collision with a deadly asteroid.
Space shuttle caravans with land on board are searching for a rescue planet.
To save mankind, a big question arises: how can we continue to live our species as a sucker or on a rescue planet?
I don't think there's much to choose.
There are, in fact, two real planets that can be conquered, would only be assumed.
"This is Venus and Mars," says Vladimir Sourdine, researcher at the State Astronomical Institute P.K. Chternberg (GAICH).
If on Mars the conditions are more suitable for life, the temperature on the Venus surface is 500 .
We can only live there at very high altitude or on Venus' orbit... in space.
We began to take an interest in the issues of reproduction in space by focusing on flora.
Another half century ago, experiments were being carried out on plants.
Four generations of small peas grown on orbit did not differ in any way from land varieties.
Then, insects were put on orbit, small drosophilous reproductive flies.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent to space to see how an embryo developed into a sucker.
We get a very normal chick at the exit.
Then the problems begin.
"The problem is related to the fact that the chicks must find a support, they must get on their feet and start moving," explains the Director of the Laboratory of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IMBP) Vladimir Sychev.
When no support was found, the chicks were in a disorderly way.
And at the end of 10 hours, the newborns saw their instincts completely atrophied.
The chicks did not react to either light or sound.
Unfortunately, they would just die after four days.
"We evicted their eyes twice, then we gave up, because it's simply impossible to work with them there," explains Vladimir Sychev, noting the failure of the experience with the chicks in space.
The last biological miniature ark with animals was sent on orbit 16 years ago.
Experiences will continue in spring 2013.
However, the "Bion" biosatellite will only board species of the same sex.
There was an experiment with rats sent with their fetuses into space.
In principle, nothing supernatural was discovered.
"It was still biosatellites, and then it was the only experience. We have to do this kind of research," says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the rats of space gave birth to their offspring.
However, it is not yet possible to reproduce directly in space.
It's not a fucking business.
By losing their usual environment, animals are no longer able to achieve their sexual instincts.
Unlike the beasts, man is able, in principle.
Homo sapiens has abstract thought, it is able to create a suitable emotional background.
This type of experience is not achieved for ethical reasons.
But women have been in space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was taken by Terechkova.
And the female organism is what humanity has most precious.
Our whistle flew and no one on Earth could tell if it would hold after a flight into space.
If she could have given birth to a child after the flight.
"No one answered this question," explains Vakhtang Vitchnadzé, retired from the rocket and space sector.
In June 1964, just one year after her flight into space, the first cosmonautist woman Valentina Terechkova gave birth to a little girl.
The father of the child, Andrian Nikolayev was also cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, after having been on orbit and even worked in an extra-vehicular environment, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk remains.
We have few, even very few cosmonauts who have had nothing and give birth to a healthy offspring after long flights.
"And if they are longer, this presents a danger even during orbit flights," concludes the pilot and cosmonaut, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of Russia, Valeriy Poliakov.
Yet, humanity must look for new solutions in biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
Hydrology Laboratory of the Cosmonaut Preparation Centre: mandatory step of flight preparation.
Here, in zero floatability, cosmonauts lead to extra-vehicular outputs.
The water imitates the sprinkling.
If for adults, water is comfortable but a foreign environment, for infants, it is their real element.
Small amphibians seem to confirm this: life on Earth comes from the ocean.
To the extent that the baby evolves about 9 months in the lymphatic liquid of his mother's belly, it is easier for him to get used to water later.
It's in principle logical, because from his birth to his first bath, he only spends 2 weeks.
"It's very little to forget," explains the infant swimming instructor, Marina Aksenova.
In short, if for the child who has just been born the appendage is a more natural state, the woman needs gravitation, a force of weight.
In the patient, the muscles of the belly, the basin are atrophied very quickly, the baby's ability to push is lost.
All right, let's ignore this by relying on the delivery simulators.
Of course we can prepare a delivery in a special room, the woman will get him out.
"And then?" asks Valeriy Poliakov to invite you to think about this complex issue.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
If he does not feel earthly attraction, the body does not form the skeleton or muscle system.
You can't dress a baby like an adult with a special combination for workouts.
He will simply be deprived of his vital needs.
"And this experience that we would consider in this case by imagining the birth of a child in a foreign environment will result in the return to Earth of a disabled child, completely disadapted," says the Director of the Bioethics Committee of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
The birth of children in space is still a matter of theory.
However, in time this will become reality, when the Terriens will travel in their shuttles to a distant planet that will become the habitat of their born offspring in space.
The head of the ISC (High Institute for Public Finance Control) said: "the control of self-employment (in Czech " Švarc system ") has failed because of politicians.
In the area of public procurement, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and quality legislation, but it is on the verge of its application.
This is what Miloslav Kala, Vice-President of the Higher Institute for Public Finance Control, said in an interview with Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and, in my opinion, that is what is lacking in us," said Kala in her commentary to the current situation.
Joint monitoring by Czech and German inspectors also suggests similar conclusions.
He cites as an example of abusive practice the approach of the " Švarc system " by Petr Nečas.
Mr. Prime Minister recently stated that ODS was not going to import contractors with controls; is it therefore allowed or prohibited?
"The law must be enforced in one way or another, so if it prohibits anything, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority to inspect compliance," says Kala.
At the Board of Deputies meeting, you referred to a Czech-German project in which the laws on public procurement of these two countries were compared.
What was the specific issue?
This is a parallel control that we launched about two years ago.
In simple terms, European legislation provides for the way in which public procurement and specific national legislation are managed and the practice itself is being followed.
We have gathered all this and although this control procedure has not yet been completed, very interesting differences have appeared to us: generally speaking, our legislation is perhaps "more severe and better quality", however, according to some parameters, practice like this is better in Germany.
This confirms, therefore, that it is not enough to continuously develop more and more detailed rules but that it is necessary to devote itself to the implementation of the law itself.
How can this project help you effectively and what is the result for you?
Common control of this type should contribute to our stopping efforts to clarify laws, lower and improve thresholds, when this does not have a truly positive effect.
The principle of good management means getting the thing in question at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest), in order to exclude any enrichment and possible criminal activity.
But by lowering market thresholds, we will not necessarily achieve this goal.
It may be that this system is at such a point submerged by paperwork, that those who seek its faults will find much more opportunities than if the threshold had remained above.
You are talking about internal problems relating to the implementation of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an institution similar to our ISC or a different way of organizing?
With regard to institutions, similar to the ISC, the Bundesrechnungshof operates there, which is organised similarly, it also has a Council which is a little different, but these two institutions basically proceed in a similar manner.
The competences are also, to some extent, similar, with a nuance to our system: Germany being a federal structure, so it also has such accounts at the level of the various Länder.
The HRB can only control federal money, which corresponds to the resources of the state.
The public funds managed by the regions and municipalities are controlled there at the Länder level.
As far as national legislation is concerned, is it simpler than ours?
I would not like to make a general comparison without concrete data, however, in some areas Germany is often designated as a model but it is certainly not possible to say that it is doing better in all areas.
Could it be due to the fact that they have better inspectors?
No, certainly not, but I repeat, I do not have comparison data.
However, it must also be said that this country, which we consider to be a model, is also facing a whole range of problems.
Otherwise they wouldn't have any advantage in cooperating with our institution, would they?
As far as national legislation is concerned, what has meant for you, as an institution, the amendment of the Public Procurement Act, its effects have already been felt?
As this amendment entered into force relatively recently, it has not yet had an impact on our control operations.
As we do a posteriori controls, we have to have a certain delay.
Our comments are only for the moment about the process of preparing future controls - we have launched a new instrument for "detection of the risk of mismanagement" with which we have screened almost 14 000 public contracts - these changes will of course be felt, because the thresholds have been modified as well as the conditions of certain types of tender procedures and so on.
Are you therefore considering the adoption of this law rather as an advantage or as an additional burden for administration?
I believe that this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that the future will confirm it.
The problem that may arise is that these rules become stricter and that they cannot be respected.
Already under the previous regulatory regime, the claimant (e.g. the regional council, in the case of regional operational programmes) forced controlled subjects to accept that any violation of the law on markets means a failure to budgetary discipline.
Is it therefore really useful to make the law stricter in this way?
No, not like that, I think.
The system should exclude those who want to attack or abuse the system but not punish those who commit unreasonably formal errors in the decision-making process.
Such a system will put pressure on administration.
So what's the solution to that?
Let's look where we're not going.
Recently, the Prime Minister stated that the SDO would not import contractors with controls of the so-called Švarc system - what does that mean?
Is the Švarc system prohibited or authorized?
The law must be enforced in one way or another, so if it prohibits anything, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority to inspect and require compliance with the law.
He can say, "We're going to change the law and authorize it," but he can't say that we're going to act like nothing was.
The Contracts Act contains relatively strict rules on the formalities to be carried out, precisely in order to protect the call for tenders.
But it is also tragic that a bidder is eliminated only because of formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and it is, in my opinion, lacking in us.
The roads are frozen, but most of them remain viable.
In some parts of the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and also snow-flaked.
However, the network remains largely practical, in some places with increased vigilance.
Karlovy Vary Region
In the Karlovy Vary area, the roads were practical this morning, but by frozen and also snowy places.
Temperatures have fallen and oscillate between -5 and -10 °C but should slightly rise during the day.
Snowfalls have ceased in the region and it remains in the plains only a fine layer of snow.
The ridges of the Metalliferous Mountains (Krušné hory) are, however, covered by about 30 centimeters of snow.
Data from the Regional Road Maintenance Service indicate that due to fog, visibility was reduced in places.
The R6 fast track and national roads in the region are now unhindered.
Vigilance, however, remains on certain bridges, for example, where the coating can be frozen and sliding.
All departmental roads and third-class roads, including mountain roads, are also feasible.
There are still some of their sections of frozen snow and traffic-stricken areas.
Especially in high-altitude areas, drivers need to strengthen their vigilance.
Regions of Pardubice and Hradec Kralové
The Roads and Highways Directorate reports on its website that some roads in East Bohemia are threatened by the formation of greens and that snow layers from traffic can be found on the roads in mountain areas and at altitudes.
The road maintenance services warn drivers against the risk of glass formation in areas in the Pardubice region at altitudes.
There may be vegetables in the vicinity of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy or Vysoké Mýto, mainly on departmental and third-class roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34 around Svitavy have been treated chemically.
The snow is mainly found in the Giant Mountains (Krkonoše) and the Eagle Mountains (Orlické hory).
In the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov, a layer of traffic-tagged snow is present on the roads in the high-altitude areas.
In East Bohemia, the weather will be dry today, most often clear, with possible cloudy passages.
It will blow a weak wind and temperatures will generally vary between -3° and +1°C.
Pilsen Region
The roads in the Pilsen region are now feasible, although, in places, there is a need to be greater vigilance and to adapt its conduct to weather conditions.
It freezes this morning, temperatures range from -3 ° to -9 ° C.
After the last snowfalls and the ensuing cooling, some channels of communication may be frozen places.
Drivers can expect to cross fog zones, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is what the regional road maintenance service has to say.
Highway D5 can be practised almost without difficulties, however, the road maintenance services recommend increased vigilance between kilometres 80 and 131.
The coating of most national roads is dry and frozen.
Some sections can be frozen in the Pilsen-Sud district and in the Tachov district.
Departmental and third-class pathways are wet and in this case caution is applied against frozen sections.
Drivers must be vigilant, especially on the less frequent roads in the Šumava region.
Olomouc Region
Drivers arriving in the Olomuc area at altitude must now have a thick and soft snow layer on the roads.
This layer remained on the col called "Červenohorské sedlo" and on the road towards Videlský kříž, after chemical treatment operations.
The snowfalls forced road maintenance personnel to travel on the ground this night; according to road management services, it fell more than three centimeters in the Šumperk district.
In the other parts of the region, most footwear can be practised without any difficulty.
" On the heights of Šumperk district there are traces of snow.
Drivers moving towards Jeseník must expect to meet at col "Červenohorské sedlo" a thick, soft snow layer," said today to ČTK the head of road maintenance services in Šumperk district.
Their colleagues in the Jeseník district also visited the scene at night; according to the latter, after chemical treatment, the roads are now clear and wet, even in the highest areas.
In the district of Olomouc, roads can be practised without difficulty, in the district of Šternberk drivers should, however, be careful in the sections in forest areas on wet roads.
Regions of Ustí nad Labem and Liberec
As early as this morning, North Bohemian road maintenance has reported several difficult sections.
Data from the police show that, in addition to some snow-covered or freezing sites, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice na Ústecku is closed.
Temperatures will remain below zero at a lower altitude, and so snow and green should remain on the roads. In the plains, especially in the south-east of the central Bohemian Plateau, there is, on the contrary, no problems and roads are usually dry.
No traffic difficulties have been reported at the moment.
The road maintenance services reported the presence of greens, especially around Štětí.
According to meteorologists, night conditions were ideal for its formation: rain and snow fountain during the day, clear sky and ice during the night.
Since the main points of traffic, difficult conditions have also been reported on national road 13 to the border between the regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec.
The closure of the traffic between Telnice and Kninice is due to branches of trees that have bent under the weight of the snow to reach the pavement.
Šimon Ornest said: "In concert, we want to collect positive energy."
What do you think about the fact that in less than a month it should be the end of the world?
It's just one of these alarming news, the kind of trap we love to fall into.
In our group The Tap Tap, we are laughing at it rather and we are said to be the only group that can collect a positive amount of energy in order to push back or prevent the end of the world.
In addition, in December you set up a completely unique project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you present this project in more detail to our readers?
It is a charity that we have been preparing for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced for December 21 at 11 a.m. 10 a.m.
On the eve of 20 December, three concerts will take place simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end practically at the end of the Mayan calendar on the island of Kiribati in the peaceful ocean, on a 12-hour time zone ahead of us.
Who had that idea?
At first I think it was my idea, then we designed everything with our creator, Honza Augusta.
Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want together, with the public, to think about the state of the world we leave to our children.
At the end of the Maya calendar, we created a collection of unique objects, including shoes, T-shirts, bags, and original keys against the end of the world, buying them online at www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The Tap Tap group with other interpreters also recorded an hymn against the end of the world, which is called "End of the Canceled World" (in Czech " Konec světa zrušeno").
Is it already very popular on YouTube, will we also hear it during these charitable concerts?
Of course, at the end, finally, if we succeed and the end of the world does not take place...
It will be sung simultaneously by all performers in all three concerts.
The hymns will also join at some point in a live, completely unique, broadcast of Czech television.
The lyrics of this song were written by Tomáš Hanák who also plays the main role of Jesus in the clip, Xindl X also sings...
How did you come to cooperate with them?
We collaborate with other Czech show-biz personalities because we organize many concerts and charity events...
We are striving to get them to participate intensively in these projects.
It turned out that most of them are interested in such cooperation and that it amuses them.
What will be the benefits of these concerts against the end of the world?
To equip the Studeo Training Centre that is accessible to people with reduced mobility and which we have been working on within the Jedlička Institute, with the Tap Association, for six years.
Teachers come to the Jedličkův school regularly and offer activities that interest them and amuse them.
Students themselves do not have the means to attend classes, we are trying to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the construction of the Jedlička Institute, we will transfer this project to a new independent building.
Will several music groups and interpreters be on stage at each of these concerts?
Under what criteria did you choose them?
We have tried to develop a program for all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, they will ride Chinaski, Lesbians Support, Illustratosphere with Dan Barta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
Details are available at www.kpks.cz.
Are you also preparing for other "mega events" of this kind in the future?
In May, we will play for the first time in the spring of Prague; there too, we will surely prepare a quality program with interesting guests.
We would also like to play next year at the Czech Republic's home in New York and personally, once in the United States, I would like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimalist, so far you have played for example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is nevertheless a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage the organization and logistics of your tours?
It's not so terrible that it looks like it's first.
We have five members in an electric chair whose gears must travel in support, of course we also trip a lot of luggage and instrument boxes....
Until now everything has been more or less well past, ČSA and British Airways were always perfectly prepared for us, they surprised me more than once.
Even in Moscow, where we recently returned, everything went smoothly.
Through your travel abroad, you can compare how these countries differ in terms of access facilities for people with reduced mobility, the public attitude towards people with disabilities, and so on.
What have your experiences been up to now?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than we do, we have just witnessed in Moscow that it is still only in an initial phase.
In relation to Prague, Moscow is still very little accessible to people with disabilities; there, it is not yet common for a person to travel by himself in an electric chair in the center of the city.
They do not yet see it as evidence of giving priority to a wheelchair in an elevator.
Fortunately, there too, an association is trying to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities is being created.
What more must we catch up with the more developed countries?
There's a lot for which we're still late...
It is important to mention that improvements and improvements are still dependent on the efforts of the individuals concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with a heavy disability to move alone in public spaces; they can go to the toilets, to the museum, wherever they can...
It is not very common there that a large number of people with disabilities are actively involved in social life, on this point, you, The Tap Tap, are rather at the forefront of progress!
Public respect and access facilities are one thing, but the situation will really start to change when we have among us sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or famous lawyers.
At the moment, it is only isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
The Tap Tap Group is currently very popular, let's go back in a few years, what prompted you in 1998 to create this group?
I started working as an educator at Jedlička School, where I found myself surrounded by many young people ready to invest in something.
And since I am myself a musician (I play, among others, a saxophone), with a colleague, we created a music activity.
And then, in time, as our moderator Lá ,a Angelovič says, we have a little lost control of the situation (laughs).
Success has only happened in recent years, if I'm not mistaken?
It is true that creating links with well-known singers and working actively to promote the group helped us.
We understood that, if a job is not visible, it is as if it did not exist in the background.
Thanks to EU subsidies, we can also afford quality teachers, equipment, and so on.
Did you plan on reaching such a level with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt that there was a potential to change things.
The show business is full of things that copy each other.
In a way, that's logical: everything that's new is accepted with caution and it lasts a long time.
Rare are the original projects, and I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is naturally pity, it's natural...
But pity is totally useless, because people with disabilities are not suffering, abandoned by all, that we must take in pity.
They are people who can live a whole life and thrive, provided they have the necessary means of it, of course.
I often say that when people with disabilities come to realize something, it is not just an advance for them but for the whole society.
Is not your success also due to the fact that you are a demanding leader, as you are qualified by many people?
If we want to do quality work, we must be intransigent in many areas and require certain discipline.
But I think it's perfectly normal.
Some people come to our house with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and, when they realize that they must come to the rehearsals twice a week, follow the preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the roads for concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But it works in the same way in each group that wants to work and achieve goals.
The Tap Tap Group currently has twenty members.
How many of them were already there in 1998?
Only one, Laa Angelovič.
We're an open group, people come in and go, we can't do anything.
Our doors are always open to those who want or would like to join us.
This will be the day before the planned end of the world, on Thursday, December 20, 2012 from 21 o'clock.
This action will take place in Prague in the Incheba arena, in Brno in Fléda and in Ostrava in Plynojem with the participation of twelve groups and other musicians in the Czech Republic.
At the end of the evening, these three cities will be connected by audio-visual relays when the song of the group The Tap Tap " End of the cancelled world " will be sung together.
The aim of the concert is to gather financial resources (up to 25 million CZK) to equip the Studeo Multifunctional Training Centre located in Prague in the Jedlička Institute.
The price of a ticket at this concert is 400 CZK, the entrance is free for children up to 12 years, the ticket preview is open in Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of the Ministers of the European Space Agency countries, Poland was admitted as the twentieth member of the Agency, it was the second Member State of the former Eastern bloc (the Czech Republic became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland had undertaken close collaboration with ESA in 1994 and over the following years participated in a number of Agency projects.
However, the road from Poland to outer space began much earlier.
Already before the Second World War, passionate Poles worked on space flights; they did not always encounter understanding.
For example, I would like to refer to A. Šternfeld's conference at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory on 6 December 1933, in which he presented ideas drawn from his avant-garde work entitled "Introduction to Astroutics ".
The developments of this young engineer (born 1905) left the cold listeners and later years Šternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld obtained in France the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch award for his work "Introduction to Astroutics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great propagator of astronomy and astronomy.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish newspapers and wrote many books devoted to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski has become a propagator of world-renowned astronomicals, and his contribution has been rewarded in particular by the fact that his name has been given to one of the craters of the moon's hidden face.
As early as 1925, a dam was built in Poland to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, neither the author nor the details of this project are known.
Nor is it clear whether the rocket should be used to propel or to brake the drain.
The only known information on this root is that of the press of the time.
From 1933 onwards, the Polish artillery began to devote itself to the rockets.
The research was conducted by Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Professors Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustav Mokrzyckiego.
It appears from the preserved documents that this research has reached the test stage.
Of course, with the arrival of the German armies, research has ceased.
In 1937, the plans of a photographic hunting rocket, designed by the engineer Rohoziński, appeared in the specialized press and the following year the book "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" was published by a writer named Leliwy-Krzywoblocki.
These two projects had a military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, all projects for the use of rocket technology were conducted by the Interim Scientific Advisory Committee ("Tymczasowy Doradczo-Naukowy Committee"), which coordinated all the work.
This committee was established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the beginning of the war ended its activities.
After the war, other work on aeronautics was published in the Polish press, thanks to Polish astronomical society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, it is a question of a company in the November 1954 issue of the Journal Problem, in which there are four more detailed articles on aeronautics.
In one of these articles, written by Professor Subotowicze, it is proposed to create an astronomical company
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was clear that the field of space research had a future.
At the beginning of 1956, the Polish astronomical company (PTA) made efforts to enter the international astronomical federation (created in 1951) and as early as the fall, the PTA became a regular member.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became vice president of the international astronomical federation.
He remained in office until his death in 1959.
Starting in 1956, the PTA made a significant contribution to successful development of the RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna) meteorological rocket, which became the first Polish rocket to conduct scientific research.
The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
This rocket with a range of 1800 metres was 80 cm long and weighed a little less than 5 kg.
Subsequently, an improved version of RM-1A was built, and during the summer of 1959, flight tests of two-storey RM-2 were started in the Bledov Desert.
This rocket was 1.4 metres long and probably weighed 11.5 kg.
The next prototype should have been able to perform concrete scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should have had a range of up to 14.5 km and serve to observe the wind at altitude.
But in 1963 all the development work was halted.
The Meteor-1 rocket developed during the period 1962 - 1965, succeeded in the first MRI-type rockets.
This rocket, designed with two floors, had a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed; they were distinguished by the dimensions of the space reserved for scientific tools.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a space of 0.4 litres, while in Meteor-1B this volume was 0.34 litres and in Meteor-1C of 0.62 litres.
The maximum range of all such equipment was 37 km.
In the period 1965 - 1968, the Meteor-2 rockets were developed in the aeronautical institute, the first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a useful load of 10 kg at an altitude of about 60 km.
Later on, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
The entry of Poland into the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the establishment of a national committee COSPAR two years later.
Under the Interkosmos programme, Poland also participated in space exploration on artificial Soviet satellites and, in 1978, the Miroslaw Hermaszewski pilot became, after Vladimir Remek, the second non-Soviet cosmonaut of this program.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the law on public utility work.
This decision raised a serious discussion in public opinion.
It is undoubtedly interesting to look at this issue from a broader point of view.
Liberal-oriented economic systems, both in the EU and in the context of globalization, are based on the principle of more unregulated economic competition.
This actually means that the different economic entities and national economic systems are constantly in conflict with each other.
This is the result of the principle of freedom of trade and free movement (without limits) of private capital combined with financial speculation.
The considerable differences in labour prices (wages) generate price tension.
The following meaning must be put to an end: a producer is trying to import goods sold at low prices to resist economic competition by "making the price of the competitor more expensive" in order to remove a greater share of the market and thus increase its own profits.
On a large scale, this means for most entrepreneurs: either to transfer production abroad, to buy at low prices, or to disappear. The result is a major unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
Given that private capital has no social responsibility and hence responsibility for the unemployment generated by the private capital, the state's social burdens are necessarily increasing.
All of this reinforces the perfect unwillingness of the entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thus compensate for the economic and social damage caused to society as a whole by this race for the benefit of the company.
This situation is at such a public level that there is no need to provide concrete statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital create in the different economies a situation in which governments in different countries are forced to engage in a mutual competition in order to artificially lower the social level of their own people in order to attract foreign capital to their homes.
In other words, governments place their own people at the expense of private capital without regard for social collapse.
This appears primarily in the amendments to the laws in force.
The objective is to compel its own people to accept the private capital price diktat, particularly in the area of wages.
This occurs on the one hand by a system of economic constraints in the event of long-term unemployment and by the restriction of employees' rights in the field of labour law.
As a result, there is increasing poverty and deepening differences between the rich and the poor.
In RFA, there have been public food distribution points for the poor for years that cannot meet their needs with their own work.
The number of these people is already estimated at millions of times.
As part of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, it becomes quite common for employees to receive such wages that the state is obliged to pay an extra fee so that they can achieve the minimum life.
This scandal, for example, has been updated in the case of employees working as assistants to the federal parliament.
The economic measures of almost all the Member States of the south of the EU undoubtedly generate a similar situation in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced either to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century), or to live with poor wages, on the margins of society, in the hope that one day private capital will invest in their country.
Here is the question: where does that capital come from?
If it comes from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another; this capital may not come either, or then a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, a Turkish, a Moroccan, an Egyptian or African will continue to work for a fraction of a European salary.
This also applies to all Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media claim, at the same time, that the state cannot make capital investments in its own economy, that the economy leads to an economic disaster.
Private capital strongly supports the idea that the state cannot intervene in the economy through regulatory interventions.
The question is, then, whether private capital does not influence and, even today, does not govern, according to its own selfish interests, politics and by the same, the whole state.
The answer to this question is undoubtedly yes.
The evidence is that there is an almost all-powerful lobby present in all States.
As a result, a desperate situation arises in the area of corruption, by granting mutual benefits, in the legislation, where everything is punishable but not punishable.
In RFA, the situation is such that due to the lack of financial resources, national ministries delegate the development of draft laws to law firms closely related to industry.
These bills are then passed in the Bundestag.
The whole power comes not from the people, as the Western constitutions state, but from powerful financial groups serving their own interests.
It is evident that liberal-oriented democracies are now faced with the situation described by Appianos in his book "the crisis of the Roman Empire in the time of Caesar and Pompeii": "The state was long in delicence and the functions were attributed by violence.
The coups de pot-de-vine, the favors obtained illegally, and the stones and swords were also used to obtain these positions.
The underground and corruption proliferated without limits and the people went to the elections with voices already sold" ... ... "The honest people did not seek to obtain any functions, it resulted in once the state remained 8 months without consulates".... 'We really began to say that the remedy to this difficult situation was an autocratism and that it was necessary to choose an energetic man"... It is true that Appianos had in mind Pompée, but it is Caesar who irreversibly transformed democracy into an absoluteist regime.
In conclusion, as in antiquity, the present society is based on preference for personal profit, without regard for the interests of society as a whole.
In its essence, private capital is no longer able to understand and promote the interests of society as a whole.
Today, as in the past, this results in an unprecedented decline in elites, without any effort to carry out far-reaching reforms.
We must therefore look for the causes of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in the unscrupulous liberalization of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
In the present state of affairs, the disappearance of these systems can be seen as a kind of break before a new stage.
The fact that the current elites completely ignore the eventuality of hundreds of thousands of future loss in human lives, the humanitarian and social crises that we are now witnessing and the crimes against humanity as we know them from ancient and recent history.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution, at least in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both internationally and internally, the Government of the Czech Republic will continue to seek ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is indeed systemic.
The solution is socio-political reforms, which will strengthen state capital investments in the economy, increase citizens' influence on government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: laboratory of chaos.
"Nothing will ever come out of violence and never can" says Sting in the song called Fragile whose main verse of the saying is "don't forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons didn't want wars, there wouldn't have been any," said Gutele Schnaper, Mayer Amschel Rothschild's wife on her deathbed in 1849.
As a result of the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, many reactions have developed.
Some take the party of Israel, arguing for its right to self-defence and placing Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others support Palestinians, calling on the racism of the State of Israel, genocide committed against the Arabs of Palestine and calling Israel a terrorist state.
I do not want to think about the question of who is guilty and who is the victim, in his waves of recurring killings; all of it, the present inhabitants of Israel, including those of the autonomous territories, are born in this political situation and have not experienced the beginning of violence.
I would like to offer readers a "back the curtain" point of view, on the one to which they mainly enjoy the tensions that have continued for more than 95 years (as of the Balfour Declaration in 1917) in a small part of the Middle East.
Some of these reflections are based on historical facts available in the study, others come from my own understanding of the one, or more precisely from the group of individuals, which is the main instigator of the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is above all the history of a struggle for power.
At each time, we can find an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether these individuals acted independently or were due their actions to the throne to someone who was directing their actions according to previously defined objectives.
We must admit that we are living at a time when world wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this financial concentration, generating certain powers, has not been able to take place in a single generation.
Among families with an astronomical wealth, the Rothschild family is particularly distinguished, which could be considered the head of the puberty (I don't know if these families still have a leader but I don't exclude it).
Little is written about them.
Of course.
As early as the 1990s in the 19th century, they acquired the first world press agency (Reuters) to put an end to establishing links between their names and serious criminal acts to which they were involved and which had always meant to them an increase in their power, an increase in their wealth or both.
They have major stakes in almost most central banks in the world and are preparing or waging wars against countries in which they do not yet have such shares (before the invasion of Afghanistan the number of these countries was 7, after Iraq's invasion of 5, after the overthrow of Kadhafi only 4, in the meantime Russia placed the Russian central bank under the control of the Russian government).
Anyone who tried to stand up against this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the Bank of America of Rothschild's central bank status and began to issue his own money (government, I understand) during the civil war and was murdered in a theatre in 1865.
JFK began to issue clean money and wanted to dissolve the EDF, he was murdered in 1963, and MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 while he wanted to sue the EDF for having triggered the major economic crisis of 1929.
Their thirst for world power led in the 1859s to 1871s to the formulation of a three-world war plan by Albert Pike, a freemason initiated at the 33rd degree, being the highest level.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great state monarchies of Europe, the second was to remove colonialism, particularly British, and the third was to reduce the world's population to between 1 and 0.5 billion individuals (such a quantity of slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort), create a single universal religion (ecumenism being nothing but the beginning of such a solution) and ultimately acquire absolute power.
The method used by the clan of the richest families with their heads is to create a crisis and then propose a solution (order ab chaos - order according to chaos).
These solutions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the creation of the EDF to prevent the recurrence of crises such as those caused in 1907).
After succeeding in the first world war by the assassination in Sarajevo of Ferdinand, heir to the Austrian-Hungarian throne, they destroyed the Tsarist Russia by provoking the Bolshevik revolution.
The first world war ended abruptly with a German capitulation without economic and military justification (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of the Tsarist Russia) and was followed by the bite of Austria-Hungary, the power of Central Europe.
For an easier start to the second world war, the bankers have allowed politicians to create a latent conflict situation: they have imposed on Germany far-reaching war reparations, thus generating the conditions for radicalization of the impoverished masses (then they are sufficient to place a sufficiently energetic leader, showing the finger of the culprits, proposing simple solutions) and, on the other hand, they created a Czechoslovakia consisting of different nationalities, including a strong German minority that had to play the role (which she actually held) of a fifth column to set fire to the powders and trigger a war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschield inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, one of which aspires to the creation of a Jewish State, preferably in the region of historic Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
Balfour's statement mentioned above laid the foundations for a mass emigration of Jews to Palestine and the first frictions with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist acts were committed on both sides.
The second world war broke out; it is difficult to appreciate whether Hitler broke the chains in which the international bankers had originally held it; or if all he did was planned, however, the fact is that the suffering of the Jews of Europe in the concentration camps created the basis for the acceptance of a Jewish State by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948; in the same way as the war reparations imposed on Germany led to the Second World War, the founding of the State of Israel lit up a firehouse that could lead to a Third World War.
If the international bankers succeed in triggering this war, the Jewish population will be as it was during the Second World War, the first victim of the fighting, this time as well as the Arab or general Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like an immense laboratory, the source of discord and chaos, not only in this country, but internationally (just see how people divide between supporters and defenders of Israel).
Who is guilty and who is the victim of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where one wrong generates another wrong according to a circle of endless violence and where, at the origin of everything, is the greed of some individuals and their desire to gain power over the whole world?
Here we must make the difference between the simple citizens of Israel and their leaders, because, like us, international bankers offer people only their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel is a typical example of a fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, who is doing all he can to wage a war with Iran, who could, because of the country's accession to the Shanghai cooperation organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc.) expand to become a global conflict and, since Iran controls the Ormuz Strait through which it transits 20% of all world oil (this naval corridor is only 2 miles wide) and generates a destruction of the world economy.
In what light is now the words spoken by David Rockefeller in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order."
In their idea, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which a handful of aristocrats of finance are served by the rest of the human population.
A world in which a new born is implanted at birth by an electronic chip making it a totally controlled being.
"May they compel all individuals, small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves to carry on their hands or forehead a mark to the red iron, so that they may neither buy nor sell the one who does not bear the name of this ferocious beast or the number of its name.
It must be understood that he who has good sense counts the numbers of this ferocious beast.
This number means man, and it's six hundred and sixty-six."
The film Argo: when everything goes to hell, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a crowd of protesters made up of Islamic students attacked the American Embassy in Tehran and held 52 diplomats in hostages.
They were to be released in exchange for Shah, Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, who had fled to the United States after the revolution, which had supported his regime for decades.
The situation did not offer the U.S. government a positive outcome, but it could not, in fact, abandon the Shah, because it would have seriously shaken the confidence of its allies in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was unable to obtain the release of hostages.
It was a hard blow for the prestige of the United States, further aggravated by the fiasco of the attempt to free the hostages by force.
The diplomats who were kidnapped were finally released 444 days later, following the negotiations organized by the Algerian government.
Their fate evokes a wave of solidarity and an anti-iranian feeling in the United States.
The Iranian debacle greatly contributed to Jimmy Carter's defeat in front of Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film Argo, by the actor and screenwriter Ben Affleck, describes an episode of this story that offered a small victory in America.
Just before she was occupied, six employees escaped from the embassy.
After complicated events, they found themselves in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to get them out of Iran with a rocambole cover: they left the country with Canadian passports as members of a shooting team who came to make screenings for the shooting of a science fiction film.
Combination of genres
The plan of the exfiltration expert Tony Mendez demands Hollywood's collaboration.
In order to make the legend more credible, specialized stores reported this film project, press conferences were organized and a fictional production company had real offices.
The details of the operation remained secret for a long time, with the film based on Tony Mendez's memories.
Affleck's film is an unusual combination of several genres.
This is on the one hand a political thriller designed in a realistic way but also a "caper movie", the story of a successful blow, a betrayal - for example, in the Ocean's Leven trilogy, twelve and thirteen.
The ambiances follow: sequences of Tehran in documentary style (in the sub-titled sequences are presented iconic photographs of the time of events and the way in which, through these photos, these same situations have been retransscribed in the film, there are no great differences),
the lighter passages of Hollywood, treated with irony and a little exaggeration,
and then scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions with dressed men discussing the situation around conference tables, in the corridors and on the phone...
Ben Affleck managed to restart his career in a remarkable way.
As a ridiculed actor, he became a respected director and his game of actor ceased to raise ironic remarks.
Argo is his third film after the police shadow " Gone Baby Gone" (2007) and the thriller "The City" (2010).
It is also Affleck's first film that does not take place in his home city, Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of a place is one of the characteristics that placed its first films above Hollywood standards.
Affleck also demonstrates this sense of atmosphere in Argo where Tehran's role is "held" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in streets, during the reconstruction of real facts; the initial sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive by its clarity, which also suggests the confusion and unpredictableness that occurs when, in a given place, a page of history is written.
Affleck and his collaborators have a similar effect on fictional scenes (the false shooting team in the Tehran bazaar).
Too many actions at too many locations
The director had to be content with a subject offering only a few exciting scenes, in the cinematographic sense of the term.
It goes well, it sometimes adds some elements to the reality and there, the result is not always as elegant (the scene in which the threat of crisis at the Tehran airport is separated by a phone call in America and the continuation on the landing track is quite drawn by the hair).
The weakness of Argo lies in its dissipated nature, due to the need to show too many events to too many different places.
If it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are quite charming in their role as Hollywood co-opers, their characters would have deserved a bigger place and they are not, far from there, the only ones in this case.
Affleck's film lacks some dramatic tension, it is seen with moderate interest, appreciating the achievements and retro style of the 1970s.
It leads the viewer, but with difficulty.
As a reminder of a story yet, in a way, unfinished to this day, and as an illustration of the exaggerated nature of the representation of secret services as omnipotent and omniscient, he does the matter.
Rules to inflate balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which conducts a public inquiry every year on the most absurd bank charges, has now decided to launch the competition of the regulation or ideas from the most absurd "EU workshop".
"The fact that the EU has been considering adopting a quota of 40 percent of women in the direction of large European companies has been the source of our decision," said the organizer of this survey, Patrik Nacher, for the newspaper Právo.
Among the absurdities mentioned, there is, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify insurance premiums for men and women.
Up to now, however, women were benefiting from life insurance tariffs because they objectively represent a lower risk for insurance companies.
People can report to the end of the year any other such incredible idea of "the EU workshop".
"The vote will take place before the end of February 2013," Nacher said.
The EU's controversial regulations include, for example, the obligation to add bio components to fuels, which has adverse environmental consequences, or the prohibition of using reliable mercury thermometers only because they contain a relatively small amount of a dangerous substance or the chicken cage size directive, which has led to an increase in egg price.
Critics have also been issued in the past against the prohibition of fact of using the term "beurre to tartinate" or the withdrawal of the sale of conventional bulbs.
Quality bananas must have a size of 14 centimeters.
The European administration often reacts under pressure from a commercial or industrial lobby whose applications are usually defended in Brussels by a State or a group of States (now the Czech Republic currently imposes its banks' requests by threatening to use its veto right).
The interests of the pressure groups are also, for example, the fact that bananas in the Union should not be less than 14 cm in size or have "abnormal curvature".
The European Commission defended itself by arguing that it was only harmonising non-homogenous national standards that complicated trade.
The standards for fruit and vegetables have been relaxed despite the opposition of some States, claiming that the existing directives result in food waste.
The first price may be awarded in this survey in the EU regulation last year that there must be a warning on inflatable balloons that children under 8 years of age should not inflate without adult supervision.
The EU referred to an American survey that balloons are among toys the first cause of children's death by suffocation.
A similar restriction applies to children under 14 years of age with regard to blowing in live trumpets.
We have strange ideas, too.
The following rule concerning European officials themselves is quite absurd: because of the sensitivity of this theme to Greece, anyone who has an official role within the EU cannot use the name "Macedoine" and must, instead, speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with the association "Laissez Fare" with liberal economists, the server Bankovnípoplatky.com has appointed, in addition to some of the absurdities mentioned above, the Union Regulation on the volume of food reserves in the Czech Republic.
The EU had set maximum volumes for food reserves that could be found on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the volumes fixed for canned mushrooms and thus risked a heavy fine.
The organizers of this survey found it interesting to pay money to some countries because they do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a subsidy to apply for subsidies.
These ideas, however, are not from Brussels but from Prague.
"The fact that we don't have sea handicaps makes us sick.
We are going to ask the European Union for a refund."In the fall of 2004, the Minister of Agriculture of the time Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) was expressed.
He argued that, because of our wheat production, and as a result of the so-called interventionist purchases, the State had found itself with full stocks that it had then had to export.
According to Palas, the EU should have paid us millions of euros, because the Czech Republic is far from the ports.
Finally, the European Commission responded positively to the Czech demand and organized a call for tenders for wheat from countries without maritime access.
Grants for grants were offered to municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development led by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), which were specifically to be used to draw up applications for grants granted by Brussels.
The EU states that "unusual regulations are rare".
While the regulations are often critical in the Member States, according to many experts, the EU's efforts to regulate and improve the effectiveness of the functioning of the Union as well as in the area of its overall development merit praise.
More serious is, for example, the problem of the use of EU grants for projects which have nothing to do with strengthening European integration, but which have been imposed by Member States during the budgetary negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic, like other EU countries, has to fight in Brussels for the right to use specific names for these traditional products (wrestling of which it does not always succeed) gives rise to strong emotions in the Czechs.
If at the end of six years of battle against the Germans and the Austrians, the Czechs successfully defended the name "Olomucké tvaržky" for the name "Tuzemský rum" which dates back to us in the 19th century, our producers had to replace it with the name "Tuzemák".
Only cane sugar-based products, not beet sugar, may be named rum.
In the official list of products registered in the EU, we find today in the company of cheeses worldwide known as Feta or Gorgonzola, Lübeck's massepain or Parme's ham, Karlovy Vary's biscuits ("Karlovarské suchary"), the carps of Pohořelice and Třeboň ("Pohořelický a Třeboňský kor") and the houblon of Žatec ("Žatecký chmel").
Pardubice's spice bread ("Pardubický perník") and cakes called "Hořice's Cornets" ("hořické trubičky") can also be proud of their community brand.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur, Senator Okamura says
Mr Senator, how is it that we have the idea of presenting ourselves in the presidential elections?
It's not about being a senator or a president that counts for me.
If everything worked smoothly in our country, I would not be a candidate anywhere.
But I can no longer see that the country has been looted for the past twenty years, that thieves are not under locks and taxes and the age of retirement is increasing.
I had no ambition to become a politician.
But when I see something that I don't like, then I'm trying to bring a solution for it to change.
And since I am over forty years old and I am independent, a member of no party, I have no other way of influencing the situation than to present myself to the presidential or Senate elections.
You entered the Senate but you quickly set out for the Castle (N.d.T.: Chair's seat).
Don't you turn your back on those who have chosen you?
I've always said I'm going to fight for the Castle according to the results of the Senate elections.
Later, I explained that if I were elected as a senator, I would present myself to the presidential elections.
My goal is not the function, it is only an instrument that allows me to realize my vision.
That is why I need the greatest influence and the greatest mandate.
The problem is not only as a nation we go to the bar or in front of our TV station, but it is also that we are trapping those who are trying to bring about change.
To this is added the press that breaks the reputation of people and confuses freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
We have, for example, stated in my report that I sweated the journalists or that I was Jiří Paroubek's advisor.
Let's come to your visions.
You have started the fight for the Castle with as a battle horse the themes of the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and retroactive tax returns beyond twenty million [CZK].
You must change the law to that end.
As President, you do not have such power and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When as a citizen, I pressed for tourism guide activities to be a liberal profession, I gained cause gain.
The problem is politics: when someone comes from the left or from the right with a good project, it is deliberately refused and the citizens are delayed.
As an independent member of no party, I have much more chance of getting support from all parliamentary parties.
I have the advantage of being able, without categorization and partisan dogma, to take from each party what is best for our country and implement it.
Do you think of yourself as a man on the right or on the left?
From a Czech point of view, I feel that people are putting me on the left instead.
For me, whether it's a little left or right, it's not really important.
For me, the important thing is that we're going from the front.
What matters to me is not that people are on the left or on the right, but to gather people together.
I always support any solution contributing to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party or the SDO and I also act impartially against bad ideas.
Are you angry when someone says you're a populist?
But what you said doesn't prove it?
When you develop a business plan in a company, you also have an optimal goal and vision.
You're trying to get closer.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I'm talking about have been applied by the world and recognized experts have talked about it.
But without Parliament's support, you have only slogans.
You will not survive long in politics with this.
Do you think if you're going to see people and talk to them, you'll succeed, for example, in imposing physical and criminal responsibility?
I have no other option.
I have to convince politicians, journalists and public opinion and try to rally them to my camp to impose it.
If I were elected president, it would not be a problem of broadcasting live to television, but I ask the presidents of the parliamentary parties to legislate on the material and criminal responsibility of politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
They should then possibly explain why they do not want it.
When there is a strong personality that will identify abuse, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
For example, take the election of the President by direct suffrage, it was obtained through pressure from public opinion.
I confess, without ambages, to be an amateur, not a genius or an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my opinions and visions.
I've just started politics and I'm trying to get the majority support for my program.
I'm trying, alone, to get things moving, and if it doesn't work, I'll stop in six years and go back to the private sector.
It's a bit like Okamura was supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a rescuer.
I know that only one person can't make a difference, so I went to see a number of personalities to ask them to attend the Senate elections as well.
I met Radim Jančura, but he refused because of the amount of work.
I supported at least the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová who revealed the fuel fraud.
I introduced myself because people are really unhappy but now I hesitate.
Sixty percent of the people did not vote and most of them gave their vote to a representative of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independents.
People have elected a Senate that can hardly impose changes.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example the direct election of mayors and prefects of regions.
Are you planning on founding your own party?
No, not yet, because I don't have time to check whether the past of every potential member is spotless and then I don't have the financial means.
I also don't have money for my presidential campaign, I only have twenty thousand on my "transparent" account.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about tax returns, what's yours?
I value about 60 million of my personal property.
I have in Prague a plot worth 25 million, an apartment worth 10 million, another apartment worth 8 million, a collection of artwork worth about 10 million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb worth 1 million and a few million on my account.
I can tell you by the way, I have an Aston Martin, because it was a kid's dream: I always loved James Bond, who was driving, was gallant with women and fighting evil and abuse.
You're driving to Aston Martin, you have a worth of 60 million worth of heritage, and you don't have any money for your campaign?
You want to change the Republic but you don't want to invest your own money there?
It's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for this campaign.
Should I die?
I've already invested two and a half million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsor clearly shows that my program is not of great interest.
I don't have to pay for this campaign from my pocket.
My campaign fees are covered overall by the remuneration I will receive as a senator.
But I couldn't live on it, for example, pay my son's English school that costs 30 thousand a month.
If my only goal was to earn money, I'm not going to stand up for election.
So you're going to continue your business so you can live?
Didn't you say you'd put your activities in a deafening mood?
But this is not related to the amount of this remuneration.
As I promised, I partially reduced my activities.
For example, my deputy will take the direction of the travel agency in spring.
People would like me to be a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I have to live with something.
What was your usual monthly salary when you were an entrepreneur?
I won, and I keep winning between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If I were president, I would end my business.

The architects of the MVRDV cabinet prove that real adventures are not just a matter of imagination. To convince yourself, just look at Spijkenisse and the newly erected mountain of books - 2 photos
"I think this building is funny, it's very futuristic, finally something interesting to see," Lisette Verhaig says, a passerby on the side of the street.
Stefan Spermon, a computerist in a large neighboring company, tells us, "Yes, it's really nice, this building."
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
Everyone has Internet, an iPad and e-books.
Today, no one is going to any more of his free will in one of those ragged libraries, is there?
Spijkenisse, a sleeping town that has nothing to do with the doors of Rotterdam, holds a quite particular record.
The municipality of 80,000 souls shows the lowest rate of education in the Netherlands.
In order to restore some neurons to the brains, the city decided a few years ago to contribute to the general culture and reproduce the seven fictional bridges on the euro banknotes in the form of beautiful small miniatures of painted reinforced concrete.
The success of the cultural offensive remained limited.
This is how the city authorities realized that there was only one way to get back to the statistics: the construction of a library!
Winy Maas, from Rotterdam MVRDV's office of architects, master of bold building diagrams and creator of mind-filled buildings and often cynics, accepted the project with its usual phlegm and attended the competition in 2003 with five books under the arm and a lace on the face.
And while the members of the jury were still looking, disheartening and wrangling the shoulders, Maas, the embroidered, stacked his books of choice in order of size to make it a pyramid, and ended his discourse supported by arguments activists by one: "common goal!"
Here's my proposal for the Spijkenisse mountain of books, or as we say, the Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million-euro mountain has ground.
The building is part of a revitalization project including an underground parking lot, a supermarket, a post office and some buildings and mitoyenne houses for a total of 50 homes.
In early November, the mountain of books received the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project was selected for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
Thus this little burgade terne, which so far had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and a town hall of a harsh lacidour, whose white facades invite to think that they are home to a dairy, has enriched themselves with a contemporary architectural work.
The most important thing is that Spijkenisse now owns the first public cultural building in its history.
The Long Path to Reading
First impression: Eldorado of the book under cheese bell.
True, an elevator carries you to the heart of the massif, but the real joys of reading and architecture open to you when you crowd the floor of the building to discover its topography.
The interior entirely made of glass is bright and clear, the soil in Dutch bricks and the elegant reverbs speak unequivocally the language of municipal public places.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
We are already looking for public banks, dogs and small boys and girls playing at the ball.
And everywhere books, books and even books.
"The library's rays are usually located along the facade and in the middle is a large and dark room, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal," Willy Maas explains.
We have completely upset the classical spatial configuration and opened up the reading spaces from the inside to the outside.
The interior of the mountain of books has been properly adapted: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the centre for the environment and the technical center of the building.
A special beauty lies in the library's black rays, which are sometimes of the lamps, sometimes of the balustrades, sometimes of the staircase ramps.
A new experience for sight, touch and smell.
Even the architects and engineers of the hardened building do not want unknown materials.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," said Joop Trouborst, project leader at the municipality of Spijkenisse, in a response to the Standard.
This is how one day we found an ad hoc waste from agriculture in an agricultural company.
In the Netherlands, the synthetic membrane of a millimetre thick has been used for years as a substrate in greenhouses and fields.
It's cheap and time-consuming.
The final membrane is used for one or two seasons, then it can be discarded.
For the library, the membrane was compressed, for the first time in such quantities, into plates of a thickness of four centimeters.
Under the effect of heat and pressure, the "Landbouwplastic" (KPL) changes color and becomes a dark, homogeneous and resistant material, whose smell evokes both a new car and sports shoes.
At the top of the 105 steps is the top of the mountain.
At the end of almost 500 metres, the literary coffee offers a breathtaking view of the city, as well as Dutch croquettes and ficus pots.
They create an atmosphere, but they mainly contribute to the maintenance of the ideal level of moisture in the air of the literary mountain.
Gifts for the New Soul
"It's incredible, but despite all the glass surfaces, this building is a model project on ecology," Trouborst says.
The temperature of the building is adjusted by geothermal.
Although the mountain of books is below a glass bell, the sun illuminates only little time inside, even the days of good weather.
The thick beams of wood mounted across the glass facade serve as a sunscreen, intercepting a large part of the rays.
The atmosphere is very pleasant.
The fully automated blinds take care of the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the above-mentioned septic computer scientist, has already been at risk of entering the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
Cynthia Bogarde, professor of traditional Chinese medicine, describes even Boekenberg as "the finally found soul" of Spijkenisse.
A few weeks ago, at the inauguration, every citizen was invited to donate a book from his personal library.
This measure has helped to fill the library's gaps that were not yet fully garnished (today, it has 70,000 books).
The concept is a success.
The rays overflow everywhere.
For architect Winy Maas, "there's nothing worse than a half-empty library."
"I believe our invitation has created a certain relationship between every citizen and this new building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's just for decoration."
This is how MVRDV has reached the master discipline called, in the professional jargon, "the creation of an identity".
Spijkenisse wrote a new history page.
Even if she may appear young and uneducated.
Finally, this is a new starting point for the birth of an identity.
Szabo: "The Germans must play a greater role."
Germany chose to abstain when voting on the admission of the Palestinian State.
According to Stephen Szabo, expert on relations between the United States and the EU, this decision puts Berlin in a delicate political situation.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had announced its intention to vote against the Palestinian demand for observer status with the United Nations.
But then she chose abstention.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not approve of what Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, Berlin must be cautious as it maintains special relations with Israel.
But I also think that she does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to assert its independence without, however, being too critical of Israel.
During the insurrection in Libya in March 2011, Germany also chose to abstain when voting on the establishment of an air exclusion zone.
Finally, NATO imposed this measure.
Does Germany have any difficulty in adopting a clear position on major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason for this is that Berlin is reviewing its foreign policy, seeking to move away from a policy, so to speak, defined by the Americans and to establish a German foreign policy.
Moreover, the lack of a coherent and common policy within the Union complicates the situation.
The Germans are therefore facing several fronts.
We expect them to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still trying to find this role, but they are on the way to a "more normal" foreign policy.
External policy, such as in France or Great Britain
What, then, does the term "normal" foreign policy really mean for Germans?
It shows the willingness to adopt positions independent of those of the United States and European partners, including with regard to national dossiers.
I believe that German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, therefore by exports and relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Near East.
German economic interests are, to some extent, different from those of the other great powers: that is why Germany has to protect its interests.
Did these economic interests influence the position of Germany with regard to the conflict in the Near East and the abstention in the United Nations vote?
Germany has first important opportunities in the Near East, especially in the Gulf countries.
That is why Berlin must be careful not to undermine public opinion, but also the elites of the Arab countries.
This is undoubtedly a decisive element.
However, I would not give too much importance to this because it is not purely unilateral.
But this is in any case a key element in German strategic reflections.
Does Germany harm its relations with the United States by choosing abstention during major votes, as in the case of Palestine?
I think that Europeans and Americans fully understand the German position.
That is why I think the fracture is not so serious that it was in the case of the Libyan question.
Perhaps even Germany will only be respected.
Germany has thus shown that it must be taken seriously as an international actor and that its interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, views on the Palestinian initiative vary.
On the other hand, the United States has announced its veto with a clear voice.
Do the views differ between the United States and the majority of European countries?
There have always been differences because of the American domestic political scene.
I believe that the Obama Administration secretly shows great understanding of the European position.
But given the political configuration of the country, the government cannot, of course, defend its position publicly.
I believe that the real differences of opinion are not so great that they always seem.
If you observe the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahou, you will notice that Obama is far from overwhelmed with enthusiasm about Netanyahou's policy.
Does Germany find it difficult to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of the major European partners, on the other hand?
I don't think it's easy for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a coherent and uniform European policy, but today that is not the case.
They cannot therefore enter a broader political line and must affirm their unique position.
This is what they are currently doing in the euro issue.
In my opinion, Germany will take a locomotive role in the future and push Europe to adopt a European position.
It is not simple for Germany, especially because of relations with Israel.
This issue has always been sensitive.
But in my view, the Germans are well aware that they must play a role that further marks their independence.
Does Germany see itself playing a major role on the international stage, and does Germany only want to play a key role?
Or is it still difficult to assume leading roles?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still uncomfortable to it and, for obvious reasons, the country still faces difficulties in playing a more important role.
Looking, for example, at the euro crisis, it is noted that every time Germany decides to weigh more, many anti-German feelings are heard.
It doesn't make things easier for the Germans.
In fact, it is still the same problem: we do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more delicate position than the United States.
It must be composed of neighbors and very varied opinions, and it is not easy.
Today, the United States' influence on European policy only diminishes, but at the moment, the EU does not fill this gap, so who remains?
The Germans will simply have to play a more important role.
And even if they don't like it, even if it's unpleasant to them and if they're only less appreciated, it's life!

"Protection of Brands" in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are known brands around the world.
Armani Polo... what is this really about?
Behind that name is a trademark officially registered in China, but it has nothing to do with the original company.
The trade mark thus enjoys protection such that the company bearing its name cannot lodge a complaint.
And even if she could, he's not sure she'd get a cause for it.
"It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China," said Thomas Pattloch, lawyer at Taylor Wessing's firm, who specializes in violating the property law in the Far East.
Every week, a new file arrives on my desk.
Imitators only need a few extra letters to be able to record their marks.
So, instead of Gucci, we register Lu-Gucci, and instead of Prada, we register Prada-Kny.
German companies have also been legally copied, such as Puma, the manufacturer of sports products.
Pattloch opens a classifier in which records are made at the Beijing Trademark Office.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company filed the brand Zegna DF Puma, a name that the firm artificially created by appropriateing part of the name Ermenegildo Zegna, the fashion house.
It is a known fact that the Chinese have become champions of the world of copying and violating intellectual property.
In large cities, there are several-storey malls that sell practically counterfeits.
However, Pattloch's cases are different: its commanders charge it to attack the fact that the Chinese trade marks office officially confers on Chinese companies the right to use a name that is already protected in another country.
The Chinese speak of "Bang Mingpai" as a parent.
The term is derived from "Bang Dakuan".
It is with this term that women who marry rich men are designated.
The Chinese authorities say they have nothing to complain about.
"It's bad for business, we have to fight this trend," Pattloch demands.
"The brand is sweetened, the singularity disappears, the damage to reputation is enormous."
Financial losses and costs of justice are estimated at millions for the sectors concerned, especially in the case of expensive flagship products.
According to the CLSA market analysis company data, China represents, with an annual volume of €15 billion, the third world market for luxury products and the one that is growing as fast as possible.
However, it is not easy to remove the questionable registrations of the trademark register and these procedures are expensive.
The latter can last for up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain.
Pattloch reports the trials in which the court rejected the complaint, because after a long period of time, the contested name had become a "market reality".
Pattloch explains to us that if the complainant is not lucky, he may even be obliged to pay money to the plagiarism because he would have harmed his brand in China.
In this area, sometimes the law of the jungle dominates.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler had lost a legal battle against the construction machine builder Sany, the same company that had just purchased the manufacturer of putzmeister concrete pumps.
That's why the Chinese can use an emblem that looks like the Mercedes star.
Geely, Volvo's buyer, used a blue and white logo that reminded BMW's logo. The conflict was settled and Geely had to change it.
The Lacoste fashion house had lost against the plagiarists of Hong Kong and Singapore who had redirected the gaze of the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
According to the Chinese authorities, they are not guilty of anything.
However, the CTMO Trademarks Office in Beijing admitted some difficulties in 2010 due to a lack of staff and space.
However, the Office would have moved last year from an "emergency situation in the course of work to a normality found".
Thus, the number of untreated opposition procedures would have decreased by 22%.
Almost 57,000 such cases would have been closed, representing an increase of 75% compared to the previous year.
However, 81,500 procedures remain in the office.
Carrying Cost
As often as in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for trade mark filing, almost one third more than in 2010.
According to the Office, this is a record and this means that China is at the top of the ranking for the number of new deposits in the world for the tenth consecutive time.
This would also apply to the total number of legal marks, which is 5.5 million.
In 2011, the Office reportedly accounted for 1.8 billion yuan of registration rights.
In other words, each record reported on average 1,280 yuan, or 160 euros.
A legal battle costs much more, as illustrated by the case of the German family company Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the company has fought against a Chinese plagiarism.
Of course, the Germans were able to obtain the illegal manufacture of vehicle components suspended.
However, the Imitator was able to maintain his Chinese rights on the Freudenberg brand.
"It's our fault, because family names cannot be protected in Germany," said Hanno Wentzler, president of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The Trademark Office had therefore rejected the Munich objection.
Freudenberg has, of course, obtained a profit of cause from the following two instances, but the opposing party continues to fight until today.
Vigilance Is Out
Today, the case is pending with the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident, believes in a positive outcome of the trial and vanquishs the professionalism of the judges.
Nevertheless, he adds: "The procedure is long, difficult and costs us a lot of time and money."
It is also difficult to assess internal costs. The archive service has even had to review the actions of the past 100 years in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg even offered in vain to the opposing party a "great sum of EUR six digits" to settle the dispute.
"That's what we see what this represents for us," said Wentzler.
The dangers of the Far East even threaten to overflow to Europe.
That would be the case if copyists in this area were to make sure that the unprotected trademarks were operated.
For example, a Chinese producer wanted to name Freudenberg in Germany for a shoe and leather production company.
The company had long abandoned this sector, but had still been able to prevent depositing.
Wentzler adds: "the vigilance is put."
Pattloch and advise the German companies to exercise great caution in their commercial relations with China.
It is not enough, they believe, to rely on international trade marks law, that foreigners should rather "register also in China all that is likely to be protected", as Wentzler says.
If not, costs may be much more important than registration costs.
In fact, if Freudenberg lost the battle in the last act of its legal drama, the company should pay license rights to the opposing party for the use of its own name, as Wentzler explains.
Or we would lose our place on the market segment in question.
World AIDS Day: Foot Taping, Singing, Helping
The Imbongi choir repeats at Heidelberg, and the AIDS orphans of Swaziland rejoice at their arrival.
Here is the story of a link that goes far beyond a distance of 8,733 kilometers.
First, we hit the foot: cowboy boots, basketball boots, scarves for ladies and moccasins for men seek rhythm by hitting the ground of the foot. Very quickly, they find it.
One, two, three, four.
Then, the voices of the singers slowly amplify - high, low, tenor and soprano -, they take hold, stir and follow.
Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor loses almost his canvas shoes when he directs the orchestra with his gestures of a wild flexibility.
We are Monday evening, the Choral Imbongi repeats a new song in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg.
Fifty singers and singers from 23 to 69 years of age came, from the genetician in human medicine to the man at home.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each Chorist has different words, all in a very exotic language: zulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and certain regions of Swaziland.
Be Helped to Help
UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS Programme, estimates that 34 million people worldwide are affected by the disease.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 infected persons.
In addition, more than 40 per cent of the population is HIV-positive.
180 AIDS orphans from the village of Esitjeni have found sponsors in Germany thanks to the association "Voices for Africa".
70 of them attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros per second, one can become a sponsor.
This amount guarantees the child money for the school, a school uniform and a daily hot meal in the gogo center.
Imbongi means in zulu "counter of stories" or even "songer of praises".
No one can usually speak Bantou language in this region, but everyone can sing it.
For nearly 10 years, the choir has been repeating songs in this foreign language that it has brought to Germany to its birthplace: South Africa.
For 8,733 kilometers by flight of Heidelberg bird, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is Esitjeni, the village that depends on the vocal power of the German choral.
40% of people affected
The village has about 2,000 inhabitants, some of whom live in modest straw huts or land, and most of them are children.
More than 300 of them are orphans, as HIV has taken their parents.
In Estjeni, there is a smaller-scale observation of Swaziland's ills: the highest rate of HIV infection and the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
The population never nearly accepts male circumcision, a measure that nevertheless guarantees a proven reduction in the risk of infection by half.
More than 40% of the population of Swaziland is infected with the immunodeficiency virus and it is not uncommon to die in the mid-30s.
During a group trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choral had been able to discover the village. The Imbongis mainly saw many children on the street to whom not only lack parental care, but also simply everything: food, clothing, education.
In a poor country, without a school degree, there is absolutely no prospect.
At first, there were only a few people who were personally committed to paying a few euros each year in order to be able to send a child to school and to offer him a warm meal every day.
But just a year later, the choral founded "Voices for Africa", an association that has been almost professionally dealing with AIDS orphans in Esitjeni since then.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most common sexually transmitted diseases?
These bacteria include syphilis, chlamydia, and blannorrhage (or gonorrhoea).
Current STIs are HIV, human papilloma virus, genital herpes, or hepatitis.
Pubis thumbs and galley belong to parasitic IST.
What are the main groups involved?
Syphilis and blannorrhage often appear in men who have sex with other men.
The Robert-Koch Institute estimates that sexual contact between men is the cause of at least four cases of syphilis out of five reported in Germany.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia-related infections, trichomonase, candidiasis (fungic), palenorrhage and human papilloma virus are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The rate of spread of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany. However, some 20% of new HIV infections are observed in this group.
In young people, there is a significantly higher rate of chlamydia-related infections than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections concern young people aged 15-25.
In addition, in Germany, the human papilloma virus is common among young people.
What is the evolution of the number of infections?
It is not mandatory to report all sexually transmitted diseases.
According to the Robert-Koch Institute, the number of cases of syphilis has more than doubled in 10 years: the number has increased from 1,967 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections has decreased.
In 2011, there were approximately 2,700 cases.
This represents a decrease of one tenth compared to the previous year.
What are the symptoms of a sexual illness?
Infectious diseases can cause abscesses at the level of genital organs, urinary pain, white loss, low ventilating pain, and the appearance of buttons and warts.
However, they do not cause any pain or other symptoms on a regular basis and therefore remain hidden.
How can you protect yourself?
Preservatives may reduce the risk of infection, but do not protect 100%.
The reason is that pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through lubricant infection or close body contact.
The experts therefore recommend that anyone who often changes sex partners regularly pass examinations.
Most rapidly exposed ISTs can be cured and late sequels can be avoided.
Thanks to sponsorships, donations, but above all to funds collected by the Chorists through their voices throughout Germany, the means accumulate.
"In all, we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," said Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a woman who is sure of herself and who always gets what she wants, manages money from Germany.
It also ensures that orphans are well-connected, for example, with one of their grandmothers.
The gogos, that's what we call the old women in zulu, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them host up to 14 orphans, offer them a roof and make sure they go to school every day in their uniforms.
The orphan who no longer has anyone is accommodated in a safe place, at Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, as well as the two cooks who prepare daily meals for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" created a sewing school and allowed the construction of two chickens. With the help of the US Health Organization PSI, the association organized an HIV testing test for many people.
This is not for itself, because even though the disease is clearly visible throughout the country, it remains a taboo subject.
A king and his 14 wives
"AIDS is a real taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it's a topic that touches sexuality."
It's pretty curious, coming from a country whose king has 14 official wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
These deaths sanctioned by the State, among other things, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV in recent decades.
Migrant workers have also spread the virus across the country.
Yet we find condoms at every corner of the street, add Annette Lennartz, "but almost no one uses them.
Culture is different, flesh against flesh."
In order to promote cultural exchange, Imbongi chorists travel together every two to three years in South Africa and sound songs filled with nostalgia, courage, trust and black identity that many of the residents of the Black continent's peak still know about apartheid.
The bus full of whites singing in the African language is a sign of recognition as it generates not only good mood and joy, but sometimes also tears to some redoubious border guards.
The bus always takes them to Esitjeni, where the choreists visit their daughters.
Even though it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esitjeni is well known in the Ezulweni Valley.
"Go to Esitjeni, you'll find some light," people say there.
And after a journey of 8,733 kilometers by bird flight, back to Heidelberg, in front of these choristers who walk from the foot in the rehearsal room of the Bergheimer Straße, we also find the light.
Messenger: NASA Discovers Ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe reported evidence of the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice layer could reach 20 meters thick.
The American Space Agency NASA has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although this planet is the closest to the Sun, it contains frozen water, as explained by three studies published on Thursday in the specialized journal "Science".
The Messenger probe reported evidence of the existence of ice cover in the region of the planet permanently plunged into the shadow.
This cover would have a thickness of at least 30 centimeters up to 20 meters.
The water probably comes from comets or maybe asteroids that would have hit Mercury.
However, no one connects the discovery of water with the hypothesis of a presence of life on the planet, explains the head scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
The discovery could help understand how water and other life-critical elements have arrived in other regions of the solar system.
Unprecedented by the inhabitants of our planet, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to earth, such as small interstices through which we observe infinity.
The image comes from a photographic camera developed by German researchers at the Max-Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the Nain Planet Cerès.
As Pluton, orbiting the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not considered a "planet", according to the new definition of the term of the International Astronomical Union of 2006.
This detail of an infrared photograph taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are blue and the pink points, the most difficult to identify, are the "new-born" in the universe's delivery room.
The Spitzer telescope discovered this region where the stars were born, called "W5", a very romantic name, in the constellation of Cassiopas, at 6,500 light-years.
NASA's Spitzer telescope photographed the flashing flash of a dying star.
The beignet-shaped circle is composed of elements that the star projects when it dies.
In the immense trifide nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, gas and dust form new stars.
The Spitzer telescope photographed this galactic delivery room.
The Pleiades, a host of stars also called "the seven sisters", can be observed in the naked eye during the night.
However, the telescope enhances the colors.
On this infrared photo, Helice's nebula, like a red eye, looks directly at the viewer.
It is 700 light-years away in the Constellation of the Verseau.
Its similarities with an Earth continent have earned him the title of North America.
The combination of normal photo and infrared photo allows you to observe a spectacular hue.
Only the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope were able to capture an image of the new star in all its beauty.
One of the greatest enigmas of astronomy relates to the creation of Saturn's rings.
One theory is that rings are the remains of a moon of Saturn that disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without leaving traces.
One of the largest and sharpest photographs taken by the Hubble telescope is that of the Tourbillon galaxy.
According to the hue, photographs of spiral galaxies can become real works of art.
The photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the nebulae of the Trifide in the constellation of Sagittarius, several thousand light years ago.
Trifide's name comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided, divided into three), because three dust drags divide the heart of the star's birthplace.
Astronomers photographed the first of a cosmic carabolage in the Constellation of the Serpentaire: 400 million light-years from Earth, the cores of two fusion galaxies rush each other, the collision is inevitable.
The Hubble telescope observed the birth of these stars in the M83 spiral galaxy.
If you don't like the technical abbreviations, you can use its nickname "austral firewheel".
The photograph of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a detail of the Iris Nebula, in the constellation of Cephea.
The nebula is 1,400 light-years and consists of dust grains that are ten to a hundred times smaller than the current domestic dust.
This photo was prepared from optical and radiographic photos taken by different telescopes.
We can see the circle of black holes that is 430 million light-years from Earth.
The space telescope photographed for NASA this group of galaxies named Arp 273.
Scientists have called the largest spiral galaxy "GC 1810".
In this nebula is the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The heavenly cradle always gives birth to new stars.
These star clouds, which are connected by the Rosette nebula, also continuously create young stars at 5,000 Earth's light years.
In this light-radiated galaxy with a small black hole, there is still no dust, there is only gas.
Scientists believe that it was born shortly after the bigbang, when the universe was composed largely of hydrogen.
Our Look at the Universe: The Main Telescopes
The telescope would have been invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before Galilee used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have never ceased to grow, and thanks to them, it has been possible to see more and more in the universe.
For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Mountain Observatory near San Diego was the world's largest telescope.
The mirror on this image had a diameter of five meters.
The Large Binocular Telescope is located in Arizona, U.S.A.
It allows you to observe the universe through two mirrors each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The belly of the Gran Telescopio Canarias in La Palma, the Canary Islands is immense. The mirror itself reaches a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The Southern African Large Telescope mirror in South Africa has been segmented for savings.
The diameter is approximately 11 metres.
The drawback of the method of economic construction is that the telescope is fixed at the vertical angle level, which limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also set at the vertical angle.
Its uniqueness is due to its great capacity to collect light.
Despite a relatively small mirror diameter, this capacity is closer to those of the world's largest mirror telescopes.
Scientists are listening to the universe for extra-terrestrial signals using Arecibo's (Puerto Rico) radio telescope.
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Any person who owns a computer can help the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI, or "extraterrestrial intelligence search") by contributing the power to calculate its machine.
View on the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope ("very large telescope"), an installation worthy of its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can illuminate the average infrared spectrum.
The construction of a very large European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned for the ESO site in Chile.
Its main mirror should reach the impressive size of 42 meters. It will be composed of nearly 1,000 mirrors.
However, the telescope will not be able to take clicks before 2018 at the earliest.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They bore two mirrors of a diameter of 10 meters each.
Keck's telescopes are part of Mauna Kea's observatory that watches the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTF.
A giant new telescope should also be built on Mauna Kea and the diameter of its mirror will reach 30 meters.
This illustration allows you to admire it.
However, the most important images of space come from Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has given us images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope has been looking for exoplanets, mainly those that are habitable.
NASA announced on February 2, 2011 that it had found 1,235 candidate planets since the beginning of the mission.
This photo illustrates the latest preparations before the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The James-Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent in space as early as 2018 on board an Ariane 5 rocket.
The first mirror of the infrared space telescope is 6.5 metres in diameter.
In particular, the telescope will have the mission to find light projected by the first stars and galaxies after the bigbang.
Scientists believe that the southern pole of Mercury is also home to ice.
However, no reliable data on this theory exists, as Messenger orbits much closer to the North Pole of Mercury.
Radar data for decades indicated the presence of ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the launch of the Messenger probe in 2004, the first to orbit around Mercury, scientists are now certain of it.
Drink butter daily, and live up to 168 years
In South Azerbaijan, many people reach the ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There's even a museum of longevity.
A country survey, in which we are still relatively young at 97 years of age.
In South Azerbaijan, many people reach the ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There's even a museum of longevity.
A country survey, in which we are still relatively young at 97 years of age.
The trip to the Talysh Mountains is of a broken romanticism.
Behind the many rounds of the road, the small bus falls along forested hills, torrential rivers and modest farms.
Everything is green and fertile, almost believed in the Black Forest.
But we are here in the south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
This is where the Caucasian ethnic group of the name of Talysh, about which we don't know much, is that they speak the Persian and Azeri perfectly and that they have a very long life.
Terminus: Lerik.
The small town platronne with its too aggressive architecture of the Soviet era that does not entirely match the picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists are rare here, the journey from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is too painful.
It takes eight hours to travel the 323 kilometres, because the road has only one road.
The province has not yet taken advantage of the legendary wealth that the country owes to its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.
However, Pilate Fatulayeva, 48 years old, is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist spot.
"Baku became famous in May thanks to the Eurovision competition, and next year there will be the festival of the oldest people in the world," Fatulayeva explains.
She is the director of the longevity museum, the only such museum in the world.
There you can discover the life of about eight dozen Talysh in the region who are over 100 years old. Fatulayeva shows us a black and white photo.
Here's my grandfather, he's 120 years old.
There is still one child at 136 years of age
But the controversial star of the museum is Şirali Müslümov, a shepherd who would have been 168 years old.
However, there is no act of birth.
And when we think that the oldest person documented was 122 years old, Müslümov's age seems more than doubtful.
"He was born in 1805, he died in 1973," Fatulayeva said.
The man would have married three times and he would have had 23 children. At the age of 136, he would still have conceived a girl.
Would Şirali Müslümov have been mistaken for a few decades by calculating his age?
Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max-Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard him talk about man at the age of Central Asia.
"Egtonly elderly people also live in certain areas of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "also in Sardinia, there are men who live incredibly old."
However, it is impossible to establish scientific evidence due to the absence of documents, not to mention that there was no record of marital status.
Every day, one glass of melted butter
However, it is true that people in the Lerik area often reach a age worthy of the Bible’s patriarchs.
Currently, 20 people are over 100 years old.
What, then, is the reason for the longevity in the South of this country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, the Azeri tourist guide, explains that the Talysh have particular genes.
On the other hand, Fatulayeva, the museum's director, thinks it's a food issue.
However, it does not seem plausible, from a nutritional point of view, that Talysh calorie-rich meals, which love meat, bread and especially dairy products, and many of which drink daily a glass of melted butter, are good for health.
Or is this the simple way of life that preserves people's youth? In Cengemiran, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva lives.
At age 97, she is still relatively young for the region.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest wooden house, as it is typical to see throughout the Caucasus region.
It is sitting on the ground next to a corner, whose contents it untiringly beats.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and a long-old girl.
Two small children are also at home.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests served in typical belly-shaped armed glasses.
Mirzayeva's white teeth are perfectly aligned, and under his scarf they hide themselves with long strips of a dark blonde that his son reveals with pride.
I've always washed my hair with milk, and that's how I've never lost them and they've kept their color.
"I've never used shampoo," adds Mirzayeva.
Monthly retirement is enough to live
She has always eaten what comes from her own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and small peas.
All my life, I've never bought the least food in a supermarket.
Then she tells us about her husband who was in the army.
The worst times were after World War II.
But everything got better when the "Beloved Father" Heydar Aliyev took orders.
The language of propaganda is amazing in the mouth of an old lady.
However, the worship of the paternal figure of the nation, a man who still ruled his country as a dictator, knew almost no limits in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, his son Ilham succeeded him later.
Whatever the case, the elderly in Azerbaijan are not in distress.
Mirzayeva receives every month 230 manats (about the same amount as in euros) for its retirement, a sum that guarantees a good life in the region.
And perhaps the long-standing son of Mirzayeva is right: "The elders enjoy great respect in our culture".
They are the center of the big family, they are loved, cared for and happy.
That is a good reason to live as long as possible.
The "rights of man" omitted in the Constitution
The revolution was reborn in Cairo.
Rival manifestations reveal the country's deep fracture.
The draft constitution based on the sharia is violently controversial.
The President of Egypt is not bored with words filled with emotions.
We must succeed in the transition.
"And this success is my responsibility to the people and to God," he said to state television.
His speech was intended for the whole people, but also for the Christian Coptics, liberals, enlightened Muslims and seculars.
For all the members of the confused and hopelessly disunited opposition are afraid.
They fear a theocracy on the Nile at the hands of the powerful Muslim Brothers.
Mohamed Morsi said, almost apologizing, that he temporarily restricted the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded his "in order to save the revolution".
However, the Egyptians and the world do not really know what this 61-year-old engineer, a doctorate in the U.S. University of Southern California, wants to save.
Will the judiciary be overthrown?
The 234 articles drawn up in haste by the predominantly Islamic assembly of 100 people during a five-hour night force tour are indeed worrying to some extent.
As in previous constitutions, the draft provides that jurisprudence is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what does the word "princes" really mean?
This was and still remains a question of interpretation, and there are good reasons to fear that Islamists will use the vague formulation and legal margin of manoeuvre resulting from it to apply a stricter interpretation of the sharia.
In any case, it suggests a newly introduced article stipulating that, with regard to all subjects related to the sharia, the al-Azhar university should be consulted. The institution is the most important Islamic institution in the country and its spark radiates across the Sunni Islamic world.
This may, but it does not necessarily mean that the clergy will monitor the legislative system, which would in fact result in the supervision of the judiciary.
Many points in the draft Constitution are for interpretation
Another problematic aspect is the probable maintenance of military jurisdiction.
During the reign of Moubarak, these courts were trying to suppress the opponents.
After the dictator's fall, up to 11,000 civilians were detained by the military.
The State must also, in the project, protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "promote its morals and values".
From a legal point of view, the formulation is so vague that state institutions could even control the content of cinematography and literature.
Clearly, this would simply be censorship.
Furthermore, no article specifically guarantees equality between men and women.
Instead, another article forbids the offending or defaming of Prophet Muhammad or his envoys.
However, the article does not define what an offence is or how it should be punished.
Equally doubtful is the wording that makes it clear that it is forbidden to "offend people".
Is it enough to draw a cartoon from the president or tell a joke to the detriment of a man of law?
Many points are therefore matters for interpretation in the project that Morsi is voting and that, in his own words, will make a referendum with the Egyptians "very soon".
"The Revolution Renewed"
The opposition has been mobilizing for weeks against the digital superiority of Islamists.
On Friday evening, tens of thousands of protesters gathered in an unusual concord on Tahrir Square in Cairo, promising to bring down the charia before it enters into force.
"The revolution is reborn and we are going to win," launches Hamdin Sabbahi, who arrived third in the presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace Prize and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El Baradei said that the draft Constitution is "to throw into the dusts of history".
On Twitter, the instant messaging service, he accused Morsi’s supporters of wanting to foster a “putsch against democracy”.
"If he proclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and we will overthrow him," said Jasser Said, an opponent.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet at risk," said Egyptian mediaman Khaled Ali, a political man and a member of the opposition.
In addition, several judges have announced that they do not want to monitor the referendum, which would lead to its nullity.
"The Qur'an is our Constitution"
For its part, the well-organized Muslim confrererie called for a counter-manifestation not on Tahrir Square as a precaution, but on the other side of the Nile, where a great prayer was organized before the University of Cairo.
The veiled women and supporters of the Salafists, who participated in it in a large number, were outraged: "the people demand the application of the law of God."
"Clean our country!" they asked Morsi, asserting that "the Qur'an [was their] Constitution."
A struggle for sovereignty on the symbolic Tharir Square, where everything began, would soon have generated a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Clearly, this is what Morsi's supporters wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Brotherhood stated that opponents of the draft Constitution, in the same way as its supporters, had expressed themselves high and strong.
According to them, it is now time to let the people decide by the management polls that the country should take.
The Islamist project will certainly win the majority.
"Human rights are not mentioned once"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry at this constitutional process imposed that should have lasted until February and encompass all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and President of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) had defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or before the courts under Mubarak.
He did not do so because he shared their world view, but because human rights are indivisible for him.
That's why he was beaten, tried and imprisoned.
"And now, the term is not even pronounced once in the new Constitution," he regrets during his interview with the Welt am Sonntag.
The extension of Morsi's powers to the three powers discouraged the lawyer.
These measures are serious infringements of the rules of democracy and will create a new dictatorship in Egypt.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the President de facto withdraws all his powers," says Saeda.
However, democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels abandoned, including by the international community, who looks at the battle between different political ideologies on the edge of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.
This could be paid.
A protester at Tharir's place warns: "you're giving birth to a monster that you'll no longer be able to control."
Norway's Rakfisk: Is it the most smelly fish in the world?
The five million people who live in Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe, but also in the world.
Could the secret of the country's success be linked to the appetite of the premises for an extremely smelly fish?
Take advanced cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of wet and salt football clothing.
Wait a week.
And you get the disturbing smell of the rakfisk, one of Norway's most prized dishes.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about 3 hours from Oslo.
The snow, the landscape is spectacular - and this smell, omnipresent, imprints the air.
The rakfisk consists of salt-salted and fermented trout in the water for a period - depending on the smell you want it to exhale - which can go up to a year.
When the darkness settles and is cold, the Norwegians gather in mass to attend a festival that takes place here in Fagernes, dedicated to this incredible culinary speciality.
"You eat raw, then swallow a glass of aquavit," explains Harvard Halvarsen, a full-time local firefighter also known as "Rakfisk General", responsible for managing the festival.
Around us, people swallow small pieces of fish and grow a lot of drink.
"Some people prefer aquavit to rakfisk," Havard adds.
Drink kills the smell.
I'm trying a few pieces.
If you can avoid getting it under your nose, it's not bad - it makes you think of a sushi who would have spent long hours on a bus.
The rakfisk dates back to a time when Norway was poor, before the invention of the refrigeration, the fish was immersed in waterproof water barrels in the air, then salted in the fall.
Then, in the winter, once well fermented, the fish came out and - no doubt with the senses diminished by alcohol - eaten.
At the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country to find work, mainly emigrating to the United States.
Now, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by full employment, high wages and a comprehensive health system.
The Swedish people, their old rivals whose country was not so much richer than Norway, cross the border to come to work.
Rakfisk is considered to be something important, a vital, though odorant, element of Norway's past.
This is part of the most expensive dishes.
But everything is expensive - a little beer pin or a sandwich will cost you 10 € each.
Norway does not often talk about it in international news, which is not to displease it.
Here, people are not willing to talk about Anders Breivik, the right-wing extremist racist who killed 77 people, including women and children.
When they mention this murder, they talk about the "July 22 incident".
The Norwegians find it difficult to accept that in their peaceful country, one of them could commit such an act of barbarism.
Since the early 1970s, Norway owes its wealth to its oil and gas industry, one of the most important in the world.
"But oil is not the only reason why we are successful," explains Anna, our waitress, to the blonde hair and to the eyes of a transverse blue, the image of Nordic well-being, with a hand-held rackfisk tray.
We are - as you say - prudent people.
His English, like that of most people who live here, is perfect.
We are discreet, we do not like to be noticed.
Norway managed its oil wealth with great caution - all with the exception of a small percentage of money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When other countries threw money through the windows, in the years that led us to the international financial crisis, Norway was able to keep the cords of its stock market tight.
"As long as we can ski in winter and do hiking in summer, we're happy," says Anna.
"Without forgetting the rakfisk," she added in an unnerving laugh.
I'm standing under the snow and I'm tailing to buy what to eat - I had my dose of rakfisk.
On the menu, a burger composed of momentum, a true discovery, is excellent.
But tonight, the smell of fish is everywhere.
The hotel I live in is one of many places where rakfisk is used for dinner and where one can vote for the best of them - or perhaps for the most smelling of them.
There is a TV show where the presenter wears a paper knot, surrounded by rakfisk plates.
We would believe in the Eurovision competition.
"What score did you give to the best fish in the Thor-Juergen Mountains?"
"Here's the points, Harvard."
We hear laughter and applause.
A man falls from his chair, perhaps because of the abuse of aquavit.
Or maybe it's because of fish sprouts.
Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto has a difficult start.
While the incoming President Enrique Pena Nieto is preparing to take office in Mexico, Will Grant, of the BBC, is interested in the challenges ahead and in the expectations of the people, who are numerous.
Road traffic in Mexico is particularly bad at the moment.
In a city where traffic jams are legion in normal time, a security dam has been set up since Monday, blocking several key road access in the capital and causing real chaos on the roads.
However, the objective was not to prevent people from going to work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
Next Saturday, the new President of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential scar to become the new President at the head of the nation.
A complicated task awaits him.
Mexico's economy is good, results that are owed to the outgoing president Felipe Calderon, but the country is in the midst of a drug war that has already cost about 60,000 people their lives in six years.
"My government has made a commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," said Pena Nieto to U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before joining the US president, Mr. Pena Nieto was governor of the state of Mexico.
A very populous and tempting state that places the capital. On its land of predilection, the views of this new leader are divided.
A direct man
In the bucolic municipality of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is inscribed in the memory of all.
The premises give it the development of tourism and infrastructure in the municipality.
To reach the city, you can take one of the new highways of M Pena Nieto, an important improvement has been made to these roads, once bosselated and full of prawns.
Plates with its name are attached outside a new sport complex and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
"We count on him to put in place lasting changes," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of the congress and party of Mr. Pena Nieto, the PRI.
In terms of security and economy, among other things, we hope for a real change that our country so needs.
After 81 years without failure in power, the PRI was issued in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
The Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the Presidential Palace of Los Pinos, there are many expectations within the party concerning Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejected the criticisms of the opponents who criticized the new president for lack of charism.
He is an entire, very committed man, with an excellent view of the country.
He's an excellent stateman and, above all, he can listen.
However, it is not always the image that the people of their former governor have.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more flagrant.
Hidden under the highways, it is, in many respects, a suburb of Mexico City.
And the problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban.
Earlier in the year, the military was called upon to rescue the drug gangs in the neighbourhoods, and violence against women was particularly serious.
In a disaster zone, the bodies of dozens of women murdered in the last two years have been found on a landfill border.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Pena Nieto was governor, a much higher rate than in the very violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place sadly famous for the number of innocent women who were killed there.
Mr. Pena Nieto's detractors say that he was at best unable to tackle the problem of killing women when they were in office.
At worst, they accuse their administration of refusing to see reality in front of them.
In a concrete house, typical of this neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles to hold back her tears when she shows me pictures of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
The official version reported a suicide committed by Mariana in 2010.
However, her family thinks she was killed by her partner.
"When I arrived at her home, it seemed to me that her body had been washed," says Mrs. Buendia.
Signs indicated that she had been beaten, and body stiffness was already begun.
While her mother tells the story, a photo of Mariana clothes the wall, next to a cross where the word: Justice appears.
However, this is exactly what the family has been denied.
The authorities treated me as if I was an old lady, a troublemaker, a crying woman.
They want us to accept what they say and sit down.
"But it is not normal that there are so many irregularities and omissions," she said.
When President Pena Nieto receives his scarf on Saturday, she will bear a heavy responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by crime in Mexico over the past six years, and the new President has promised that he will make it his priority during his term of office.
"I hope he will be as good as he will be as president when he was governor," said Olvera, in Valle del Bravo, a member of Congress.
However, this is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear the most.
Bradley Manning did not complain of ill-treatment, the prosecutors declare.
Prosecutors are trying to counter claims of ill-treatment of which Bradley Manning would have been a victim during detention.
The trial is about Manning's detention in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defence wants to classify the case on the grounds that Manning's kidnapping took place under extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is accused of having seized thousands of confidential documents.
The prosecutors tried to prove, Friday, that Private Bradley Manning -- accused of being the source of the biggest leak of confidential information in the entire history of the U.S. Army -- lacks many opportunities to complain about the ill-treatment he claims to have suffered during his military detention.
During a cross-examination with Manning, during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Attorney Maj. Ashden Fein stated that weekly visits to Manning by officers during his nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, did not reveal any complaints about his treatment.
The cross-examination -- during a hearing, the defence filed a motion requiring Manning to be classified on the grounds that the kidnapping was carried out under very difficult conditions and constituted a sufficiently severe punishment -- one day after Manning testified his desire to commit suicide during his detention.
This military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of having seized thousands of confidential documents while serving in Iraq.
The documents were then published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning was their source.
At the Friday hearing, Fein discussed with Manning the forms that officers had completed after their meeting with Manning, during his detention in Quantico Military Prison, where he was subjected to maximum prison isolation from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked Manning questions and gave his answers.
When Fein referred to the forms on Friday, Manning recognized that the treatment he had reserved for his guards was "excellent" and that the treatment he had in prison was overall "very professional."
The forms reported no complaints of ill-treatment, although the officers directly questioned him about his prison treatment, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had orally expressed concerns about certain problems and that the visiting officers had discussed his concerns and indicated that they would deal with them, but did not mention the problems raised.
"They wrote "no problem" (after having addressed the concerns), and however, it did not mean that I had not raised any problems," Manning said.
Military judge Col. Denise Lind also asked Manning why he had not complained about his treatment during an interview in January 2011 with the special commission that had met to evoke the suicidal thoughts he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during the meeting was to make his restrictive status change indicating a "hazard of injury".
The military stated that they had assigned him this restrictive status -- a level below the close surveillance for risk of suicide -- for its protection and safety of others.
"I wanted the staff to know that I was doing well, and I wanted to be removed from this status... in order to enjoy a better quality of life from my point of view," Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for almost two months before being transferred to the military prison at the Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He stated that he had considered suicide when he was in Kuwait and disappeared once because of the heat.
He added that the fact that he was not aware of what was going to happen to him or what was happening in the rest of the world was very distressing.
"My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, this cage," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I was gonna die in that cage.
Once in Quantico, Manning said he had spent most of his time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours -- without company.
Manning also added that the only items he had were mattresses, blankets, tongs, clothing and glasses.
He tried to stay on the move because sleeping or lying awake during the day was contrary to the regulations.
Manning also said that when he was trying to sleep, he had a light in his eyes, lit outside his cell.
If the guards did not see his face when he turned at night, they would wake him up so that he could see his face.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint for treatment suffered by Manning in January 2011.
Manning was placed in a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
On Friday, the judge also asked Manning about an allegation in his Thursday testimony -- that after having been forced to sleep naked all night in his cell at Quantico, he was forced to stand naked before the guards and other detainees one morning during the call.
Manning testified that at no time, he was allowed to cover with cover during the call.
During the judge's questions, Friday, Manning stated that he had deviated from his guard's order that he should drop his cover that could have hidden his nudity, but he recognized that no one had ordered him to leave it.
Manning testified on Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before, because he would have tried to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning would have told the officer that he could have used the elasticity of his brief or tongs to hurt himself, but he didn't.
That night, Manning testified that his underwear, his tongs, and his glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that at least the judge will take into account his experiences during his detention and that he will greatly reduce his sentence if he should be convicted before a court of martial, a trial that should be held early next year.
The defence stated that Manning intends to plead guilty for the least serious crimes and to fight for the abandonment of other charges deemed to be too extreme.
The hearing should be resumed this weekend, with prosecutors who should argue that conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon confirmed that Manning was incarcerated in accordance with the regulations governing the conditions of detention of all detainees in Quantico.
The charges brought against Manning include theft of public property or documents, collusion with the enemy, giving rise to the illegal publication of information on the Internet, and transmission of national defence information.
If all the charges are held, he is subject to life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American identity crisis
He says that many were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunity
The Mexicans tend to blame those who are gone; they remind the Mexicans of the difficult times, he said.
Navarrette says that Mexico-Americans find themselves caught between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico, arriving in the lobby, in front of customs and immigration services, I felt lost.
Panels indicated two tracks: one for the "Mexicanos" ("Mexicoans"), another for the "Extranjeros" ("Extranjeros").
I remained motionless for several seconds, not knowing which file to lead me to.
I grew up in the center of California, where I was called the Mexican all my life.
This is an ethnic qualification, as my friends in Boston use when they call themselves "Irish", or my friends in New York when they say "Italian."
Then I became "Mexico-American."
But here it was Mexico.
And on the earth that my grandfather was born, no need for special qualifications or union traits.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, well enough to manage an interview in one language or another.
But I don't have an Aboriginal vocabulary, and I can't lose my American accent.
So I took my U.S. passport and I headed for the "Stranges" file.
I thought about that time of the week when the new Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama at the White House.
Generally, when the leaders of these two countries meet, their favorite themes are immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans should stay in Mexico rather than risk themselves in the United States.
He wished to join the United States and Canada, and to create a Trade Union on the European Union model, but in North America.
And Pena Nieto is committed to continuing the war on drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not provide any further details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and filled with bitterness.
Most Americans probably never thought about the fact that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to give in writing half of their territory at the point of the gun.
But for the Mexicans, who think in terms of centuries, and no minutes, memories are everywhere.
Therefore, as soon as a U.S. official makes the slightest criticism of Mexico, you are beginning to hear -- in the Mexican press, and among the elites -- complaints about how Americans are damaging the sovereignty of their neighbours.
And the children of Montezuma are looking for the fight.
And yet, for Mexico, the most difficult relationship is that of the country with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
You want us to talk about the subject of bitterness?
There's a lot of them.
Mexico has its winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom the country does not.
The only reason why the large number of Mexican ancestors in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at some point, in our genealogical tree, a person, perhaps a relative or grandparent, found no opportunity in Mexico and had to go to the North.
And most often, this person corresponded to a typical profile -- a dark, uneducated skin, from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even if we are currently living the American dream, that we went to good schools and we have good situations, we must never lose sight that it is the American dream that we live in, not that of Mexicans.
Our identity is sometimes disturbed, but our loyalty is obvious.
We agree with him in the United States.
Furthermore, we know that a part of the Mexican elite among the ruling class does not like us.
The feeling is reciprocal.
We remind them of a humiliating defeat and they cough us as if we were individuals of lower strain and not enough Mexican.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our links with Mexico will never be strong enough.
For them, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families had not failed when they lived in Mexico, they would never have left.
And we would not find ourselves stuck on the right side of the barrier, living comfortably in the United States, but as lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and who legally emigrated to the United States while she was a child, reminds me that there are frictions between Mexicans and Mexico-Americans, because Mexicans are more strongly claiming their identity and Mexico-Americans are opposed to it.
Although she is an American citizen, she feels that she is part of two countries.
In addition, many Mexico-Americans I know don't feel like being part of one country or another.
We love the music of the Mexican group, Los Tigers del Norte, but also that of Bruce Springsteen.
We have the best of both worlds, but we are not rooted in either.
In Mexico, we are considered Americans.
And in the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
And now, to complicate the relationship a little more, as I learned during my stay, some Mexican leaders and some of the intelligence want to get closer to Diaspora.
They want Mexico-Americans to work as ambassadors of fortune for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We will have to explain to our American compatriots that Mexico is a superb country that we must absolutely visit and pressure political leaders to strengthen the links with Mexico.
Yes, of course.
It won't happen.
There's too much bitterness.
And if we consider the inequality of wages, corruption and drug-related violence that are omnipresent, many of us are not convinced that this is a fantastic country.
You're going to have to do it alone, friends.
It's normal.
If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, they should therefore accept that some Mexican-Americans still want them in the way that their family members were treated there is not so long ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more Mexicans than I thought.
Old Querils, New Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is still a failure for peace.
Can there never be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another blood transfusion seems to indicate that such a hope is in vain.
While the same futile arguments persist to know who started, dozens of buildings were reduced to dust; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them were civilians, and six Israelis were killed; and for the first time, rockets from Gaza landed near Tel-Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although the Israelis and Palestinians seem stuck in their old conflict, all around them, the Middle East is changing.
The Arab spring has stolen everything, whether we want it or not, the Palestinians and Israelis are caught by this regional upheaval.
Perhaps their struggle will intensify a little more.
Yet, there are every reason to believe that this could help them to get out of this deadly impasse.
A War That Makes No Loser or No Win
At first glance, it seems difficult to show optimism.
Although the ceasefire granted on 21 November continues, this week's fights have strengthened the partisans of the force, both sides.
Hamas leaders, the Islamist movement that has been leading Gaza since 2007, will be tempted to force Israelis to abandon, even though Gaza has swept away a stalemate.
Having killed some of its leaders and refoulemented the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza into one of the most wretched and overcrowded corners of the planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently at the hands of their Fatah rivals, the other more moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, Hamas leaders may say that time is their ally.
The influence of Arab Islamists is increasingly strong, and Hamas has become rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a growing regional power, once the closest Muslim ally to Israel, has made and cause for Hamas; like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic states in the Gulf.
Hamas members jubilee and say that the growing Islamist curves around Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where the Hezbollah militia exercises its rule, through Syria, where Islamist rebels can overthrow Bashar El Assad, and to Jordan, where Hamas' allies threaten the king.
And most importantly, on the southern flank of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brothers under the presidency of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and most central of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the depot that ruled Egypt for 30 years until its fall in 2011, had little time to devote to Hamas.
On the other hand, the Muslim Brothers are Hamas cousins, and their leaders are more easily referring to public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas can emerge as an important actor that can no longer be excluded even by Israel and America.
Meanwhile, Israel's hardline supporters will draw the opposite conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas was put in a box.
The iron Dome missile interception system proved its effectiveness and many Hamas missiles were destroyed.
The Israelis will be able to sleep on their two ears for a while.
In terms of diplomacy, America renews its unwavering support; and many European countries have accused Hamas of being the source of the last wave of violence.
Above all, Israel has prospered, especially under the Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who has completely ignored the peace process.
Although Gaza's rocket shootings have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been spared by suicide bombings, including through the separation barrier that permeates the West Bank, the main piece of what could be a Palestinian state, and which protects Jewish colonies that continue to expand despite their illegality in international law.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose party Licusud merged with an even more bellicist party, that of leader Avigdor Lieberman at the close of the election of January 22, has the beautiful part.
Why do these Palestinian fichos dormitory by giving them a state?
If they were leading the West Bank, would they not launch rockets, as their compatriots did in Gaza?
It's better to keep them behind this wall and hit them as soon as they come out of their head.
Perhaps the supporters of the hard line will take it; but the Arab spring may change the gift.
Although Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere appreciate Israel, their priority will be to tackle the problems in their own countries.
The defence budget of Israel is more important than that of its four Arab neighbours.
Starting a war with local superpowers will not help new Arab governments to manage their economies.
Mr. Morsi worked with Barack Obama to get a ceasefire, which is a good thing -- and could mark the beginning of something.
Israelis should also think about the future.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a powder that is dedicated to exploding one day in the territories occupied by Israel - a bit like the bus that exploded in Tel-Aviv this week.
The repression has already weakened democracy in the Jewish state, and demography exacerbates this problem as the Arab population increases.
The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to ring Hamas will have a diplomatic prize.
Both sides need to be pushed by those on the outside.
The answer remains the one advocated by reasonable people on each side, and by most of the outside world and by this journal: two states, with an assignment of territory by Israel in exchange for security.
A small and short-term hope is that the ceasefire will provide an opportunity for outsiders to defend this cause.
Egypt, which must now endeavour to end the movement of arms to Gaza, as Turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in accordance with the 1967 borders with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs from outside countries should also pressure Hamas and Fatah to unite.
This would contribute much more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the forthcoming proposal for a pseudo-State to the United Nations.
Mr. Obama is also interested in Israel's willingness to negotiate.
During his first term, he did not present his own peace plan.
Back to the White House, he seems equally reluctant to establish one.
It's a very narrow vision.
The stability of the Middle East is a vital challenge for America.
This is through a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Laws for Neutral Cigarette Packs came into force in Australia
Warnings and photos of sick organs cover dark green packages that are all identical regardless of the brand
This law entered into force in Australia is a world premiere, the logos and colors were replaced by a dark green olive and horrible pictures of sick organs and representations of children and babies whose diseases were caused by the smoking of their parents.
Apart from the different pictures and health warnings, the only difference between the packages, since this Saturday, is the name of the brand, printed in small characters on all packages.
This is the most stringent tobacco packaging regime in the world.
The Australian federal government stated that the goal was to deter young people from smoking by removing glamour.
Studies have shown that if people did not start smoking before the age of 26, there is 99% chance that they will never start.
"Even when they are very young, children include the message from tobacco manufacturers through their brand image," said the Federal Minister of Health, Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that have shown, for example, that children associated the crown of a logo with a princess."
Although Australia has the lowest smoking rate in the world and these changes have little impact on the benefits of multinationals, other countries are considering a similar approach.
The tobacco industry has pressured this law.
Tobacco manufacturers said that this would boost the black market trade, which would make it easier to access cheaper cigarettes.
"The harmful consequences will arise from this legislation," said Scott McIntyre of the British American Tobacco Australia.
China and Indonesia faucets will sell much more counterfeit cigarettes on Australia's streets.
Others stated that this law had motivated their activity.
Sandra Ha de Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said that the demand for cigarette cases, including silicone to mask the horrible packaging, has greatly increased two months ago since British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco challenged the law and lost in front of Australia's high court.
He said Zico sold 6,000 to wholesalers and is waiting for stock renewal.
For us, business is good.
The only problem, the experts say, is the popularity of social media and the population segment targeted by the plan.
After a series of Australian laws prohibiting TV advertising, sports sponsorship and the obligation for resellers to conceal cigarettes, tobacco marketing is now available online.
Australia has banned advertising on the Web by businesses and local sites, but it cannot prevent foreign sites from doing so.
"If you work in tobacco marketing and you only have a small window to promote your products, the Internet is the perfect place," said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noticed an increase in the contributions of some Lambda citizens to brands on social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
Do we have to ask ourselves whether he is a mere citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes and who has been sad to make a video, or whether it is a marketing campaign orchestrated by an agency?
British American Tobacco Australia stated that the industry focuses on the new regulation in force rather than on marketing.
The industry went to pay for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge these new judicial decisions - these countries told WHO that trade was unfairly disadvantaged, although none of these countries had significant trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected to be taken in 2013.
Plibersek said the government had discussions with other countries about similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to make packaging warning photos mandatory in 2001.
These warnings are now present in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Severe laws are currently being studied in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these photos.
The pictures don't bother me.
I don't know.
"You take a cigarette and you store the package," said Victor El Hage at the time of buying a package on which is a picture of a tumor in his mouth.
To be honest, the only reason I'm gonna be arrested is my little girl.
James Yu, manager of the "King of the Pack tobacconist" in central Sydney, said that the uniformity of the packaging made it difficult to store packages on the shelves.
"Before I needed an hour to unload a package, now I need four hours," Yu said.
"The government only had to ban them once for all and we would have said OK, OK, we stop and put the key under the door," he added, raising our arms to the sky.
In a constantly connected world, it may be good to get bored.
I spent five hours at an airport during the Thanksgiving period, because our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
Therefore, I have had enough time to think about the theme of boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spending half a day at an airport to wait for a flight is quite boring, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to distract you (not forgetting duty-free shops).
But more and more, some academics and experts in the development of children praise boredom.
It is perfectly normal for us - and our children - to get bored from time to time, they say.
This forces the brain to take interesting paths, or even to nourish creativity.
And since we are, for the most part, constantly in front of several types of screens, we no longer know the benefits of boredom.
So should we welcome boredom with open arms?
Yes.
And no.
But I'll come back.
First of all, like many people, I thought boredom was a rather recent phenomenon, especially since we have more free time.
But this is not the case, says Peter Toohey, professor of Greek-Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011).
"The trouble goes very far," he says.
On the walls of Pompeii are Latin graffiti that evokes boredom, they date back to the first century.
Then there's the definition that we're giving to boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined and discussed in various ways, said John D. Eastwood, an Associate Professor of Psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After going through many publications and submitting the idea to a discussion group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience that consists of "wanting to do something, but not getting started in a satisfactory activity."
What differentiates the boringness of apathy, he says, is that the person is not undertaking a task even though she would like it to.
With apathy, he says, there's no desire to do anything.
What is at the heart of trouble, he said, is "the interruption of the attention process, associated with a maussed mood and the feeling that time passes slowly."
Annoyance can be very much like depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that if both can be linked, people who get bored tend to think that the problem comes from the environment or the world, while people who are depressed think that the problem comes from them.
Sometimes we think that we are in trouble when this is actually a problem of concentration.
As part of their study, "The Unengned Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", which was published in the newspaper "Perspectives on Psychological Science" in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues highlighted an earlier experience in which participants listened on tape, the voice of a person reading a magazine article.
Some groups heard, from the next room, the sound too high of a TV show that had no reports, others just heard the TV show, and the third group did not at all hear the soundtrack.
Those who heard TV at a low sound level said they were more bored than the other two groups - they had trouble concentrating, but they did not know why, and attributed this problem of concentration to boredom.
When you try to focus on a difficult or challenging task, an interruption of attention may lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, an aggregate neuroscience professor at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you perform a tiresome task, "like looking at objects on an assembly chain, music can help you not to get bored."
In fact, he says, now, we know that when you torturing or gryphoning, these gestures, often regarded as signs of boredom, are in fact a good way to stay physically more alert.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to gigote learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to stay motionless," said Professor Fenske.
We all get bored one day or the other - the delay of my plane flight, a speaker with a monocord voice, a particularly boring film.
But some people are more likely to get bored than others.
To measure this, researchers developed a "worn predisposition scale" in the 1980s.
The scale includes statements like, "For the tasks I do, many of them are repetitive and monotonous," and "I have so many centers of interest that I don't have time to do everything."
Using such a scale, researchers have discovered that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, and in particular need numerous and varied stimulations.
In general, though, teenagers are quickly blamed.
In 1991, Reed Larson, an individual and community-based professor at the University of Illinois, conducted an experience in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day via a beeper.
He noted that 32 percent of teenagers reported having trouble at school and during homework at home, while 23 percent said they were bored when they were not at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of the parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether today's boredom rates, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he added that he knew that "adolescence is a time when boredom reaches its highest level", especially because children and adolescents do not have much control over what they want to do.
If I rest my question, is the trouble good for you?
Sometimes not, because in its extreme form, it can cause people to take absurd physical risks, bets or abuse certain substances to spend time, as studies show.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers point to a link between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying the problem for more than two decades.
"The bore is the way the brain has found to let you know that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the N.Y.U.
But the brain does not always know what is the most appropriate thing to do.
If you get bored and use this energy to play guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will make you happy in the short term, but not in the long term.
So if your child gets bored and you give him an iPad, he won't get bored, but he won't learn to take care of himself or himself, says Professor Fenske.
And "this self-regulation goes from one situation to another," he says.
Your child not only learns to have fun, he gets more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should glorify boredom.
Just as I don't think we should criticize him.
Feel comfortable outside of the constant bubbling that generates the activities and technology is the goal to which we should tend.
Professor Eastwood agrees on this.
"We need to get bored more often, but boredom awakens an acute and frenetic desire to be connected to something that has meaning," he said.
According to him, what people are looking for is a way to disconnect and appreciate the stopping times.
"In an environment where we are constantly hyperstimulated," he added, "it is difficult to find ways to get into something when the noise stops."
In Colorado, no directive for the new marijuana law
Anthony Orozco, 19, a university student and footballer in Colorado, is charged for something that will soon become legal in his condition: possession of marijuana balls and a pipe used to smoke them.
Mr. Orozco said that one day, in September, he and a few friends were on board a car in Lamar, in the middle of the fields, near the Kansas border, when they were arrested.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a summons to appear for possession of drugs and equipment that could be used for his consumption - minor crimes, each with a fine of $100 - and a date of appearance.
"We are treated as criminals," said Mr. Orozco.
But is it one?
During the weeks of uncertainty that followed Colorado's vote to legalize the consumption of small amounts of marijuana for its personal use, the response to hundreds of cases involving low drug use depends more on the place than the law.
Here and in the state of Washington, which has adopted a similar measure, hundreds of crimes involving marijuana use have been promptly classified.
Police have stopped indicting adults aged 21 and over for possession of marijuana because the law will come into force in the coming weeks.
But the prosecutors who are in the most conservative districts of Colorado have called on them to speed up the existing marijuana business and continue to blame the people who own it.
At the same time, several towns in the suburbs of Denver up to the western mountains are currently voting to prevent the opening of state-approved marijuana sales shops in their neighbourhoods.
"Things are changing so quickly that I don't know what the future holds," said Daniel J. Oates, head of police in Aurora, east of Denver.
Washington State regulators also have some serious questions.
They are looking for guidelines on how to install a permit system, allowing to produce, manufacture, distribute and sell - before the deadline of December 1, 2013.
They say Colorado, whether it is desired or not, is in advance of most of the regulatory states on marijuana, first of all with regard to therapeutic use and now with regard to personal use.
"The Colorado has a more regulated market, and is a good indicator," said Brian E. Smith, spokesperson for the Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But no place or system, Mr Smith recognizes, can do more than suggest what works.
"There is no real precedent on which we could rely," he said.
Washington's law, called I-502, takes effect on December 6, leaving a one-year legal vacuum, during which the permit system still does not exist, while the possession of marijuana will be legal.
During this time, practical questions remain outstanding: how to balance the mandate of the state that guarantees adequate access to approved marijuana and prohibits the installation of cannabis sales within a radius of 30 km around a school, a park, a playground or a nursery.
"There will be no more difficult places than urban areas to install an approved cannabis trade, particularly in Seattle's metropolitan area," said Ben Livingston, a spokesperson at the Centre for Cannabis Legalization, a recently formed research group.
On 21 November, the Chief of Police, Oates, in Aurora, sent an e-mail to his officers announcing that the "City attorney" (public prosecutor's representative) would no longer continue the 21-year-old and older people with small quantities of marijuana, and that the police should stop blaming people for this type of crime "in immediate effect."
Chief Oates stated that the police would implement the new judicial decisions that regulate the activity of those who cultivate marijuana for medical purposes, and that he would continue to pursue drug traffickers and dealers.
In Weld County, northern Colorado, the "district attorney" (Procurator of the Republic), Ken Buck, represents a stricter vision.
After the vote, he stated that his office would continue to deal with marijuana possession cases, mainly in order to pressure users to become detoxified.
At present, 119 persons are charged with possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many of them are the subject of other charges.
"Our office has an obligation to prosecute those persons who committed an offence which, at the time of the facts, was a recognized offence," said Buck.
The reactions were complicated even in rural areas such as Mesa County, where voters rejected the initiative for limited marijuana consumption.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer show up adults for limited quantities.
The representative of the Public Prosecutor's Office of the County, Pete Hautzinger, supported this decision, but also decided not to immediately classify all cases of marijuana detention.
"I don't feel like wasting my time applying the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, offering a legal and governmental framework appropriate to marijuana's personal consumption is not an easy thing.
And the contradictory reactions that have been observed in different American cities highlight the deep ambivalence among local officials with regard to the legalization of marijuana.
"This is a cultural barrier" with the representatives of the Public Prosecutor's Office, said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents those accused of marijuana consumption and who speaks as a local spokesperson of the "National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws" (National Organization for the Reform of Laws on marijuana).
"They have spent much of their lives prosecuting people who consume marijuana, too, have a hard time accepting that it is legal," he said.
As early states to treat limited marijuana consumption at the same level as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are becoming a case of jurisprudence for drug law.
While state defenders and representatives provide for a new legalized sales border, they are anxiously awaiting the federal government's directives, which always design the sale and culture of marijuana as federal crimes.
Defenders of the legalization of marijuana hope that the Ministry of Justice will give way.
Despite some mediated arrests of therapeutic marijuana and sellers, the federal government has mainly allowed marijuana sales for therapeutic purposes in Colorado, Washington and in 16 other states.
While it is true that the police are probably not going to sink the doors to grab small drug bags, there is much to bet that it is opposed to the licensed marijuana sales for personal use authorized by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former political advisor to the Obama administration.
Many cities in Colorado did not expect federal authorities to act.
Long before the vote, some local governments have approved moratoriums on the creation of new marijuana sales, even if it is only a one-year postponement.
Last week, the city of Montrose obtained a moratorium of 6 months, and it is expected to impose this ban next week.
"We don't want to find ourselves in a situation where a permit is granted to someone and then meet with a federal problem," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the municipal council.
Our community has voted against this amendment.
We are interested in the community's vote rather than the state's vote.
Many questions arise.
Petronella Wyatt: I was damaged and excluded from Oxford because I was a Tory.
It is not only today's students who are attacked for their opinions.
As far as I remember, I've always dreamed of entering the University of Oxford.
My father and older brother studied in what was for me an eminent place to know, a kind of Greek amphitheatre of modern times that stimulates the two pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
Yet, two weeks after I settled in Worcester College in the late 1980s to study history, I decided to pack my bags, causing the first scandal in my life.
My father broke down and started crying.
My friends were discouraged.
The newspaper L'Evening Standard claimed that I left this university because I objected to the fact that first-cycle students had sex in the room next to mine.
Author A.N. Wilson said with facsimile that I was leaving after I had been forced to drink in crushed cups.
The truth was less funny.
I left.
Yes, I ran away, because I had been the victim of intimidation and was constantly being bullied.
Not because of my name rather annoyance, nor because I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one and only reason, and in this cradle of the so-called knowing, I was the victim of racist and barbaric behaviour: my sorry father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influential advisor to Margaret Thatcher and I was a Conservative Party partisan.
Why do you mention it today, you'll tell me.
Well, recent studies have revealed that a new generation of right-centre students suffer the same type of persecution.
The growing and institutionalized hatred of Tory students in Oxford is such that last week, some of them demanded protection of their rights, as well as those of gays, persons with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
The Conservative members of Corpus Christi College's Student Room (JCR) stated that they were "often isolated, personally attacked and felt undesirable" because of their political views.
They want a representative on the University Committee for Equal Opportunities so that their views can be expressed freely.
Their situation was not facilitated by the recent documentary broadcast on BBC Two "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" ("The land of wonders: Young, Intelligent and Right"), devoted to politics among students, and depicting "Tories" as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
In particular, the student Joe Cooke, former president of the "Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA)", who travels in Rolls-Royce, has a full silver tree and moves with a chromed head cane.
In other universities, conservative students claim to be treated as emissary branches of the establishment of increased tuition fees."
Luke Black, 20 years old, Vice-President of the Nottingham University Conservative Association, told a Sunday newspaper "that there is a growing left-wing party in universities.
People think we're like Bullingdon Club without even meeting us."
21-year-old Samuel Roberts, a history student at Corpus Christi, who proposed a motion for more protection, says that such a climate is "uncomfortable", and Stephanie Cherill, 19-year-old president of the OUCA, says that there has been a deterioration in the attitude of JCR members towards people who are right-centred.
"This constitutes a barrier to the freedom of intellectual debate, as well as to the well-being of members," she said.
I was the only one thinking this way in my first few weeks in Oxford.
I went into September 1986, when I was 18 years old and had a paralysing shyness.
The hate of the conservative party was very virulent.
The previous year, the university had voted for the refusal to grant Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary title, due to the reduction in higher education funding.
The atmosphere was charged with Stalinian vibrations.
From the first days of the reception week, when the new students met with others and teachers, I had a foretaste of what was going to happen later.
I discovered that teachers not only participated in sarcasms against Tory students, but also enjoyed them.
It was as if the policy of the underage, privatization and opposition of the government to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa were engraved in the wood of the classrooms.
The first sarcasm I was the victim of involved a translation into English of the 18th century French texts, and I was not prepared there.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "keep translating the first paragraph"
I lost my foot.
Pitt, a little man with a pustullous face, easily took hold of himself.
"Do Thatcherists refuse to learn French or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students laughed.
Tears burned my eyes.
"I suggest you take French courses during your free time - finally, if you're not too busy making friends," he launched a hard tone.
I went back to my room, unsolved.
At dinner tonight, I sat alone and felt a little tape on my shoulder.
He was a second year student of English studies, named James, who became a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said, gently.
I'm afraid so.
Any person suspected of being a Tory (conservative) is targeted.
It's hard enough for me, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be even harder for you.
Most of the Tory youth claim to be Labour (workers).
Later, at the local pub, I slowly tried to hide.
I insisted that I disagreed with everything Mrs Thatcher said.
This stratagem failed.
A first-year student in philosophy, political and economic sciences who had, ironically, studied in Eton, said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're contaminated.
Other students took the lead.
I was perverted, you son of a bitch.
"How do the Tories make love?" asked one of them.
They hit each other, don't they?"
I felt like homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Could I just lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I have been forced to meet people who share the same views only after the fall of the night?
Should I have become a Labourman and deny my opinions?
The next three years would look like a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only openly Professor Tory was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history, who taught in my university.
He was hated not only because he was a Conservative, but also because he was an external policy adviser to Thatcher and one of his speakers.
He was almost never there.
He hated this provincial and insignificant place, as well as his accession to the Marxist-Determinist point of view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a position as a professor at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he said.
I began to take a shuttle between Oxford and my parents' house in London, finding refuge with my family and my more open-minded fellow citizens.
I told my father I hated Oxford and I explained why.
He was unbelievable.
During his studies in Oxford in the 1940s, all political points of view were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said patheticly.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city to the dreamy bells.
Even my Communist friends had irreproachable ways.
He had tears in his eyes.
Give them a chance.
I'm sure it's to takin' you.
It would break my heart if you left Oxford.
Tired by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance has gradually deteriorated.
A friend, also Tory, succumbed to pressure and gave up his convictions.
During a work session led the following week, when another history teacher suggested the most seriously of the world, that I was "an enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
I admitted to being a victim of my parents' brainwashing and treated them with "foolish old."
The repetition was short-lived.
It's my father who broke the last nail in my Oxford coffin.
At that time, he wrote two columns in Murdoch's press every week.
My door was locked.
I sat in my room, and after five minutes, my chasers left.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can treat me with wet chicken pleurnichard.
But no 18-year-old child should be subjected to such intimidation in a school.
The most tragic thing is that it was Oxford, which not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers, but also enjoyed an unwavering reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
As part of the exhibition "Valentino: a Master of the Couture", opened this week in London, ABC interviewed Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian Couturier.
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth Ire of England, is the only place in the British capital to host an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The couture recognized it at the inauguration of "Valentino: a Master of the Couture", a prestigious retrospective that brings together over 130 high-cooked models created for its sewing house over the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he said with his inimitable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the organ of a story whose only protagonist is "the Lord" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his famous clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and apart from the nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until 3 March, we find an impressive number of private letters and pictures signed by the cream of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, passing through Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino presents his personal memories as the trophies of his social ascension: from the modest couture of the town of Voghera, north of Italy, to the idol of the international jetset.
There's nothing wrong with loving royalty.
"At least, they don't crush their cigarette cheeks on your beautiful rug like some pop music stars do," says Barone Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and we were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and receives with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved being invited to his chalet in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, an intimate friend of past beauty like Marella Agnelli or Eugénie Niarchos.
Valentino always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And even so, he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino model
The Argentinian mannequin, Valeria Mazza, did not forget the couture's charism.
Several years ago, after a parade at the Spanish Square in Rome, we went to his apartment for dinner.
We were about twenty people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
We saw and felt his mind in every detail of his apartment, in decoration, food, music.
"With him, each guest felt important and appreciated," recalls the "top model", which began working with him during the week of the Haute-Couture in Paris in 1995.
"It will never pass out of fashion, because its creations are works of art," she concludes.
Defiled Noblese Line
Garavani's life is not a story of obsessions but of shared love.
He loves the high people and with the greatest titles and they also like it.
One of Somerset House's galleries has been transformed into a 60-metre- wide glamour podium that proposes to exchange roles: the visitor takes the place of the mannequins and must parade on the podium to admire a "public" dream with the main creations of Valentino, such as the tailor Jackie Kennedy had chosen for her marriage with Aristotle Onassis, the costume that Monica Vitti wore in "La Notte", or a wool coat and fur that belonged to the Empress Farah Diba.
This mannequin audience includes names such as Sybille de Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit de Norway, Rosario de Bulgaria or Sophie de Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the Couturier in 2006
Many of his clients say that Valentino's first clothes are like the first love, "unforgettable to forget".
I remember it very well.
It was a trousers, a shirt, a vest "gillette" and a jacket from the 1971-1972 fall-winter collection.
"It's a gift he gave me," said Naty Abascal, one of the couture museums.
"I prefer him to all others for his femininity, his great love of women, and because he sublimes our beauty," adds Feria's former Duchess.
I really like the colors he uses, they're bright and light up his face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and moderate Patricia della Giompaola d'Arenberg can also not forget the first time she wore a Valentino model.
When she was a teenager and she lived in Italy, she dreamed of having the age and opportunity to wear one of her evening dresses...
Finally, this was possible in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino model for a party in my cousin's castle, Prince Edouard of Line.
It was a red night's dress, with a flying skirt, a strapped buster and a cut-off to fall.
"It was a dream come true," said the widow of Rodrigue d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, he is obsessed with timeless," explains the Italian aristocrat who shares his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess of Arenberg retains the costumer's evening dresses with "the greatest care, because a night dress is not only a dress, it is also the whole souvenirs that she carries".
The "king" of mode
The grand final of Somerset House's exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress worn during his marriage to Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "gazze" (the couturier thus calls his coutures) to make this dress in ivory silk with pearl incrustations, twelve different types of laces and a four-and-a-half-metre drag.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the specialized press, this dress represents a historical fact of the high seam of the late twentieth century, "the return of the customers of the high society".
Over the years for the "know-being" of nobility, Valentino is now his best representative.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the greatest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, decorated with the Légion d'Honneur, Garavani gathers as many honours as any of his clients.
"Its refinement, its calmness, its careful and perfect look have always jumped to my eyes," acknowledges Arenberg.
The last time I saw him, it was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was sitting at the table of the Countess Jacqueline of Ribes, one of my great friends.
"He was impeccable, years have no effect on him."
If it's a princess who says it...
The Hardest Job in the World: Kawah Ijen's Human Mules
For four euros, Indonesian volcano carriers risk their lives and health by carrying 70 kilos of sulphur through steep stone trails.
There are people for whom work is a hell and others who literally work in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 minors who earn their livelihood by bringing the sulphur of the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
He has to work every day to the bottom of the crater, where the sulfuric gas emanating from the ends of the earth solidifies himself to the contact of air.
After harvesting large sulphur rocks, which weigh almost 70 kilos in total, he installs them in two bamboo baskets that he loads on his shoulders through the steep trails.
There is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano that peaks at 2,386 meters high, but exhausted carriers take more than 40 minutes to climb this distance, to a turtle allure, keeping the balance and measuring their steps so as not to trip and fall into the precipice.
They know that a fake could not cost them their lives, as it happened to a French tourist who took a deadly fall in the Kawah Ijen volcano several years ago.
The children of Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents for each kilo of sulphur extract.
Once at the top, he set a path between the tourists who photograph them as if they were circus beasts, and carrying painfully the heavy baskets, they walk the 3 kilometers to the balance that a mining company has set up a little below at 1,850 meters altitude.
It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been operating the volcano since 1960 and, it can be said, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents) per kilo of sulphur.
It then sells it to the petrochemical industry at 10,000 rupees (83 cents) since this ore is very present in everyday life and is used to manufacture candles, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamide and even serves to whiten sugar.
"As we carry about 70 kilos, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each trip," explains Anto, who usually makes three trips a day.
Everyone takes 3 hours and ends up exhausted, but this allows him to earn 138,000 rupees (EUR 11,50) at the end of the day.
Although this seems to be a misery for such a superhuman effort, it is the triple of what it would gain in the fields.
"The income of minors is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros) per day and where the average monthly wage is 2 million rupees (167 euros)", says the porter who once worked as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.20 euros) per day and work was not as difficult, but then he returned to his family in Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a reason that in Indonesia is as indisputable as the sulfur: "I married a young girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought him back to Java to convert to Islam."
Then he suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly, and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At 27 years of age, he spent three of his life challenging the danger over the Kawah ljen, but the sulfur has already begun to pay him the bill although he covers his face with a mask and wears special gloves.
Then he suffers from asthma, breathing with difficulty, constantly coughing and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases released by the volcano.
It's the price he has to pay to continue his dream.
"I'm going to work another two years, because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French," he promises in a more than acceptable English.
This friendly, intelligent young man could be a tourist guide, server or receptionist in a hotel, but instead, he does the work of a mule.
He shares an unhealthy wood size with other carriers, wakes up every day at two hours in the morning because the sulfur keeps falling at night, when its characteristic yellow color becomes blue and shines in the middle of the darkness.
Declaring the darkness, then going down into the crater by lighting up with a small lamp fixed to his helmet, that he bought himself with his own money.
Some 400 carriers load the sulphur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater.
Despite its comfortable profits, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of sulphur to save costs and provides no equipment to the carriers who work on their behalf and are paid by weight.
Moreover, they also do not touch a sub of the 30,000 rupees (EUR 2.50) of magnification per camera, in addition to the entry of 15,000 rupees (EUR 1.20), that the guards of this natural park charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This work is done for beasts, not for humans," protestes Madrusin, a 42-year-old body-bearer who has worked in Kawah Ijen for thirty years, since he left college.
Capable of carrying up to 110 kilos, he ensures that he will not stop working "as long as he can", because he needs money to raise his 3 sons, aged 10 to 18.
I won't retire, I'll die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although the sulfur damages the throat and irrits the eyes when the wind turns and trapes the minors in the thick columns of smoke that come out of the volcano, they are so hardened that no one complains about suffering serious diseases... which are of course added to their usual respiratory problems, arthrosis, pain in the knees and shoulders, deformed by the weight of the baskets.
By balancing the basket on his back, Unainik, 53 years old, can only load 50 kilos.
Every day, his companions and they extracted 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which three trucks carry to the Tamasari warehouse, 18 kilometres from there by a goat path invaded by the weeds.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life," says Unainik, opening his mouth well, revealing several missing teeth.
His five-year-old, 30-year-old, also works as a sulfur carrier.
Time passes, but the perpetual misery of generation by generation is one of the most difficult occupations in the world: the one that makes the human mules of the Kawah ljen volcano.

Singaporeans are responsible for this absence of children on the career, stress and cost of access to property.
"The people of Singapore must grow."
I am a husband and a patriot, you are my wife and a patriot, let's fulfill our civic duty and give life!
It may seem immeasurable that these words come from an advertising for mint pills, but nevertheless, or perhaps thanks to this, the video has spread like a dust drag on YouTube to Singapore at the beginning of this year.
The words come from a rap group that uses local references like "Allons put a polychinel in the drawer" to mock Singapore's birth rate.
BBH, the advertising agency at the origin of the video, hopes to draw attention to the problem in a funny way thanks to this advertisement.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, stated that he wanted to use the power of music to make people fulfil their "national duty".
It is intended only for the Internet, so we were able to make it fun and fun.
This is the main problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the area of birth, so we felt that it was a theme we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried many things like throwing perfumes at pheromones or organizing speed-dating parties.
Many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily work.
So we said this: what is more creative to solve this problem than to make a rap song of it?
1.2 children
The Government of Singapore does not take it that lightly.
It spends $1,300 a year in politics to encourage its citizens to have more children.
A government measure for marriages and fathers grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
Singapore's birth rate, according to its national population distribution, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it found itself above 2, considered to be the rate of renewal, was in 1976.
So why don't the Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of marriage and family policies of the National Population Division, says it is due to "better education" and "a wider choice of career opportunities".
"It has enabled people to have a wider range of options in terms of goals of life and priorities, beyond marriage and the creation of a family," she explains.
These changes in social standards have contributed to an increase in the number of singles and a delay in marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at radically increasing immigration to counter the population's decline has created resentment within the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites that offer barely disguised xenophobia against new immigrants, in particular Chinese who are accused of taking wages down and not integrating.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the party in Singapore has experienced last year's worst election results since independence.
Since the elections, they have tried to address the problem with the introduction of higher quotas and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the decline in the birth rate has known effects on a country's economic growth, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore's example also has unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to avoid the construction of many small homes.
For example, this has begun to touch the real estate sector.
Urban development authorities have begun to control the number of small apartments, known as a shoebox, which can be built in specific areas of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and their sale is very successful.
However, the authorities are concerned that they can promote a single lifestyle and discourage promoters wishing to build large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, director general of the real estate company EL Developers, says that his "shoe boxes" are sold much faster than larger housing.
They are more popular, in the sense that these dwellings are built much faster than those larger.
For this reason, it is much more profitable for our treasury.
However, he admitted that the new standards gave clearer instructions to the promoters, who had previously been put on wheels if they wished to offer too many small housings in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
So much so that these new regulations can be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, by discussing with the Singaporeans working in the financial district of the centre, it would seem that they do not have much effect.
"People are very stressed, homes are expensive, just like education, that's why people give it back later," says a young frame.
Other people may have children.
"But for me, it's important to be able to have my money and my time," another young man in his 20s tells us.
Men and women mention their careers, the stress and the cost of access to property and education as reasons for preventing them from having children.
So, although the government is trying to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, it is the Singaporeans themselves who have the last word.
What is off-line is off-line private
Confidentiality
According to the Spanish Royal Academy Dictionary, it is about the quality of the private domain or "the domain of private life that we can protect from any intrusion".
What is the private domain for under 16 years?
How can this definition be applied in everyday life and on social networks?
Does it understand the dangers to which it is exposed by broadcasting events that it would certainly not share offline?
The newspaper elPeriodico interviewed five young boys between the ages of 10 and 15, frequent users of the canvas.
In four of the cases, they associated the term "something very personal" personally and "the password and user name" when they applied it to social networks.
"I won't reveal my most personal secrets in a post," says Jorge, ten years old, when he tries to explain the meaning of the private term on websites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has been holding an account for two years.
"These are very secret secrets, my mother can know them but not everyone," he says.
On FB, I post nice pictures or games.
I'm also talking to my friends.
"I won't share one of my pictures or someone who'd make the fool," he says.
The boy admitted that it was wrong to publish obscene pictures, naked people, crimes or write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge ensures that he knows his 35 friends on FB and his nine subscribers on Twitter.
The majority are family.
Her mother is part of it, she knows the password of one of the accounts.
I opened up a Twitter account to express and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just post them," he says.
"Social networks are fun, I can talk to distant parents or my friends, quickly," he says.
He claims that he would never accept the request of an unknown person.
Nor will he trust someone who would recommend him to a foreigner.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, on the latter, he admits not to know 20 of the people on his list of friends.
"It doesn't worry me because we have something in common, for example, music," he says.
According to the young man, no one made advances to him or asked him for his address or phone number.
"If they put pressure on me or demanded it, I'd just delete them from my account," he admits.
José subscribed to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
Today's experiences under the name of cyberharcement are not foreign to the young boy.
A close friend of one of my friends was racked up on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was," he said.
The victim, according to José, did not close his account.
"He just passed it in private."
He then explains to us a series of manipulations to securely set up his account.
Unlike Jorge, this young woman would post photos of knowledge in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would if I was angry or angry.
"Even if I know it's cyberharging," he says.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, professor of English and graduate in Education and Learning, considers that, in order to guide children and adolescents, it must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet has emerged as a way of looking for information but, with the appearance of these sites, the rule of the game has changed," she says.
Porras reports that academic Marc Prensky, who owns a master in pedagogy at Yale University and author of the book "Natives and Digital Immigrants", uses these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives are children and young people who have been born with technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who need to be taught there, while we are learning ourselves," she says.
He adds that the theme is complex, "because we ask them to have a defined criterion on what is appropriate or not to disclose, publish or say at an age where they do not have the maturity necessary to do so".
"We also ask them to be selective when what matters most to them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," she adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach confidentiality to children and adolescents is to use questions that make them reflect.
"They say they don't do it is useless," she says.
Then Porras lists some examples: there are things that you wouldn't tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or would you like them to publish a photo of you like that of a friend you posted?
Do you know what the others are publishing on you?
When you identify holiday photos, do you ask other people to be allowed to identify them?
And also, does everyone need to know what you're doing at any given moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they must act online as they do offline.
They're the same rules.
"On the Internet, everyone must act with respect, morality and other principles, it must be the same on social networks," she says.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, professor of university, primary school and educational adviser, states that it is essential for parents to read consciously the conditions of use of social networks.
By including each of the terms, they will have a solid basis for discussing with their children the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to share or publish," he says.
According to Guardia, it is essential to remind children not to speak to strangers.
The Unasur summit ended without the Lima Declaration being made public
The VIth Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) today ended in Peru without the release of the Lima Declaration, although it was previously announced and theoretically adopted by the seven representatives present.
Ephe tried several times to access the document signed at the VIth Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency initially indicated that it would be disclosed after the summit was closed, and then stated that it would be published at one time on the Peruvian government's website at another.
When questioned on the text, they reported that its content had been presented by the President of Peru, Ollante Humala, in brief press statements.
The access of journalists to information on the summit has been constantly limited.
During the day, only the video without the sound of the presidential assembly with the message "private session, restricted audio" was broadcast in the press room.
The limited information circulated among journalists was that given by the press officers of some of the Unasur governments that attended the meeting, with the exception of the Peruvian spokesperson.
The only document released during the day was the list of presidents present, which caused some discomfort among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who demanded more important information.
Later, Peru's presidency sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it was the speech of President Humala and not of the official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru was host to the Third Summit of South America (ASPA) and, on that occasion, although this was requested by the press, it had also not circulated the declaration also called the Lima Declaration, as previously announced.
On the ASPA official site, it can be verified that the document was published in March last year.
In both international meetings, Peruvian authorities have tried to put in place safe transmission systems for all journalists, but they have limited information to the maximum.
The summit also concluded with the joint agreement of Chile and Peru to accept a judgment of the Hague Court that splits a different border between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met at the regional meeting and declared that they would respect the ICJ's decision to hear the supporters of both parties in the trial that Lima had attempted against Santiago and that began on Monday in The Hague.
"We will respect and execute the verdict that will resolve the disputes that we are bringing before this international court today," said President Humala, next to his Chilean counterpart.
"Chili has always been, and will continue to be a country that respects international law, the peaceful resolution of international disputes, treaties and tribunals," added President Piñera, giving President Humala a hand in hand, alongside the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of the two presidents that they would submit to the ICJ took place after Colombia had denounced this week the Bogota Pact by which it had agreed to submit to the decisions of this international tribunal, after a decision on the maritime limits with Nicaragua that it considered to be gravely erroneous.
The summit was held without the presence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the removal of its former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was charged with opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The representative read out the outcome document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that the lines of action of 31 projects had been established among South American countries for a total of $17 million in investment.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the countries of Unasur would set up "significant steps to achieve the goal of South American citizenship through the development of agreements on residence permits".
He reported that actions would be put in place to improve "cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and international organized crime, actions to improve drug accessibility, low-price Internet access throughout South America, and to jointly and effectively assess the risks of natural disasters".
With a Europe in crisis, "economic consolidation (Latin America) must not have a triomphalist matrix but must help to increase our productive matrix and to see a better future for our people," said President Humala.
"We decided to prefer a group of 31 emblematic projects that improve the connection of South America's spaces, especially in rural and border areas... by joining our countries and generating new economic circuits," said the president of Peru during a speech.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five concerned Peru and were on the transversal axes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and that two were aiming for a greater connection with Ecuador although it did not provide further details.
Similarly, the outcome document mentions the political situation of Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will lead to its reintegration into the Union of South American Nations", from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and having good relations with its neighbours, is another theme addressed at the summit.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos stated, before starting the regional meeting, that he hoped to meet with his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, the following Saturday in Mexico to calmly discuss the maritime dispute through a ICJ judgment requested by Bogota.
"It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday) I have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," said President Santos.
"We are going to review all these routes, they are not exhaustive, including the treaty with Nicaragua that will ask for a discussion with that country," he said.
"I hope I can tell President Ortega that we will deal with this in the most civilized and respectful manner possible," said President Santos.
Presidents Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico where they have planned to attend the takeover of the new president of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Similarly, within the framework of the summit, the Ministers of Defence of the bloc will meet in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus in terms of defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are part of Unasur, although the latter country is suspended.
Peru holds the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from Europe how to integrate citizenship," says Rafael Correa.
Ecuador's President Rafael Correa said today that the creation of a common citizenship was an objective for which "South America, in this case, should take an example on Europe".
President Correa, who participated in the VIth Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), located in Lima, told state television, TV Peru, that Europeans "have met during the Second World War" and in other conflicts, "but now they were almost a homeland".
In this regard, he defended the project of establishing South American citizenship encouraged by Unasur member countries.
"It is necessary to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case for the Andean Community members, but there are still reactionary areas that we want to make belong to the past" he warned.
In addition, the President of Ecuador supported the reconstitution of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the aim of reducing the influence of Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account the signatories to the San José Human Rights Pact.
Those who fight our ears never compromise, on the other hand, we South Americans have all signed it.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is located in Washington under the financing of the United States," he said, referring to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa ensures that he does not regret his decision, because he himself has not betrayed his principles, but instead has respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He concluded that at the time, "there were well-founded suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that his trial would not be respected".
In addition, he criticized Swedish justice, which required him to submit himself to an interrogation concerning an alleged sexual offence while "the Swedish legislation allows him to do so by videoconference, which could be done since Ecuador's embassy in London."
Correa claimed that there was a risk that Assange's mental and physical health would deteriorate.
"I haven't spoken to him since he was in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a little lung problem, but nothing serious," Ecuadorian president said.
It is possible that his physical and mental health may deteriorate by being confined to a small space without being able to do outdoor exercises.
"This works on the health of anyone," he concludes.
Correa reports that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June at the Equatorian Embassy in London, which would be the assignment of a driver who would allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities, and he stresses that he has had discussions in London to find a solution to the detention of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use this word in this case, but there have been permanent discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities, as Assange's lawyer Baltazar Garzón has launched a whole series of proceedings with different European bodies," he said.
And he thinks that "if Britain gave the exception-guide tomorrow, it would end."
And if Sweden, as it quite permits its legislation, and as it has already done in other cases, asked Mr Assange at the Embassy of Ecuador in London, or questioned it via Skype tomorrow, the problem would also be solved.
Correa took advantage of it to reaffirm itself as a defender of the freedom of the press and he said that what he did not tolerate was "the mediocrity, the bad faith and the lies that hinder freedom of expression".
"The greatest enemies of the freedom of the press are not malicious or perverse politicians, but evil journalists in the balance of greed, blackmail and extortion," he said.
From this point of view, he was pleased that this is not the kind of journalists "neither the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador" and, rather than putting his re-election forward, "he would deepen the revolution to pursue the path and trace the right path".
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto on Paraguay within Unasur until the forthcoming elections, arguing that the organization "should stand firm and not tolerate the opportunism and attempts of disguised state coup", because in reality, "it destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
Moreover, the Ecuadorian President considers the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries through the judgment of the International Court of The Hague, which will strengthen Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty.
For the time being, this judgment is not respected.
It's a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to move forward together.
They need to be solved as a whole to get past them and go ahead.
At the same time, he expressed confidence in the correct resolution of the dispute concerning the maritime borders between Peru and Chile in the same court and stated that he was "beneficial for Latin America to refer to international forums if both countries agreed to accept such a firm judgment."
Referring to the eventuality of his presentation as a candidate for future presidential elections in Ecuador, in order to fight a third consecutive mandate, he pointed out that he saw this possibility "with much optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite difficult".
Correa assured that, if it lost the February 2013 primarys, it would withdraw from public life.
At the personal level, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unfair as Ecuador's, this socio-economic poverty can only be solved through political power.
"My political movement believed that it was me who guaranteed this possible victory but we must accept this responsibility," he said.
If I won, it would be my last presidential term and then I would withdraw from political life.
If you ever forgive us, I will, too.
"It's my decision," he said.
Correa also referred to the new medical treatment of the Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just talked to Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro and he told me that routine medical treatment was already planned and he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean a relapse from President Chávez's state of health," he commented.
The Head of State of Ecuador today participated in Lima at the VIth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) which ended with a call for better regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS-related deaths are now due to late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed as a result of the test: seropositive.
"It's like the sky fell on my head," he says, referring to the time of the announcement, that the doctor had tried to make "less painful," in vain.
The young man hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to inform himself about it and his grip was as he had just celebrated his 43th birthday.
He is, without a doubt, one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit in the Guadalajara Civil Hospital (HCG), in which he met in 1994 after many battles.
Fabrizio has lived with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something hard to imagine in the early 1990s, where there were many doubts, little choice of treatment and more stigmats.
So even the director of an IMSS clinic prevented him from telling him again "because he was voiceless".
At that time, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and have a good quality of life.
However, regardless of their disease, many people still come when the virus has already caused damage, "exhausted" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, in all cases after the first reported cases, "the great victory today is that the survival of a patient who started treatment at the right time and the survival of the population in general is exactly the same," said HCG's head of HIV unit, Jaime Andrade Villanueva and he takes as reference that this information was validated in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectiologist and HIV/AIDS expert, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS was no longer a deadly disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depended on the level of incidence of the immune system that patients presented at the time of diagnosis, with better prospects for those who do not consume drugs: up to 30 years for a CD4 rate of 200 and up to 50 years for those reaching a rate of 500 CD4.
Simply speaking, it means that for someone who would receive a positive HIV diagnosis at 25 years of age, "while he will remain under control, he will be able to live without problems up to 75 years," the scientist said.
In order to replace this progress in its context, it is necessary to know that the life expectancy of Mexicans is now 76 years on average.
While mortality has declined significantly in recent years, in Mexico, the number of deaths in the aftermath of AIDS has increased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (according to the UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that, since the onset of AIDS, 60% of patients identified on the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and 187 died until May of this year; however, we are assured that access to antiretroviral drugs has been universal since 2005.
So why are there still deaths?
I don't think the problem comes from access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's what happened in our hospital.
Over the past 12 years at least, we have never lacked drugs, the problem is that patients get to very advanced stages because they don't know they're infected, or then they learn it at advanced stages of the disease.
It gives us an indisputable fact "nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have an opportunistic infection, what it takes to have a greater impact on overall mortality, is to carry out earlier diagnoses and, for this reason, to offer mass screening tests, to all those who ask for it."
The experts and the members of the State AIDS Prevention Council of Jalisco (Coesida) agree on its proposal, as well as the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who had to do their screening test in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had done it and, despite his early age, he was already AIDS-bearer and suffered from Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you learn that you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die and want nothing to know.
"If I'm going to die, it's better that I burst out three times a week," they say, it's not my case.
The change has been beneficial, I eat well, I do exercise, I take my medication.
To date, his parents only know that he is suffering from cancer.
I have a normal life, just like anyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active sexual life, but co-responsive, I pay attention to myself and the other person," says Fabrizio, who has agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to help, thanks to his testimony, those who are afraid today, during the World AIDS Day march.
If they do the test, if they take risks, the sooner they will know if they are HIV positive and the better it will be, and if they already have the diagnosis, they need to know that we can live like everyone else, being responsible.
His message summarizes the slogan of the battle against AIDS in this year 2012.
Conservatives on the counter
There are many graves between health programs and ordinary citizens, supported Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who embraced the cause of HIV.
And the biggest one is prevention.
In all places dedicated to this, "we have actually increased the distribution of condoms, before we were given one or two, now we are giving them a hundred packets, it's very good, but it turns out, that today some still do not have access to condoms," he says.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
The question: "What are you going to do with it?", asked with sarcasm and judgments of value by social workers, guidance counselors, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that teenagers don't want to hear, says the journalist.
It proposes to redirect this ineffective distribution; that condoms should not only be sold to counters, but that they should be found in public toilet distributors and in the places where young people live.
It is not about encouraging promiscuity.
Nor was it about paying the girls and the motel, as Governor Emilio González had said when asked if there would be a distribution of condoms within his administration.
"This is not how sexuality works, it is best to provide condoms to people already sexually active," he said.
The numbers in Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The State is the 4th State of the country in number of new and accumulated AIDS cases and 13th cases for the number of HIV patients.
92% of the contamination is sexually, 6% by blood and 2% by perinatal route.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV, as for each case, there are 4 or 5 unknown individuals.
A judgment ratified in appeal by a United States court ignores the restructuring of the Vitro group's debt granted through a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico. The scenario causes an adverse precedent for all national companies with ramifications in the neighbouring country and with solvency problems.
Thus, it appears that the survival procedures of companies authorized by Mexican laws do not apply in the country to the flag of a star, contrary to international agreements.
From a practical point of view, the coup d'état delivered on 15 June last by Judge Harlin Hale of the Court of Bankruptcy for the Northern District of Texas leaves Mexican defenceless companies in the face of the possibility of embargoing their properties beyond Bravo.
However, the resolution will allow the main Mexican glass manufacturer to refer to the United States Supreme Court on the basis of three inconsistencies.
First, while the judge of the case states that creditors must register under the U.S. bankruptcy law, the fifth-circuit appeal court, in New Orleans, states that the main proceedings are the formalized commercial bankruptcy in Mexico.
The first point would involve denouncing international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of undertakings with a transnational profile.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law for International Trade Law Uniformity had been established for this purpose by taking the American Law Institute as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the inter-corporated vote, recognized in the critical mass of commercial bankruptcy, debts contracted by Vitro subsidiaries to the parent company, the majority required for the approval of the restructuring could not have been obtained.
However, Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, Vitro's case is not the first to use this plan.
Here are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Commercial Mexicana, whose debt had been secured by the Federal Institute of Commercial Bankruptcy.
Moreover, what is certain is that, since the votes of the subsidiaries remained, in all ways Vitro creditors who fought against this in the United States courts, i.e. the "vautour" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, would not have won the majority.
The vote would have been 45 to 37.
A data is omitted by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro was blamed for the difficult situation he had experienced since 2008 without stopping from the serious economic crisis faced by the United States, affecting the country's costs.
For the time being, the society of the family González Sada will appeal to the same court of appeal for the voting to take place in its entirety, i.e. with the five magistrates, since only three had voted.
The use of insurance will call for non-prosperity and require a review of the trial by a higher court, in this case the United States Supreme Court of Justice.
The most serious is that the court ignored a document sent by the Government of Mexico on behalf of the friendly curiae ("friend of the Court") detailing Vitro's proceedings under the Trade Bankruptcy Act, noting that it would release it from the conventions signed by the two countries in order to bring it to the same level as paragraph 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Act.
In addition, he pointed out that the country had aligned itself with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules laid down for cross-border insolvency cases, which ensured equity for debtors and creditors.
Carambolage of two parts: they mix Vitro and they mix the country.
General budget
The claims of the Mexican Aviation Society unions against the former employer of the company, Gastón Azcarraga Andrade, have been silent for several months, the company was accused of fraudulent administration, the Association Syndicale des Pilotes Aviadores has already encountered problems.
The court, headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has just filed a criminal application against the National Banking Commission and the Values which is accused of obstruction to justice.
According to him, the inspection authority has consistently denied that it has provided information to the Attorney General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the contractor to withdraw from F/589 of Bank IXE 198 million pesos on behalf of the Mexican Aviation Agency.
The funds were reportedly used for the purchase of shares of the Professional Hotel Administration.
As everyone knows, Azcarraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
They attend the Dragon Mars
Meeting at the weekend in an amphitheatre of the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign ecologists, university professors, entrepreneurs and members of civil society approved the creation of a broad front of opposition to the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mars in Cancun.
As you know, we are talking about a colossal centre for sale and distribution in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from the large-wall country, with a housing area for employees of 150 companies.
Previously, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of Industry and Transformation) had managed to unite the governors of the South-East region in order to oppose the monumental project that is in part on protected areas and represents the greatest threat to the industry.
ACTA's dead.
The government has put forward a Senate requirement to explain under what terms and circumstances the Ambassador of Mexico to Japan had signed the Anti-Contrafaction Commercial Agreement, known under its English acronym ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property, this theme is already of ancient history.
As everyone knows, it was a good thing that the Senate itself condemned this possibility, as it was considered an infringement of freedom of expression on social networks.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes "The basketball is my whole life"
The basketball balloon "Hetin" Reyes spent more than 60 years of his life in relation to the land and, thanks to him, traveled all over the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a knowledge of the history of local basketball as large as Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
The reason is that before a brain hemorrhage condemns him to the wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in this sport for more than 60 years, whether it is as a lower league player, player of the national basketball team, manager and leader of the national team, the NSB, with the Bayamón Vaqueros or as president of the basketball federation.
"I wore several jackets in basketball throughout my life, and even several at the same time, as when I was president of the NSB, director general of the national team and president of the federation during the 1990s," recalls Reyes during a visit of Primera Hora to Bayamón, where he has lived with Isabel, his faithful wife for over 50 years.
Basketball is my whole life.
Reyes does not exaggerate when he makes this statement.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memories that recall his route without standards, bear witness to this.
Bayamón in the heart
Of all his memories, those he loves most are those who remind him of his passage as a player in the Vaqueros team in the middle of the 1950s until 1982, after having spent 15 years as co-manager or team manager.
"This was my best years, the ones I've enjoyed most because I've had the chance to participate in eight Vacheros championships since 1967, whether as manager, co-manager or leader.
This has been a great deal of satisfaction for many years, including the five championships between 1971 and 1975.
I then retired at the 1981 championship, the year Jerome Mincy joined the NSB team.
From there, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, took the lead from the team," says Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had been in charge here and who was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me: "I have a hard player for you, it measures two meters.
Do you want it?"
That's how Mincy, one of Puerto Rico's best players started.
Bartow then recommended me Raymond Gausse, who was naturalized and was one of the best shooters.
I remember saying that if Mincy had allowed Bayamon to win a championship, Gausse was going to help us try to win another.
He was pleased with the Vaqueros championship with Gausse, but only at a distance since in 1988 he was already the great manate of the federation.
At that time, he preferred to take advantage of Mincy's and his duties on the national team.
I remember when we first won it in the United States during the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then, there was the 1990 World Cup, where we got to the 4th and we should have won the bronze medal if this Canadian judge hadn't let us play the last game, said Reyes.
Is the 1990 World Team the best national team you've ever seen?
She is one of the best, just like the one who beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympic Games.
But my favorite is that of the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and we cut the U.S. team, which was quite similar to the one that won the bronze during the World Cup.
This team was not only composed of Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), there were also the young (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to attend the world of 90 because of a problem of knees.
A team that may not have been the best in terms of individuals, but it gave us a gold medal and great joy at the Neuquén pre-Olympic tournament in Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner to replace the players suspended by the Imbroglio of the Pan American Mar del Plata Games, we won the gold against all the predictions.
What was Puerto Rico's best player?
No doubt, it's Piculín Ortiz.
Its international tournament statistics are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level as Piculín did.
And this without taking into account his trajectory in the different leagues for which he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's very hard to say.
We had a good team composed of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
In young people, I love the work that Leo Arill does.
For you, what is your greatest success in the federation?
Having been one of the most glorious times of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that in the early 1990s the NSB had up to 17 teams in one season.
What do you have to do?
There are things I would have wanted to put in place, such as the regionalization of the minor categories.
For example, Ponce's boys only play in their area and face only teams from other corners of the island during national play-offs.
Today, young people travel and play too much when this is not necessarily necessary.
I have at least seen the benefit of mandatory certifications and courses for leaders, field staff and referees.
It makes me happy.
What are you doing today?
In general, I listen to music, I watch videos from my time on YouTube, I enjoy my grandchildren and, from time to time, I attend basketball games.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me.
The death of actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth (Texas), became known worldwide for the leading role of John Ross Ewing, better known as J.R., in the television series "Dallas", in which he embodied a businessman without scruples, redoubling and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as unscrupulous oil magnet J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who had returned this year to J.R in a new season of "Dallas", died Friday evening from complications of cancer, according to a family statement sent to The Associated Press for Warner Bros., production house of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in her dear hometown of Dallas, playing again the ironic role he loved most," said the family.
Larry's family and his close friends were with him in Dallas on this Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played the role of her wife in the original series and later, was with Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital, said his press assistant, Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all those who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, loving and talented, and I'm going to miss him a lot.
"He was an exceptional person and he lived life in the background," Gray said in a press release.
The doctors had diagnosed liver cirrhosis in Larry Hagman in 1992 and recognized that he had been drinking a lot for many years.
In 1995, he was detected with a malignant liver tumor and had undergone a graft.
Several years before "Dallas", Hagman reported on television in the role of an ordinary type in the series "Jinny of My Dreams" broadcast by the channel NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In this, he took the role of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed when he discovered a seductive genius, interpreted by Barbara Eden, and brought her home.
He also played in two comedies that remained short in the antenna, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
Among his roles in the cinema are roles well received by criticism in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was thanks to his masterful interpretation of the deliciously detestable J.R. that Larry Hagman experienced his greatest success.
The dramatic series of the CBS channel on the Ewing clan and their loved ones was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "Who killed J.R.?", invented to maintain the suspense around an episode full of emotions in which the character of Hagman is almost murdered, generated speculations worldwide and millions of dollars played in bets.
Thanks to this, among other things, the series reached a record of hearing at that time.
When the response was revealed in an episode in November 1980, 41 million viewers were on average in front of their screen and made "Dallas" the second most-watched entertainment program in the world, after the final episode of "MASH" in 1983, which had gathered 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law, Kristin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. had pregnant her and then threatened to accuse her of prostitution if she did not leave the city, but other people also had reason to assault her.
Hagman played the role of Ewing as a corrupt and unsatisfied man but with charismatic smile: a dishonest entrepreneur and an unfaithful husband who was trying to internalize his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what should be like for J.R," Hagman said in 1988.
We should write, "This is the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only part he lost.
Victoria Principal, co-protagonist of the original series, remembered this Friday of Hagman as a "great man, both on the small screen and in life".
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans around the world, and in the heart of each of us, who had the chance to know and love it.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
The recording of five episodes has already been completed for the second season and a sixth is in progress, informed the chain.
For the time being, neither Warner nor the TNT channel have reported how Hagman's death will be integrated into the series.
Originally from Fort Worth in Texas, he was the son of the actress and singer Mary Martin, who met the celebrity with classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Mary Martin was still a teenager when she gave him the day in 1931 while she was married to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He took his first steps on New York theatre scenes in the early 1950s and then served in the 1952 to 1956 air force in England.
There he met the young Swedish interior decorator Maj Axelsson and married him.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for many years in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities resided.
In 2001, he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life" (in French: Hello Darlin': The unspeakable memoirs of J.R)
"I didn't write anything in this book that can hurt someone or affect him in any way," he told the press at that time.
After his liver graft, he became an active organ donation activist and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist worried patients.
"I advise them, I trust them, I come with them when they come to operate, and then," he says in 1996.
I'm trying to offer them some comfort, like, "Don't be afraid, it won't be easy for a little while, but it's going to be okay."
He was also a tobacco activist and participated in several campaigns.
A course dealing with the "End of the World" has just begun
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and climate warming.
This semester, when Stuart Charmé decided to give a course on the end of the world, he knew that he was launching an irresistible trap: the end of the "great score" of the Mayan calendar, on December 21, to which many people refer as proof of the end of the impending world.
But Professor Charmé had no idea of what awaited him in the following months: the catastrophic hurricane Sandy, a tax chauffeur that some called the "Armageddon of Debt" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christian theologians of the end of time thought the apocalypse would be triggered.
"I didn't realize that this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester I've ever known," Professor Charmé said this week to his students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey).
If we look at what happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and we reported it, it was a very good time.
And you must remember that what is bad is good for those who believe in the apocalypse.
And he is not the only teacher to teach about "the end of the world" this semester, which will, in theory, be the last of history.
In Temple, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker gives the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and climate warming.
"We analyze this because these ideas proliferate over time," he said, and the way they offer hypothetical scenarios guides some human behavior.
If the nuclear weapon fell into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could explode.
This month, students will analyze films with apocalyptic themes and study how they can be compared with examples of real life.
"I tried to inform my students about what was possible, probable, credible and impossible," Vacker said.
On the main campus of the University of State of Pennsylvania, the History Professor of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an Assistant Professor of History of Art and Anthropology, teamed up to give a course, simply called "The End of the World".
"We add "2012" to have the opportunity to give the course again, in case the world would not disappear," said Professor Restall.
Despite the "neighbourishing disaster", students must study, create projects and pass their final exams.
In the State of Pennsylvania, the final exam will be passed on the eve of the Apocalypse, leaving students no choice but to work "until the very night of the end of the supposed world," said Restall.
Courses have become quite popular.
"It was completed in two hours," Restall said about his course for high-level students, composed of 35 students.
We received e-mail messages several weeks before the beginning of the semester, from people who asked if there was still room.
Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It fascinates me to see what people are able to do to comfort each other," says Briggid Robinson, a 23-year-old sociology student from Haddonfield, New Jersey, Rutgers-Camden University.
For the fear of the Apocalypse, whether secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort, or of lack of comfort.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student in Psychology and Infirmary, claims to have seen all the apocalyptic films.
"I had never heard of a course that taught this subject," he said.
I appreciate it.
But none of the students interviewed, and even less a teacher, did not tell us to believe at the end of the world of December 21st.
"Our first project dealt with the Mayan prophecy, and in a way we have discredited it," said Julie zegle, a senior student in Temple, aged 21 and from West Chester.
The Mayas never predicted the end of the world, it's only a key date on the calendar, said Restall.
But I agree that there is anxiety related to the apocalypse in Western culture, dating back to several centuries, which makes people react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused such speculations to rise.
"In other parts of the world, people don't think about it," he says.
This is mostly the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who teaches in the Philippines this year, responded quickly when he was asked if he knew that we were taking courses here on "the end of the world".
"The Philippines do not participate at the end of the world," he replied, as if it were an exception from a higher authority.
We have a grace for the Pope.
Restall notes that over the years, we have spoken of the many supposed dates of the judgment last, and he states that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately begin to think about the next date" or philosopher about the fact that December 21 marks the beginning of a 7-year period at the end of which the world will disappear.
Students and teachers take the date lightly.
Several told us they were planning to go to "the end of the world" parties.
"Sometimes I call friends and we laugh together," said Samira Ford, 20-year-old communications student.
