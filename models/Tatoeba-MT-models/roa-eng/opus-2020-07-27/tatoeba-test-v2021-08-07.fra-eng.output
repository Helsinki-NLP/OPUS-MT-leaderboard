White pawn to f3, black pawn to e6, white pawn to g4, black lady to h4 - failure and mat! This is called by joking in the circles of chess the "mat of the mad".
The whites: turn on a1, pawn on b6, king on c8. The blacks: pins on a7 and b7, king on a8, crazy on b8. The whites put the opponent on zugzwang by playing the tower in a6, after which the blacks only have two options: take the turn on a6 or move their mad into any other box of the diagonal b8-h2. In the first case, the whites advance their pin from b6 to b7 and offer failure and mat. In the second situation, the white tower takes the black pawn on a7 with the same result.
