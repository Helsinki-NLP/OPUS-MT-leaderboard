What does it count? The ČSSD in Prague knows neither Voldemort nor the pastry
The new ČSSD councillors in the capital will have to overcome, it seems, the obvious language barriers for members of the Prague Board and the City Council to understand their renewed ODS companions.
The Aktualně.cz period "examined the members of the new Council of ČSSD to check their knowledge of the slang-marked language that has emerged in recent years in the Council, when the current members of the coalition ruled Prague.
The codified dictionary that used Prague's flower and born politics during the previous period, by Mayor Pavel Bém, includes some of the most well-known characters, situations and causes of the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it has been found that the new councillors hardly understand those well-known concepts.
At least that's what they say.
"Who's Voldemort?"
"The truth is, I don't know."
"I'm rather a novice in Prague politics," said the cultural councilman Lukaš Kaucký during the "college" terminology exam.
As for the political veteran, Karel Březina reacted equally.
They might know the concept of golf today.
"Perhaps it's the only expression of everyone you asked me that I use from time to time."
"If not, usually not slang jobs."
From the glossary, whose definitions published the newspaper Aktualně.cz last June before the ODS polling congress, the drafting chose six examples, in particular those that are especially related to the municipal authorities of Prague.
The socialists had to explain the concepts "Voldemort", "major golf hole in Prague", "go to the bakery", " bull's head", "treason of the capital" and "blindar".
Three council members agreed to submit to the test and a fourth, Antonín Weinert, who will be responsible for education in Prague in the future, initially agreed, but did not pick up the phone again.
The fifth councilman, Petr Dolínek, refused to do so directly.
"I don't get involved in these things, and I don't think I can appreciate how democratic civics have fun."
"What I do care about is how we will understand the implementation of our programs," he said.
As has been seen, Councilman Lukaš Kaucký allegedly did not realize that the previous title is an expression about an influential entrepreneur and a friend of the former mayor, Roman Janoušek.
In Kaucký the word "Voldemort" does not tell you anything; the only term that was successful in the exam is "the largest golf hole in Prague".
"It's the Blanka tunnel," says Kaucký, who adds immediately: "But rather I know it by the news."
"I'm going to have to aim for a language course," he joked.
Karel Březina is not the only one who recognizes in the golf hole the Blanka tunnel, but also the councillor of Environment Lukaš Pictureý.
Afterwards, both socio-democrats know who Voldemort and Lukaš Pictureý really know where to find that character; they also suspect the meaning of "going to the bakery".
"I think it means going to a company in Prague"; it soon reveals to Picture that it is the headquarters of the companies in Janoušek.
Like Březina, he indicates that such knowledge gained him from the news, but that he does not use such vocabulary.
According to the participants in the test, among the socio-democrats there is no glossary so familiar with colloquial terms.
"I asked my colleagues, but it really looks like we don't have anything like this."
"But among us, we use nicknames, sometimes abbreviations, or we play word games with names," says ČSSD president Praganse, Petr Hulinský, whose matchmates call Hulda.
"At school they called me Bříza, but I don't know if my colleagues also call me that," confesses their own nickname Karel Březina.
The Aktuálně.cz newspaper tested the name and it works.
For his matchmates, Weinert is Děda (similar to "yayo") or, less friendly, Dědek ("old"), the representative Miroslav Poche, with whom they associated before the misleading elections during the party's sponsorship, receives the nickname "Igráček" ("playmobil") from some of his peers.
The nicknames are also the only expressions that socio-democratic people tolerate in speech within the party.
Hulínský doesn't like to be called Hulda, but Aktuálně.cz has even discovered other apodos for this president to be preached.
"The doctor of the rights of the bitches" seems to remember that Petr Hulinský obtained his doctorate in law at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The Government wants to limit the torture of the "breds", as published in a brochure
Women considered witches in Burkina Faso share certain characteristics.
They tend to be older, they cannot work, for example, for health reasons, they are single and have no children.
The women who "return" witches are sent to an isolated area, so that they do not harm the rest of the people.
"Men rarely suffer such pain."
"It is also not isolated from healthy young women because they help in the work and have children," explains a nun who, in the capital of West African state Burkina Faso, is occupied in a special residence of more than one hundred women expelled from their communities.
The local government has decided to oppose this unusual "social measure".
It issued an information leaflet that should help to avoid witch hunting.
However, this has a glue.
"More than 70% of adults in Burkina Faso do not know how to read," warns the Standard Die newspaper on the disadvantages of written awareness.
Witchcraft charges are also common in other African countries.
In Ghana, a neighboring country in Burkina Faso, 72-year-old Ammy Hemmah died last week when three women and two men tortured her, covered her with gasoline and burned her.
The news appeared in the BBC.
The authors claim that it was due to an unfortunate accumulation of circumstances.
According to her version, the woman was caught in the oil used for ritual anointings.
It was set on fire when the group wanted to "expulse the evil spirits" of the woman.
The isolation of the "breds" supports people of all educational levels.
The newspaper Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "The devourers of human souls have always posed a danger," he said.
While in Burkina Faso the Government is trying to calm the witch hunt, in Gambia last year the president still participated in it.
"The Gambian President Jammeh, after his aunt's death, launched a widespread witch hunt that allegedly had been related to his death and tried to kill the president himself through black magic."
"To help him brought flamens from nearby Guinea who, protected by police, military officers and the personal escort of the president, were forced into force to randomly chosen men and women among the Gambian peoples to the property of the president in Kahali", says Amnesty International in his report.
On the farm, arrested people had to drink a grass poci with hallucinogenic effects that also caused their intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of the arrested didn't survive the farm stay.
After international pressure, they finally released about a thousand people arrested.
The Bakala tenant: is heated with coal stoves and sign a higher rental
The old man crossed the doors of the customer service center of the RPG Byty company of the "magnate del carbono" Zdeňek Bakala, the largest private owner of apartments for rent in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm he carried documents with the new three-storey rental contracts: his, his daughter's and his son's, who is serving his sentence.
All three have just caught the liberalization of rents.
Instead of 3,500 Czech crowns a month, the child will pay from next year 4,100 crowns for a two-room apartment with second-class separate kitchen.
"In addition, there is no hot water and heating is based on a solid fuel boiler," the man's finger shows in his son's new contract, about whose signature has full powers.
"But I signed it," explains half angry, half resigned.
The civil association BytyOKD.cz, which called the new rental conditions "inaccurate and indecent", recommends that tenants not sign the new contracts and wait until 7 December, when they publish a guide informing on how to proceed in these cases.
But, in the face of this, the man only makes a magnet.
"Every one says one thing," he says with a bad face.
Ostrava is becoming a large liberalization testing laboratory.
After New Year it will happen with the vast majority of the floors that, in the Czech Republic, were so far under a regulated rental.
Therefore, Aktualně.cz decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
The RPG's mining waiting room is one of the four of Ostrava and on Tuesday at nine o'clock, it was already full.
Right next to the doors are the security guards and next to you a number pickup machine.
"Aquiler 2011" can be read in a light button on your touch screen.
When you press it, you get out of the machine a paper with a number.
Almost doesn't give time to read "157" and already the number appears on the large screen located at the top of the room.
In a second, you're in the queue.
Shortly thereafter, an old-age marriage arrives to ask, but the crowd of the room is not here for the new rents.
Most people come to solve common problems, such as in the past: requests for settlement, insurance issues and similar issues.
Letters with the new rental contracts will arrive in Ostrava to the lodgers of most of the 44,000 apartments belonging to RPG around mid-November.
RPG Byty proposes in the letters an increase in the rent from 15 to 38%.
On 18 November a special window was opened in the customer service centre for new rents.
"It's been running for a week, so it's starting," they respond, after briefly doubting, to the workers who are in it when the client presents himself as a journalist.
Liberalization and the old floors for Bakala miners are the most delicate themes in the area.
Before the elections, the Vice-President of Parliament, originally from Ostrava, Lubomír Zaoralek, from ČSSD, has already treated them loudly and clearly and now appear continuously in the papers in the area.
"Twenty years later I want a new floor."
"They didn't change my damn bathroom plate," the man mentioned in the introduction is unhindered.
According to the workers, at the moment they are more than nothing retired to check whether they receive a discount in the rent if sign in time, as promised by the special offer of RPG.
They will also receive half of the lease discount for February the remaining tenants signing the new contract before 15 December.
However, the window of the mining "liberalization" is no doubt unable to dispel the flood of doubts.
"Of the 360 customers who were here yesterday, they only asked about the rental in 2011 about forty or fifty people," she estimates the employee of the window.
Meanwhile, RPG proposes on the web and on its boards to hold individual meetings on contracts when necessary.
If both parties do not reach agreement on the rental agreement, an independent judge should settle the matter.
"This is not a threat, but information about the only way of proceeding possible and completely in accordance with the law," says RPG on its pages.
"There is no one to judge here," says one of the employees of RPG Byty and a man who is on the street in front of the customer care center gives him at least in part the reason.
"I receive a pension of 13,000 and I have 5,000 left for food; I have no means of going to the courts," he says.
But immediately, the employee sows doubt.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaoralek warns you in the media not to sign, so maybe people are waiting," he says.
The rental regulation will cease to exist in most of the Czech Republic at the beginning of 2011 and, according to RPG Byty, its increase is an economic necessity.
"Current rents do not yet cover even the necessary amounts for the maintenance of the community fund," recalls Pavel Klimeš, director of the household portfolio of the RPG Byty company, who adds that the careless state of the community fund that angers the tenants is, for the owners, the main reason for increasing the rent.
While during the five years between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able to invest rents in apartments four billion, in the four years from 2011 to 2014, the figure will increase to 5.2 billion.
The large screen that hangs from the ceiling, opposite the seats of the waiting room, now repeats some data that highlight in red.
"The increase in rent in 2011 by 15% and less applies to 31,200 apartments, i.e. more than 90% of the GDP properties."
"In addition, it will always be up to 7.50 Czech krona monthly per square metre," is indicated on the screen.
Only 38% increase the rental of 400 floors of the RPG portfolio.
"In such cases, it is an increase from extremely low amounts, of 19,66 crowns per square metre," says RPG.
On 2,600 floors, the rental will remain invariable next year.
RPG Byty promises that liberalization will not impact rents, but will scale from four to eight years.
In addition, it adds the following commitment: the company will invest all the money from the rise of the rent (see the chart) back on the floors, mainly in heating savings: new windows and heating.
Priority will be given to those who sign the upward rental agreement.
Architects have understood that offices also need childcare
The Avriopoint administrative building in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design.
No one would say that he also hides inside a small nursery with all of his own to such facilities: walls of colors, creative furniture and even a miniature park on the outside terrace.
Since October last year, the children of the employees of Arch.Design can come to her.
The architectural project company Arch.Design, whose studio came out numerous well-known buildings in Brno, thought from the first sketches of the Avriopoint building to include a space for its mini-guard.
About 90 people work in the company, mainly at the age of the baby boom and wanted to allow architects and designers to return to work soon after maternity.
Along with the possibility of enjoying a reduced schedule, the nursery is one of the benefits that Arch.Design to his workers in the framework of his social program.
Constructors and architects in this way have the possibility of combining a demanding profession with the care of children.
The mini-guard was an idea of the employees themselves of Arch.Designu and, with the support of the management, managed to obtain funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company's mini-guard is financed through the European Social Fund under the Operational Programme on Human Resources and Employment, as well as the Czech State budget.
Thanks to funding (an allocation of more than 2.8 million Czech krona) they were able to purchase the equipment and, after two years, to hire qualified personnel and services.
When the financing is exhausted (two years), Arch.Design is obliged to maintain the mini-guardia with its own funds for three years.
The preparation of the project lasted one year and in the submission of the request for funding contributed the Economy Rating company.
The care of children is in the hands of qualified staff; moreover, a nurse and a teacher of the Ministry of Education are present all day, and the nursery is currently home to children with no age limit, although most of them are less than three years old.
Since this is a "mini-garde", it can only receive a maximum of five children simultaneously, even if the shifts are more during the day.
The operation of the nursery is flexible to adapt to the needs of parents and children of all workers have the same right to use the nursery, regardless of the hierarchy within the company.
Although this is individual education and care, the contents of the mini-guards programme are comparable to the usual pre-school education programme.
In it children not only play, but also receive quality education: from basic learning to preparation for school, they teach up to English.
The class has not only toys and table games, but also a computer for children.
The presence of young children in the company itself creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can go to see their children at any time and avoid the stress of picking up school children late when they are away from their workplace.
Thus, parents are more productive while working.
It is not surprising that this naturally generates a relationship of loyalty between the worker and his employer.
In this way, Arch.Design is among the sign companies that offer a great advantage for the admission of new workers: they support the family and, ultimately, this program reinforced the marketing of staff.
The bone house remains fascinating after 100 years. Watch Gaudí's interiors
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs remind the column of a dinosaur and the balconies look like the mouth of an open fish.
This is the Casa Batlló, in Barcelona, of the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
Because of its shape similar to a skeleton, the locals nicknamed it "the house of the bones".
Its organic forms, its striking colors, the innovative use of stone, the fragments of tiles and mosaics, a facade that reminds the scales and omnipresent lines gently curved, all of this is typical of the secession of Antoni Gaudí.
The cover of the house plays with dream lines, delicate colors and textures taken from nature and fauna.
By paying more attention, a certain geometry, rhythm, and order is observed carefully.
At night, the entire facade of the house seems even more impressive, as it is illuminated in such a way that the brightness of the colors is improved.
Serpentia and the twist of forms continue to surprise us also inside.
The corrugated wood copies the frames of the windows, the rails, the ornaments of the doors, the mirrors and the signs.
The Casa Batlló, which is located in Eixample district in number 43 of the lively shopping street of Passeig de Gràcia, arose from the refurbishment of a house in the year 1877 of architect Emilio Sala Cortés.
The reconstruction lasted two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrial Josep Batlló, initially insisted on overthrowing the former building and starting from scratch, but soon accepted Gaudí's idea of a new and cheaper reconstruction.
However, the Casa Batlló, made up of several apartments, did not draw Antoni Gaudí alone.
In the design, architect Josep María Jujol collaborated.
In fact, in their plans of the project there were ornaments for the apartment representative of the owner of the property and the mosaics used on the facade.
In the facade also workers other creators and artists.
The collaboration in the proposals of Casa Batlló was the beginning of Jujol's successful collaboration with Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of the House Milan and the Park Güell of Gaudí, in which there are other pieces of it.
Because of its organic form, the locals soon after its completion nicknamed it "the house of the bones".
Others, due to the specific window opening mechanism, began to call it the "house of the woods".
It is also said that, at the height of the construction, appears the sword of San Jorge, patron of Catalonia.
Other sculptural elements of construction hide religious motives.
Gaudí designed in the house a unique system for the central heating season with ventilation vents and typical fireplaces.
It may seem strange its inclination of forty-five degrees.
During the construction, Gaudí completely failed to respect the construction standards of the moment and was not influenced by them.
Even so, the construction had obtained the corresponding permit from the beginning, although, of course, the data indicated on the planned reconstruction were so vague that, two years later, at its completion, the city council was so impacted by the result that it requested correction.
He was upset, for example, that the construction included columns even to the public sidewalk.
The arrangements were never made, rather on the contrary: only fifteen days after the request for the city council, Josep Batlló requested (and obtained) permission to rent the two highest floors of the building.
On the lower floors the owner himself was installed.
In the gallery of the second floor there was the living room and on the third floor the bedrooms and the private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The house, with six floors, is completely crossed by a staircase that leads to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of the reform consisted of breaking all the angles and straight lines, covering them with curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of space connection.
The common part can be connected completely by opening the doors of the salons and a larger group can communicate in this way without problems, without giving up the privacy necessary for more intimate conversations.
The house, with Gaudí's reconstruction, won not only a new facade, but also an unusual roof and two additional floors.
It is also impressive how Gaudí plays with light, white and blue tiles that cover the inner courtyard and swallows.
The game with the two colors brings the maximum light on all the floors of the house.
It was based simply on the principle that white reflects more light than dark colors, which, on the contrary, absorb sunlight.
Anyone can visit Casa Batlló, which in 2005 was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and recharged apartment of the accessible to the public.
The owners decided to open the doors to the public in 2002, on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
With the visits, they confirmed, or discovered, that it was a very beneficial business and expanded the visits to the common area and the buhardilla, including the roof terrace.
The price of entry to the monument is not insignificant, it reaches 16.50 euros, although students, retirees and tourist card holders get 20% discount.
The amount considerably exceeds the entry price of other Gaudí constructions in the city.
If you want to enjoy the real atmosphere of the bed with your lagarto towers, you should quickly become friends with some resident of the neighboring houses and visit you at home.
How mattress and somier are chosen: women and men seek different things
Nothing of a pompous frame for the bed; what really confers its quality to a good bed is the surface to lie down, that is, the mattress and the dreamer.
First of all, they must be complemented by perfection in order to adapt to specific users.
Many elements, including weight, height, health status, and owner's sex, come into play during the election.
Also important is the type of interior in which mattress and somier are placed.
A typical example?
For example, in a weekend cabin that does not usually have heating, latex mattresses should not be used because they "heat" more slowly.
Moreover, they often weigh considerably more than usual polyurethane mattresses.
It is therefore necessary to turn them around more frequently.
If the canals of the center are not properly aired and above, they are on a firm basis, they keep the moisture inside.
When choosing a bed, customs also influence.
Those who have spent a lot of time abroad often use a very high mattress with a soft layer and will have problems feeling good on a lower and harder surface.
"Almost all hockey players returning from the NHL complained that they didn't sleep here as well."
"For their bruised shoulders, heels and hips they needed mattresses with a soft layer of viscoelastics."
"This type of mattresses are also recommended for people with diabetes who have long problems with the nervous system, so they get poorly information about the joints and the skin," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in the furniture covered.
Many hockey players, like other customers, have been preferring viscoelastic mattresses for a long time.
"Today there is no problem, because they have these suitable Tempor and the Italian Magniflex, but also the Czech brand Tropico."
You don't have to be a NHL player to appreciate viscoelastics anymore.
This "miracle" works in a very simple way.
Optimize your stiffness and form depending on the heat absorbed or adapts to your body heat.
Nothing exerts pressure; during the night, it will not turn like after a hard game.
Just sleep better.
The viscoelastics also works as a protection against the lakes.
When choosing the size of the mattress, add the length of your feet to its height, i.e., between 21 and 34 cm.
A man or woman with a height of about 180 cm will need a bed of between 210 and 220 cm.
The minimum width for a person should be, in a double room, 90 cm, in total 180 cm.
In the case of single rooms, e.g. single rooms, it is recommended at least between 120 and 140 cm.
For a possible visit to be also comfortable.
"If not, you can apply a simple rule to calculate the width: when falling face up, you should have your hands comfortably cuddled towards the elbows," advises engineer Helena Prokopová, expert at Cechu čalouníků to dekorater, who has been dealing for many years with the problem of healthy sleep and ergonomics of furniture, a subject that teaches in specialized schools.
In the double rooms, each needs its own somier and mattress, so during the purchase you must pay attention to combine the height of mattresses.
Otherwise, it will be necessary to mount the somières at different heights, which is not always possible in all beds.
The foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, models with a spring interior of a minimum of 15 cm, of which at least three cm are for the layer that adapts to the shapes and softness.
"By touching it with your hand or by settling on the mattress, no doubt the docks should not be noticed," says Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a particular type of sleeper.
The bedrooms completely cushioned, in which the mattress and base are like siameses, make no sense in the bedroom.
The mattresses breathe poorly and cannot be washed, which is often done today.
And since every night we sweat between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sweat, it is clear that after about five or seven years the mattress will begin to remind us of a large (and congested) tamiz.
For this reason, experts reject slogans that speak of a mattress life of up to 25 years or, even, a life assurance.
However, everything has one but.
Therefore, the sellers give advice: on mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm, take care of the cleaning and washing of the deck, but better add a mattress protector that can be easily removed and washed.
Although mattress covers are currently manufactured with zipper closures throughout their perimeter, so by opening them they remain in two parts (something very important for washing and the size of the washing machine!), their manipulation in the larger models (and for one person) when lifting the mattress may seem like a fight between a fly weight and a heavy weight.
In bed, instead of a dreamer, do you have a firm table?
Never!
As much for the beds thought to spend one night the visits.
However, you should make (if you don't already have them) ventilation holes on the table and be used with a mattress with springs inside and a minimum height of 15 cm with the springs in bags (such as the German Taschenfederkern) and a soft layer.
Polyurethane mattresses should not be used on such bases.
For non-artinable sheets with between 14 and 18 sheets, latex mattresses or sandwich mattresses (e.g. a combination of latex and coconut fiber) can be used, although it is always better a dream with a greater number of sheets, 28 or more, in which the sheets of the lumbar area are reinforced and their rigidity can be regulated.
Artificial blades should not be used with a spring mattress, since they do not react to reclination.
In addition to the rigidity adjustment of the blades, the shoulder protection can also be used.
It is a special fixation of the sheets that allows to press or even tilt the sheets in such a way that they "rode" perfectly to the shoulders during the sleep.
For men who have very wide shoulders, it is something very important.
They even remember the mattress manufacturers who, in the "male", began to use a softer area just around the shoulders.
They also remember women, for whom they place a softer area around the hips.
For the most demanding customers, there are somières with a cross structure or boards with the so-called multitorsion damping.
Pressure is distributed between different points and tension is lowered.
It should also take into account that, even if you use the right mattress and somier, if you use a bad pillow (large and "soft"), most of the advantages will disappear.
The basic standard is simple: the pillow must hold the head and the corners can only reach the shoulders, so that the muscles of the pillows can be relaxed.
The right recommended size is 50 x 60 cm, something normal for example in Scandinavia.
When lying on the side, the pillow should be on the same level (when combined with the somier with shoulder reinforcement or the softest area of the mattress) as the shoulder height.
Modern mattresses have something to do, it seems, with original mattresses filled with straw.
Manufacturers continue to use, increasingly, natural materials or, at least, mixtures.
In fact, biological mattresses are fashionable.
Oil-based raw materials, with which polyurethane foam is manufactured, are filled with natural oils, such as rice or soya.
In fact, practically all known manufacturers use soya.
"Biological, in the case of mattresses, means that the center is manufactured only from materials of natural origin," explains Petr Vašíček of the company Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used during the manufacture of the mattress bed, one of the first aloe vera.
But you can also choose from the microcapsules, which release a fresh aroma to the forest or lavender.
There are also differences for men and women.
While men "refresh" themselves with extracts of breeze, so that the mattress bed absorbs heat and refreshes the body, women prefer to "heat" the bed.
The red pepper extract improves the circulation of the blood, so that women feel more warm.
The current favorites?
The mattresses made of cold foam, which are more porous, with a structure of adapted cells, making them more permeable than those of normal polyurethane and offer more permeability.
The combination of various cold and viscoelastic foam stiffness allows to manufacture mattresses from various areas that know perfectly where the head, shoulders and heels go.
A good-quality mattress will cost you seven thousand crowns up.
Those who perform a therapeutic function usually have lower VAT, as they are considered health means.
The first one to gain this advantage in the Czech Republic was Gumotex.
It is difficult to save on mattresses and somières.
At times, offers from manufacturers or sellers may be approved, which sometimes offer two mattresses for one's price.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers Duofreeez mattresses with a foam with memory memory attached to the bottom by 11,990 crowns.
The second is obtained free of charge.
The era of viscoelastics with an open cell structure and a great density began with Temper's "cosmic" material.
Initially it emerged as a material for NASA, because during the astronaut loas takeoffs they were subjected to a huge overload.
Temper softens with heat and hardens with cold.
Therefore, the human body, warm, has a perfect effect and optimally adapts its pressure.
It is therefore ideal to prevent soaks from occurring, but also to improve comfort during sleep.
The viscoelastic foam is used not only on mattresses but also for sanitary products, for example for pillows placed under the legs and relieve them, as well as their circulation.
National manufacturers, for example, use Eucatherm C or Twinsaver foam and similar.
More and more parents use people monitoring devices to control their children
Fear of children leads more and more people to think about controlling them by GPS.
The system, initially designed for the monitoring of vehicles, can also follow the movement of people and thus contribute, for example, in case of the disappearance of the nine-year-old Anička Janatková girl.
For the moment the device has the approximate size of a set of bezels, but it will soon be reduced to the size of a watch.
Many people were afraid of the missing Anička case and began to report on the means available to better protect their children.
Even at the expense of invading your privacy.
"We are all trying to tell ourselves that it is not about spying, but another way to reduce the chances of a tragedy," considers Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of tracking devices in the Czech market.
"I recognize that in certain cases such devices can be abused, for example if they get into someone's pocket without their knowledge, but we have not yet met with such cases."
"Most customers actually buy it for security reasons," adds Pilin.
In their view, children should always know what the "cajita" is for and how it is used in the event of an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bočková warns about the fact that if the child does not want to take it, he will just throw it away.
"Even younger children show great creativity when intentionally losing certain things if they want to avoid being controlled."
"Before, parents relied heavily on mobile phones, but these could be turned off as easily as the tracking device," Bočková says.
In your opinion, it is questionable whether in case of attack such a device is really useful.
"If it is a prepared kidnapping, the author will almost always check whether the child wears some kind of electronic device that can reveal his location."
"Now it's the phone."
"As the use of tracking devices is expanding, it will also search for them, as their sale will no doubt be made with much publicity."
"In such cases, criminals always go one step ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
However, he adds that such devices can help in the case of an improvised pedophile attack.
According to Robert Čech of the company RC Monitoring, which provides tracking services for both vehicles and people, even if, after an attack, the tracking device is immediately destroyed, its presence can help.
"The device can be configured to send the position regularly after a certain period."
"If you suffer damage, at least you will facilitate the last position of the person in question."
"The most expensive devices have integrated a tilt meter, so if the person simply slips and remains motionless, the device will immediately issue a warning with the position in question," says Čech.
In your opinion, a service of this type can be obtained even with smart mobile phones with navigation, in which only special software should be installed.
The problem with the current tracking units is that they are devices with a size similar to a pair of cerillas or smaller mobile phones at the moment.
Therefore, they may be lost.
According to Pilin de Macro Weil, for that reason testing is currently being carried out with devices that look like a digital clock.
"In addition, they will have the added advantage that a possible aggressor may not identify the device."
"Or identify it after some time, which can make the police gain time," he adds.
Although tracking devices are carried into the wrist or hanging, they will continue to use the same technology used for tracking vehicles.
This is the location check with a GPS system (which is used in the usual navigation in the car) combined with the function of a mobile phone that communicates the current position.
The army has enough wicks to surround all Chequia. But it only lasts two years
The Czech army bought 445 kilometers of mash to arrest explosives.
Last year the Ministry of Defence added to its arsenal 224 kilometres of mecha.
Therefore, they have stocks for 225 years.
The problem is that the wick's life is two years, four to the top.
The army bought the explosive wick from the STV Group, a.s. for forty million crowns.
The staff of the General responded to MF DNES by justifying the purchase of such a huge amount of moose saying that the soldiers need for training exercises 60 kilometers per metre per year.
According to the military pyrotechnic calculations, with which MF DNES was contacted, it is decided that, in such a case, such manoeuvres should be carried out with frequent use of explosives each year as well as all generals, senior officers, and even secretaries and cleaners.
They did not want to be exempt, nor did the Minister of Defence Alexandr Vondr and the captain of the Vlastimil Picek army.
Only then could it be justified for the army to spend 60 kilometres of mash.
This length is equivalent to 25,000 explosions.
Even so, the army would have sufficient stocks for more than ten years.
If, on the contrary, as the experts say, for the initial training of each new professional reaches a maximum of two metres, the army would have with the new purchase (even by adding the consumption of the units of engineers or specials) sufficient stocks for the 225 indicated above.
The soldiers of the rapid-intervention brigade complained personally recently to Minister Vondra because they say they have little ammunition for various weapons, so even shooting practices for money are restricted.
And let's not talk about the lack of underwear.
"I don't get to understand that he repeatedly buys us such quantities of mecha."
"But it's your decision and they'll no doubt know why they act like that."
"For us, the army is a good customer to whom, as a company, we try to satisfy," says the commercial director of STV Group, Jan Děcký.
The Ministry of Defence spokesman Jan Pejšek defends the hundreds of miles of mecha also saying that he will have stocks of this "munition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký, from STV Group, indicates that the wick only has a useful life of four years and, in the case of pyrotechnic products for the military or the police, of two years.
"If it is stored in perfect conditions, it can last up to four," says one of the soldiers who, because of the possible criticisms of the army, does not want to give his name.
After the end of their useful life, each ammunition must be carefully checked to see if it remains reliable and will not harm the soldiers.
But these tests are not free and require additional investment.
Another argument by the Ministry is that when he bought 445 kilometers of mash, he obtained a discount.
"It cost us 60% less than last year's order of 244 kilometers," says the spokesperson Pejšek of the Ministry of Defence's shopping centre.
Just to compare: the annual mecha consumption of police pyrotechnics, which eliminate the ammunition of the Second World War or left by the Soviet army, has not been more than 1,500 metres for years.
In addition, the police always ask only the fair amount to exhaust the ammunition before the end of their useful life.
It was decided for safety reasons for pyrotechnics and, moreover, in the meantime, it is possible to obtain more modern and reliable types of wick.
The Ministry already has clear difficulties in completing tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Pact era, when the Czechoslovak army of two hundred thousand people was preparing for a campaign in the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnics he spoke to MF DNES, after a couple of years there will be the following problem with the current: hundreds of miles of old wick will have to be removed, which is now being purchased "barrace".
So far I am still living from the contacts I got thanks to the competition
Wining the "Entrepreneur of the Year" contest helped Lukaš Pytloun to sell the franchises of his hotel.
In the last edition, the 28-year-old entrepreneur Lukaš Pytloun from Liberec won the "Entrepresario of the Year" contest.
His success story seems to be taken from a film.
Lukaš Pytloun loved traveling.
Foreigners realized that in Liberec, quality accommodation was needed at a good price.
With the savings I met with seasonal jobs abroad and a bank credit bought a house that was half-drunk with five floors.
Considering that he was still studying his third year at the university, he was really brave.
"At present, the quality-price ratio of the accommodation in our area moved me to do something about it," says Lukaš Pytloun.
He started renting the first reconstructed apartment to foreign workers.
All the income that the investment earned back in the building, which gradually became a pension of 54 rooms.
Since then, in seven years in the business, he gradually managed to open four pensions in Liberec, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of about 300 in all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of all was, until recently, the four star design hotel Pytloun.
However, this year he opened another of the same quality.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov or Tise, to which we have sold our concept of franchise, and others are showing interest in a franchise of Pytloun," the entrepreneur said number one last year.
"To this sale of licenses for opening hotels greatly helped to win the 'Empressant of the Year' competition," says Pytloun.
The victory increased its fame and popularity both in Liberec and in the surroundings.
"People recognized me on the street, they still often congratulated me and, I must say, it was very nice," he recalls.
It certainly recommends that everyone try a company that participates in the contest.
But it considers that it is not necessary to win, but that participation is already beneficial.
He claims that so far he continues to live from the contacts and acquaintances that, without the competition, he may not have obtained.
"With some people I met thanks to the competition I have started to collaborate regularly."
The reputation associated with success, in his opinion, also included employees,
in total, around seventy.
"I have seen that they show greater loyalty and are proud to participate in something that gained general recognition."
"It is not, much less, my own personal success, but it is the result of the hard work of the entire team."
"It is only my name that appears in the foreground," Lukaš Pytloun says modestly today.
I wish my successor a year quieter than we had in Farmet
The euphoria for victory soon dissipated from the impact of the crisis.
Thanks to the hard work of the winner, Farmet may have already passed the worst.
The owner of the company Farmet, Karel Ž -árský, received the first prize in the last edition of the Vodafone competition "The year's company", last year at the "Eslava House" in Prague.
The jury valued his efforts, with which he managed to turn a small technical workshop into Česká Skalice into a firm with a turnover of hundreds of millions.
"I can say that the prize not only encouraged me, but all my collaborators and improved our confidence to fight competition," said the winner last year.
The history of the Farmet company begins with the desire to do something useful.
Therefore, when the State proposed to Karel's father the rent of a small workshop as compensation for the property embargo during communism, he did not doubt too much; he gave up his position in the company where he worked and, with a couple of colleagues, founded the company with his father of plastic batteries.
Shortly thereafter, they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
Eight years later they became the largest automatic press manufacturer in central Europe.
They also gained a greater presence among the non-specialised public after achieving success in the media competition.
"Not only did our customers begin to regard the Farmet brand as considerably better, but foreign partners also began to value the collaboration with a company that gained greater success in their country," says Karel Ž -árský.
Last year perhaps it wasn't in Farmet just a sample of the euphoria of victory.
It was also recognized by the trade results until 2008 and partly from 2009.
And just the year 2009 was the hardest year to sell machinery.
The worsening crisis, which had not yet reached so many citizens, caused companies to halt their investment projects and began to limit the purchase of new machines or technologies.
"We, of course, are not free of such a situation."
"The revenues were reduced by 40%, we had to limit production and even had some layoffs," explains Karel Ž -árský.
A viable company must sometimes take even unpopular measures.
However, they controlled the situation and maintained the profits of the company, although it was at lower levels than before the crisis.
Nevertheless, where Farmet did not cut expenses was in research and development.
"With the subsidies we have built a research and training centre, we strengthen the presence on the international market and we have obtained excellent valuations at national fairs," says Ž -árský.
Everything indicates they've already left the crisis behind.
Income increases again and, with it, the number of new employees.
"The new achievement expects it to bring a feeling of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere," says Karel Ž  theárský.
A survey revealing ridiculous rules
The Absurdez survey of the year is part of the business tournament for the fourth time.
It has already succeeded in eliminating some ridiculous rules.
The unknown winner of the new edition of the Absurdez survey of the year was the obligation to bring to the administration documents to which officials can access online.
The decision was adopted by more than one third of the almost four thousand voters.
For example, the social security administration asked for an extract from the commercial register, although its officials could obtain it with two mouse movements.
Thanks to the survey, this has changed.
"The Czech administration of social security will no longer ask for an extract from the commercial registration when carrying out a check on the insured's taxes," said ČSSZ spokesman Jana Buraňová.
The aim of the Survey of Absurdity of the Year is to consult the rules and regulations to be respected by companies and entrepreneurs in Chechnya and to try to eliminate those who are absurd.
This year forms for the fourth time part of the business tournament of the publication Hospodářské noviny and begins to create affection also among the general public.
While last year's edition included the participation of 3,000 voters, this year practically reached the four thousand.
And it's not surprising, since we still have several remaining legal obligations to be respected simply to trade.
"Perhaps in number of papers necessary for the tax declaration we are in the first world," says Karel Havlíček of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and of Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
For years, simplification of business standards has been a stated goal of all Governments.
However, compared to the rest of the world, the situation of improvement especially in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, from the point of view of the conditions for having a company, Czechia is in position 74a, i.e. eight posts worse than last year.
The Absurdez competition for the year was held for the first time in 2006 and is repeated every year in the same way.
Anyone can indicate some administrative or bureaucratic absurdity each year between April and the end of September, when the contest is closed.
The proposals can be made on the website www.firmaroku.cz. Afterwards, the contest organizer chooses seven candidates for the "anti-premium" and, during October, allows the public to vote on the Internet via www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
He gains the absurdity he receives more votes.
For the survey this year, more than one hundred were submitted, in particular 105 rules and regulations that do not make sense.
The examples were sent by both entrepreneurs and professional associations and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the competition was, for example, the requirement that vehicles for the maintenance of roads and highways pay the toll or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two bathrooms paint every two years the walls.
The list of the 70 proposals for this year is published on the page of the competition.
The announcement of the competition, which is always held at the beginning of November in Wenceslao square in Prague, is part of an event in which people of the political and social world usually participate.
This year, for example, attended the event of Eva Svobodová, director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic, or Petr Kužel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Republic.
"The economic prosperity cannot be maintained if the state continually hinders employers, so my objective is to eliminate every year a minimum of thirty paragraphs that currently complicate trade unnecessarily," announced Minister of Industry and Commerce Martin Kocourek.
Efforts to eliminate absurd regulations are not left in rubber water.
In 2007, what bothered people most was the employer's obligation to communicate three days in advance to the business office of the permanent operating area, with the intention of reaching a job at a fair or exhibition.
This obligation was abolished in the new industrial law.
The obligation which ended second in number of votes in 2007, i.e. communication to the office by its foreign workers of work travel of up to 30 days, was removed in the law of the so-called green card.
And the third one's going to beat her.
The 2009 Absurdez was the regulation for physiotherapists to have in their consultation a large mirror, a refrigerator and two soil scales.
Therefore, this year the Ministry of Health issued a communication saying that it had eliminated the obligation to have a refrigerator.
A new category recognizes socially responsible enterprises
Ecological, humanitarian, educational or sports projects are valued.
The novelty in this fifth edition of the Hospodářské Noviny competition is the category called Company responsible for 2010.
The task of this competition is to support responsible and fair companies.
"In this way we want to support companies that deal with the impact of their activity on the environment and support socially responsible activities," says Patrik Bartholdy, Regional Director of the Vodafone Mobile Operator, the organizer and sponsor of the competition, as in the case of the Rebel competition of the year.
For this new special subcategory of this year's edition of the Vodafone Company's main contest of 2010 companies were presented for which commercial success is not the only long-term objective.
The story of each of them is inspiring and would allow us to write an independent article.
Although the type of activities varies completely between the two, the common denominator is the support and consideration they offer.
In one case, for example, disabled persons, in other cases the personal or health problems of employees.
Among the fourteen finalists of the entire Republic, for example, the Spanish software company Et Netera, which supports the formation of informal sports teams among its workers, who then participate in various sports tournaments.
Another example of the company responsible for the Pardubice area is the Isolit-Bravo company, which has been the main sponsor of disabled children for seven years.
In Poděbrad, there is a paper that is particularly concerned about the health problems of its workers, since they account for more than 70% of the staff; that is why he received the title of Company responsible for the central area of Chequia and in the Vodafone Company competition of the year ended third in the region.
In Olomouc he won the accountancy company MiRyz Soft, which reduced the working hours, even below the average of 35 hours per week, without reducing wages.
The title was also awarded because it buys Czech manufacturers priority, supports community activities in the area and respects the environment.
"We try to recycle as much as possible for our production and administration activities to produce as little impact as possible on the environment," explains Miluše Ryznarová.
The head of IT Enlogit company in the Ústí region also thinks about the health of its employees and, with each laptop, offered them an ergonomic chair and keyboards; it also supports the work from home and its business events using catering services from a local protected company.
"In addition, we support the People's Fellowship in distress, which specifically helps the local Roma community," says Ondřej Suchý's representative.
The Praní laundering company in the Karlovy Vary region, whose employees receive bonuses in a special way that affects their pension funds, is also well placed with mention.
"We give benefits in food, transportation, improvement of qualifications and leisure," says Josef Strapáč of the construction company Bruntàl Czasch, winner in the Moravia-Silesia region.
In the category of Company responsible for the year, all the regional finalists of the Vodafone Company contest of the year were automatically assigned to answer the questions of the registration form and sent it to the organizers before 15 August.
The organizers removed from the evaluation forms that were not complete or wrong.
"If the representatives of the competing companies did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the Company responsible competition of the year, but are not disqualified from the Vodafone Company of the year "principal" contest."
"Individual applications for this competition are not allowed, since this is a subcategory of the company's main competition of the year," explains Karel Goldman of the Bison & Rose consultancy.
Police arrested during a public auction in the Agricultural Fund building in Pilsen
The Anti-Corruption Police conducted several arrests in the Agricultural Fund building in recent days.
The detectives reported to a local entrepreneur in the media sector and to the real estate entrepreneur Luboš G.
It seems that this attempt to manipulate an ongoing public auction for the restitution of rights in such a way that the underground receives it with a precise interest.
He was supposed to pay Luboš G. half a million crowns for it.
"At the moment I can only say that the police are looking for a person for bribe during a public auction and public bidding," Právo told Právo the head of the Attorney General of Pilsen Antonie Zelená, adding that for the time being he cannot disclose more details about the ongoing investigation.
After twenty-four hours, the police released the 46-year-old entrepreneur.
On how it could influence the public auction, given the little official information, it can only be speculated.
The spokesman for the Lubomíra Černá Agricultural Fund responded to Právo's questions saying that the police actually carried out the arrest at Pilsen's headquarters and was during a public auction.
"It's a client, not one of our workers," he said.
According to Černá, the public auction is called "A call for proposals for land transfer in accordance with the land law" and is carried out when several stakeholders appear in relation to the offered land.
"These persons, during the summons, offer a higher value than their restitution, which must be transferred before the value of the land is announced."
"According to the offers, the order of the buyers is determined, and then the Agricultural Fund transfers the land to the person offering the largest offer," the Fund spokesperson explained.
Luboš G. had information on who was to be summoned and, as he was also interested in acquiring various rights of restitution, he proposed to interested parties on the ground that he would not participate in the auction.
Please, he was taking a commission.
This would explain that, at the time of the arrest, there was so much money on it.
Luboš G. had special contacts in the Pilsen Fund for a long time.
It was in the case of the former head of PF Václav Sankot, who was accused of dispatching the replacement of land for which a construction decision had already been issued.
For example, Luboš G. has just obtained land from the Fund for the construction of public infrastructure, in particular at the place where a large road should be built in the industrial area of Borská pole.
Later, they were changed in a very beneficial way with the magistrate by a house in the very historic center of the city with a much higher value.
In this case, the town council had to intervene because, otherwise, blocked land would prevent construction.
Families must pay additional costs of several hundred crowns per month
Households will have to pay from January not only for all types of energy, but also for water and electricity, heating supplements and, in some cases, higher rents.
Consequently, families will have to take several hundred crowns out of the portfolio from January to the month more than now.
The electricity price is rising by 4.6%, the gas is around 2%, some cities have to pay up to 10% more for water supply and many also increase the price of central heating.
The rise in electricity for families living in apartments should be about 100 crowns a year more than now.
The main electricity suppliers, however, reduced prices, as it has increased support for the production of renewable energy sources, in particular photovoltaics.
However, the gas is moderate, especially when heating is most used and therefore the consumption is higher.
In this case, they must also have a couple of hundred crowns plus a year.
While electricity and gas are growing across the country, the central heating price changes vary from place to place.
The increase in prices is mainly planned by the largest municipality.
For example, the households of Pardubice or Hradec Králové will pay from January for central heating about 50 more krona per month, while the families of Liberec will pay more than 1,000 additional krona per year.
Residents in Prague must also bear a 9 per cent increase in the price of water and heating, especially in the event that the city increases the rental of infrastructure.
If the rent does not vary, the pragans will pay 6.8% additional.
Prices in Prague, however, will remain among the lowest in the country.
In northern Bohemia, where current prices are among the highest, both rates will rise by 7.4%.
The rent prices of 450,000 rents can be considerably increased in Prague, where the regulation will end in January.
For example, CPI Byty, which owns Ústí nad Labem about 2,500 floors, will increase the rent from January to 100%.
The company shall bring to the courts those who do not agree with the new rent.
Regular rents, which benefit residents of about 300,000 floors, could increase the coming year to 10%.
The young Czechs get drunk with Fernet and rum. The beer is no longer in a way, because it takes effect slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka and even good whiskeys stolen from their parents.
These are the beverages that cause them to end up in medical care young drinkers under the age of fifteen.
Children who end up lying in the hospital continuously to overcome the hangover are no longer an exception.
This is derived from the experience of doctors who are faced with such cases in pediatric admissions of the hospital.
"Bever beer or wine is no longer in fashion, because it takes a long time to get drunk."
"Holiday is now the strong alcoholic drinks," says Právo, head of pediatrics at Hořovice Hospital in central Bohemia, Luděk Pelikán.
"When they get a bottle to their father from the lagoon, it can be whiskey, but it's usually Fernet and vodka."
"The vodka has the advantage of being light with juice and it doesn't smell so much," he explains.
It is also confirmed by the spokesman for Motol University Hospital, Eva Jurinová.
"Normally, it's usually Fernet or rum."
"These are modern alcoholic beverages, particularly among schoolchildren."
"In some cases, they use waiting they caught at home," Jurinová adds.
According to Chief Pelikán, 13-year-old drinkers and 14-year-olds appear in hospitals.
Before Hořovice, where he has worked since this year, worked for a decade in the pediatrics in Motol, where ambulances took young people from nearby areas.
"A girl had to come in maybe four times."
"It started at the age of 12, when they brought it with 3.5 alcohol in blood, in addition to a mixture with ecstasy," says the department doctor on this case.
"He was at Holešovice's fair at some dance party."
"The interesting thing is that his mother didn't even surprise him that his daughter had disappeared 48 hours," the boss was surprised.
It is precisely the lack of parental interest or even their clear tolerance to drink on the part of their children that is considered the main cause of increased alcohol consumption among young people.
Experts point out that, in the case of children, dependence cannot be properly spoken of.
"Alcoholic means a person who has a chronic alcohol dependence for several years, with all the phenomena associated with alcohol, which does not occur in children."
"In those who drink alcohol repeatedly, rather it is due to a systematically failed social or family environment," says Chief Pelikán.
According to the spokesman Jurinová, this year at Motol's pediatric clinic, forty drunk children were hospitalized until mid-November.
However, statistics show only those who come from serious poisoning and should remain in the hospital.
Young drinkers who, after medical examination, go home with their parents or with the police, don't count.
In addition to the cases where children simply meet after school and drink eagerly, for Pelikán there are three seasonal elevations to mention: the day of witches, the end of the year and the end of the school course.
"In such circumstances, they drink by bad grades or, on the contrary, celebrate the start of holidays."
"On the day of the witches I have come to see in admissions up to seven drunk children at once," adds Pelikán.
Drinkers who spend the night in detoxification under the supervision of doctors, paradoxically, have the advantage that the next day they do not suffer a terrible hangover at home.
Morning headache, caused by dehydration and lack of glucose, is avoided by injection of a serum with glucose and nutrients that are missing the body.
"They bring him much better, because after the busy night, they get up well and don't hurt them anything."
"They are only confused about where they are," says Pelikán, adding that patients often lose their sense of humor at least when they see the expenses they have generated.
Transfers in ambulance and hospitalization in a room for severe patients cost about ten thousand crowns.
"I have often used the cost as a means of educating them, when I tell the children directly how much it has cost their drunkenness and that they would have to spend all summer at a job for young people to earn enough to pay that night," says Pelikán.
The medical insurance, in your opinion, may as a retrogressive measure, which usually pays back to people the costs of treatment, does not do so in the case of children who drink.
Two L-159 aircraft are in the hands of others in Spain for the first time
Two L-159 planes of a total of five, for which the Czech Ministry of Defense replaced the C-295M aircraft, set off on Tuesday for Seville, where the manufacturer of the Casa - EADS aircraft is located.
This is the first time a device of this type is in the hands of someone other than the Czech army.
For the time being, they were only abroad to carry out flights of practice or demonstration.
This is the biplative version L-159T1, which so far used the Czech army and was still in a state of flight.
The remaining three aircraft are the L-159.
These are still kept in Aer Vodochody and the sales broker, Omnipol, was already taken over last week.
Jan Peješk, of the defense press department, indicates that it is not yet known when the planes physically from Vodochody will be withdrawn.
"The L-159, on the other hand, were separated from the aircraft repaired a long time ago, without additional investments or contributions from the Ministry."
"The L-159T1 biplaces were exchanged in their current state," he told Právo Pejšek.
He added that the army did not run out of two-wing aircraft, since in May 2009 the army signed a contract with Aer Vodochody for an amount of 200 million crowns for the construction of four unnecessary L-159 devices for two-places.
One of the new planes already received it in July, the other will be delivered at the end of the year.
According to Pejšek, EADS undertook to add aircraft to the equipment of some Allied countries.
"The contract clearly indicates that EADS is the one that removes L-159 aircraft and will serve for the practices of pilots from NATO countries."
"It is therefore up to the buyer to decide how to use them in this framework," says Pejšek.
The newspaper Hospodářské noviny published before time that, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 by a Casa plane and the purchase of three other aircraft by 3,500 million crowns were approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defence did not convene a bidding for purchase and negotiated directly with EADS.
The current defence direction states that the exchange promotes the future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army acquired Aer 72 aircraft and only uses 24, so he wants to sell the rest.
The purchase of planes House is likely to have legal consequences.
The European Commission has already denounced the Czech Ministry of Defence before the European Court of Justice because it should choose aircraft by conducting a European tender and not by contacting a single manufacturer.
The army has already received three Casa planes and the last one should arrive at Kbely’s airport in 14 days.
A longer index finger than the annular indicates a lower risk of cancer
Men with the longest rate that annular is subject to a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the startling conclusion of a study published on Wednesday in a British journal on cancer.
They could depend on testosterone level, male hormone.
"Our results indicate that the relative finger length can be a simple test of the risk of prostate cancer, particularly for men up to 60 years of age," said the co-author of the Ros Eeles study, professor of the Institute for Cancer Research at Warwick University.
Therefore, the finger could help determine which men should be tested for prostate cancer, in particular if this characteristic is associated with a genetic risk or other harmful factors, such as family health problems, Eeles says.
During the period 1994-2009, he followed up with a British counterpart of over 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and, at the same time, 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the shortest indica finger of the right hand.
They had the same odds of suffering prostate cancer as 19% of those whose fingers were of the same length.
In the case of men with a longer rate than the annular finger, this risk was reduced by 33 per cent; for men below 60 per cent, the reduction reached 87 per cent.
The relationship between the length of the two fingers in question, determined in the prenatal period, reflects different levels of hormones to which the fetus is exposed in the matrix.
A lower testosterone level corresponds to a longer index.
Previous studies indicated that testosterone affects the development of prostate cancer.
The great Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, Professor Václav Pačes, told ČTK that he knows the study, but that it does not seem to him that the relationship between finger length and cancer can be "extremely demonstrated".
The Czech Republic under snow: D1 and D5 are closed
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, sunk on snow-covered Thursdays.
The roads and sidewalks are mainly covered by compact snow and the quitanive machines circulated all night through numerous areas.
In the morning the road D5 between miles 89 and 93 was closed towards Rozvadov due to several accidents in industrial vehicles and tourism, as was the D1 road in Brno towards Prague.
The news broadcast them by the operator of Ústředniho automotoklubu (UAMK).
In kilometre 91 a truck was hit, in 93 two industrial vehicles were hit and injured.
Several tourists also ended up in the country.
There are also problems in the D1 motorway at kilometer 185 towards Prague.
Two trucks were hit there.
Drivers must move slowly after Brno at kilometer 190 or cross Brno and be incorporated at kilometer 182 in Kývalce.
Traps of several kilometres have been formed there.
There has also been an accident on the road D11, right next to Prague.
Prague is covered by a multi-centimeter snow cover and the thermometers indicate -7 oC.
Stacks are being formed for example in Prosek, although it is also congested Štěrboholská.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
The trams circulate with delay, for example in the line between Karlovo náměstí and Náměstí Míru.
At eight in the morning, another state of crisis will occur in Prague.
The problems also affect railways and airport.
Because of the snow, the Czech railway company had to cancel seven connections by three fast.
The problems affect, for example, the line between Prague and Kralupy or Prague and Beroun.
Travellers should check the current situation.
Ruzyně Airport was closed from 11 a.m. on Wednesday until 5 a.m.
At present, most roads in the south of Moravia are already available, but with extreme caution.
In Vyškovska three secondary roads are closed to the road, in Brněnska snow tongues are being formed and in Blanenska chains are needed to access certain routes of access to the highest points.
One of the most affected places was Vyškovsko.
Up to now the connections are closed: Rousinov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
To clear them, millers will be required.
It cannot be said at the moment when the movement will be opened.
In Hodonínska, caution is required in the Bílé Karpathy area (White Carpathians).
The roads in the region which, since it is a protected natural zone, must simply be left inert, accumulate up to five centimeters of snow, ČTK indicates.
In Chechnya they fell between two and ten centimeters of snow, further north of Bohemia, where the snow cover reaches 18 centimeters.
In the Moravia-Silesia region, they fell about 15 centimeters of snow.
The snows are gradually rising in Chequia.
American soldiers have a new "smart weapon"
The American army is using a new "intelligent" weapon in Afghanistan, known for the moment only as XM-25.
The generals hope that the new rifle will influence the local conflict with the Taliban and that "change the progress of the game" will do its victory.
The new weapons are like a small gun and with an extremely accurate shot.
Its bullets are fired with a laser with a precision of several meters.
The special 25 mm-caliber ammo created for this rifle and the high load of explosives it contains causes it actually to function as a small grenade.
Projectiles can be programmed to explode not only when they hit the target but at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
They can be used against enemies who hide behind an obstacle, a wall or a trenches.
Without a doubt, normal protection cannot be used, and when it throws its murderous rain of metal chips, it can be essential in the battle.
According to Richard Audette, who spoke about the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon that uses a "intelligent" technology.
"The soldiers manipulate it in such a way that they find the target, point to the same laser beam, which determines the distance, then gets a precise point of view and, depending on it, corrects the projection line and tightens the trigger."
"Let's say it's been 543 meters."
"When the trigger is pressed, the gun loads and launches the projectile at a distance of 543 meters, plus one, two or three meters," says Audette.
400 posts were transferred
The Fujitsu consortium moved its branch to Bad Homburg in Frankfurt.
In July of the following year, 400 employees will change their workplace from their former office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
Japan’s Fujitsu consortium moved its branch to Bad Homburg in Frankfurt.
As reported by the computer sector giant and its maintenance on Wednesday, 400 men and women will move in July of the following year from their previous office building in Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large office complex at Lyoner Straße Street in Niederrad district, Frankfurt.
A spokesman for Fujitsu explained that in the medium term, 100 more employees of the consortium, who were previously scattered by the region, will be housed there.
The offer is highly attractive, as well as the collective office in Astro Park will favor the way employees work.
In addition, Fujitsu will be the only tenant in Bad Homburg.
Director Bernd Wagner said, "in Franfkurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure."
The brilliant connection to the airport is currently very important for a global company such as Fujitsu.
The new move of an important company in the region caused yesterday joy among those who were in favour and disappointment among those who were against.
The head of the Frankfurt Economics Section, Markus Frank (CDU) said that with that he had won a Global Player.
This is a "magnificent recognition of the site".
Fujitsu sits in the city, settlement is a great impulse for Niederrad.
Bod Hombruger Mayor Michael Korwisi (Greens) regrets Fujitsu's decision.
The address earlier informed the city of its intention.
"Of course we have offered the company our help," Korwisi said.
However, the good contacts of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property in Marienbader Platz have not been able to change in the difficulties.
After all, economic reasons produced the fall.
Thus, there is now a great empty place to cover in the famous position.
"I hope that the owner and the landlord of the building will be shown cooperatives."
The property previously used by Fujitsu in Rathausplatz and the neighbor "Kleine Vertikale" had been part of the remaining buildings of Marienbader Platz for ten years in a controversial project for the construction of the seaside city.
As a joint project of the city and a private project company between the station and the city council, a new entrance to the city is formed, which is responsible for the criticism of the massive building that previously used holes as parking spaces and the level of buildings.
In 2001 the investment consultancy and taxing companies were installed, the software manufacturer for booking systems, Start Amadeus, as well as then joined Siemens with the factory manufacturer of Fujitsu computers.
In 2006, the building used by Fujitsu was purchased by the real estate group of Frankfurt, Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Groupe together with Morgan Stanley Real Estate and a year later resold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Fujitsu consortium, coming from Tokyo, is recognized as the third largest provider of IT.
It has companies, such as computers and servers, and also provides the necessary services.
The branch in Rhein-Main-Gebiet is one of the largest in Germany, however Fujitsu has more business in Munich.
The Fujitsu Technology Solutions branch is installed from Bad Homburg in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the following subsidiaries will be Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
That's why they rented 7,000 square meters in the Astro Park office building.
The ancient complex of the 1920s, its name alludes to its star-shaped plan, inter alia, to the central electrotechnical association and the electronic industry.
Amazon cancels the server - Assange Threats
The anguish is taking over more and more Wikileaks.
The Amazon Internet Service Provider has removed the disclosure platform from your server.
Possibly behind are political pressure following the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic documents.
Assange, the founder of Wikileaks, is apparently detained in England.
Wikileaks' platform of revelations is always the target of criticism, always stronger in the United States.
Internet activists lost access to their former American server and are currently looking for an Internet country in Europe.
The well-known American senator, Joe Lieberman, calls other countries and businesses to the boycott of Wikileaks.
And the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, on the list of people wanted by Interpol, must remain detained in Britain, according to one article.
"Wikileaks expelled from the Amazon server."
"Speaking freely in the country of freedom," the activists of the revelations were communicating through the Twitter messaging service on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the internet company, Amazon, had deleted Wikileaks documents from its server.
Internet activists had resorted to the publication of secret diplomatic documents on the Amazon service web to be able to cope with high numbers of access to documents.
On Twitter, Wikileaks explained the following: "Perfect, we're going to spend our dollars on hiring people in Europe."
If Amazon has problems with freedom of expression, "they should stop selling books."
Amazon stopped using its server via Wikileaks, after a Senator Joe Lieberman employee had requested investigations, reported the CNN chain according to a call to the Lieberman office.
The presidency of the Senate Council for the security of the country had threatened Amazon with boycott, reported the British "Guardian".
"I wanted Amazon to take these measures before, before previous information publications classified by Wikileaks," the senator declared.
Lieberman also requested that the platform also prohibit the use of the server in other countries.
"The illegal, monstrous and contemptuous process of Wikileaks jeopardises our national security and threatens life in the world," he said in a statement by the independent senator.
"No responsible company, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks with their service to extend stolen material.
The founder of Wikileaks, Assange, who is searched in Sweden for suspicion of rape, is on the list of people wanted from Interpol.
According to an article in the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian is detained in Britain, Scotland Yard knows the exact place.
The Internet activist has consistently described the investigation in Sweden as a plot of his enemy.
The spokesperson for Wikileaks, Kristinn Hrafnsson, stated in London that there have been threats.
"There were even calls about a murder of Julian Assange."
That's why he's afraid of Assange's safety, Hrafnsson said.
Therefore, the location of the founder of Wikileaks remains undisclosed.
Hrafnsson evidently responded to statements from North America.
In America, former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, stated that the person responsible for Wikileaks' revelations must be judged for treason and must be executed.
In Canada, a government chief's advisor Stephen Harper, clearly ironically, on television, Assange should be "killed" and Obama could "use a drone."
Between the White House and Assange there is a great dispute.
Robert Gibbs, the spokesperson for American President Barack Obama, called Assange's "ridiculous and absurd" a request for the resignation of the State Secretary, if she is responsible for ordering diplomats who are involved in spying tasks recently.
"I'm not entirely sure why we should care about a guy's opinion with a website," Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much stronger than their website."
The U.S. government has to demonstrate the effectiveness of protecting its databases in general.
Russell Travers, deputy director of the distribution of the National Counter-Terrorism Centre, was appointed an exceptional officer, announced the White House.
Thus Travers is responsible for developing "the important structural reforms", which are necessary in the light of Wikileaks filtering.
The White House also wants to inspect the roads, as well as change the total information about the government and protect it.
In addition, the American government announced that to take care of the security of dissidents and activists, the publication of Wikileaks must be compromised.
"We have done all we can to get in touch with them," said the Head of the State Department, Philip Crowley.
"We are prepared to help protect them if necessary."
The University of Ice cream
Ice creams are prepared at the "Gelato University" in Bologna in the best times of the year.
The three-day basic course for future ice creammakers has the greatest influx and visitors from all over the world.
Where does all the ice cream actually come from?
Ice cream and ice cream.
The gelatiere produces cream according to all the rules of Italian art of ice creammaking.
The ice cream comes out with a spatula of the counter ice cream, spreads it over the boat and sells it.
To know this, you don't need to go to Anzola dell'Emily in the province of Bologna.
But whoever wants to know more about ice creams should not visit the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The manufacturer has equipped the ice cream university with the freezer in 2003, so that the ice cream of his machines meets the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future ice creammakers has the greatest influx and visitors from all over the world.
There are also more special courses of more days on chocolate ice cream and practices in the ice cream shop of the house itself.
In these times of crisis, some dream of a new career, others risk in the gentle frost their vague desires.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia going through Hungary.
Jacky, a professor of this art in California, loves the slow movement of food and in the future wants to offer a quality European product in the land of industrial ice cream.
Anke, from Berlin, is a business consultant and wants to create something of his own in a few years in an annoying job.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening a ice cream shop in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil want to improve the quality of the ice creams in their bars, and a Canadian housewife, Julia, comes because her children love Italian ice creams.
The ice cream master Luciano Ferrari explains to the participants the ideal qualities of the perfect ice cream.
It is decisive not only their good taste, but also their silky softness and good consistency.
Luciano does not forget his formation or the cream cover of the national upper house and mainly of the south of the country: "The Italian ice cream is simply the best, and that's why every ball has something romantic."
The first step in processing seems very easy.
Luciano puts out the basic ingredients: milk, cream, powdered milk, sugar and stabilizers in a large blender, which heats everything with an electronic program up to 85 degrees and currently cools it up to four degrees.
Then open the machine tap and come out a basic pasteurized white cream, the base for all kinds of milk ice creams.
Suddenly, the teacher asks: Can ice cream be made only with natural elements or without sterilizer?
How can you give free rein to some desire to experiment?
Luciano advises that the trends of the time be dismissed.
The one who speaks of ice cream "not only of natural ingredients", at best has used stabilizers, mainly a natural product, probably guar gum, of beans guar.
Of course you can make ice cream without stabilizer, you just have to buy it one day, put it in a bag and the customer will bite a granite ice cream sound.
Certain variations in basic mass are allowed.
Flavours are used.
As for the taste of ice cream, the master Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients that are bought in the fruit section or in the sweets of the supermarket.
Besides, there are dust and pastes.
"All suppliers will try to paste flavoured ingredients into their merchandise."
"But they must try some time."
Whether with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or even with the ice cream of the white basic dough, which with eggs will become a yellow cream and with powder cocoa as a basis for all possible chocolate pleasures.
Now the course participants can use the ice creamers.
Luciano lets them develop four different types of vanilla ice cream, chocolate, moca and hazelnut, with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural ingredients.
They perform the same experiment also with types of fruit ice cream.
Knowing better does not necessarily depend on having more flavor of tofe or more pure fruit.
There is no need for the hazelnut ice to know about dried fruits, if it contains more hazelnuts.
The working group develops the lovely kiwi ice cream, which uses more fruits, less water and a little less stabiliser.
First, a balanced mixture highlights the taste of ice cream, says Luciano.
Ice cream is a problem of artimetics: The pure melocoton with lots of sugar is used, the proportion of sugar of the basic recipe must be lowered.
For lemon ice cream you need an extra portion of sugar.
Luciano takes out a tool with which to fix the amount of sugar of the fruit types (measurement of the winemaker for Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables make the account easy.
Working ice cream only requires physical application, as before.
Not only does it help the tool for automatic processing of the basic mass.
There is also a tool, in which the mixture of prepared ice cream is simultaneously beaten and cooled to a low temperature.
However, all automation remains out on the small paste.
Brazilian Gustavo spots himself and his companions from top to bottom with fruit purée, as if he were a giant miniprimer without control.
"In all courses," says Maestro Luciano, "it's just a matter of time that happens like this."
Inspectors in a complicated situation
The European Food Safety Authority Efsa has infiltrated the transgenic plant industry.
This issue is currently being formulated by the Expert Group Testbiotech, which is considered an independent institute for the assessment of the impact of biotechnology.
"It looks like a conspiracy theory but we haven't documented it properly," said Christoph Then, director of Testbiotech, Wednesday in Munich.
Harry Kuiper, the director of Efsa's expert group on genetically modified plants, and another Efsa expert have also been engaged for years in the Ilsi association.
Consortiums like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer cost it.
Kuiper has collaborated significantly in Efsa's verification standards of genetically modified plants, which places him in a clear conflict of interests, critical Then.
Efsa's provisions are in paragraphs with the same terms as the documentation of the situation of Ilsi and imitate the company's writing, which is actually controlled by its Italian authorities in Parma.
This is the second time that Testbiotech criticizes a collision of interests.
So, recently, a high-ranking Efsa manager went without the support or the transition time to the Swiss Agrarkonzern Syngenta, and he has changed his ban with that.
Recently, Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) also revealed personal connections between the EU inspection authorities and industry, which carried out the General Environment Office and an EU parliamentary clairvoyance.
However, Efsa cannot recognize any conflict of interest.
All formal data, also some of the industry, provided they are of high quality and technical quality, are ordered in a report.
Experts working in Efsa are not required to have no contact with the industry.
But these contacts must be exposed.
Kuiper supports his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States
It is called a neutral forum for experts and science, industry and politics, among others for the risk assessment for biotechnology without Lobby's burden.
In this issue, independent experts, such as Then, criticise that transgenic plants are currently allowed without investigating animal food and that the influence of genetically modified plants in the environment is not verified.
"We want to know what, for example, does genetically modified maize in agriculture," Then.
The current practice is to only check isolated proteins, but not the whole transgenic plant, which does not produce reliable results.
"If you don't look for the risks, how will you find them?", asks, accuser, Then.
Angelina Hilbeck feels the same way.
The scientist has been investigating the field of genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Zurich Technical Institute.
In this area, industry is increasingly trying, in the US and Europe, to influence or discredit critical scientists.
So there are few scientists who are not influenced by consortia.
For companies, critical studies are not published in general.
"Industry controls security research," maintains Hilbeck.
The trail of stones
Uli Gsell has got some, a total of 400 kilos.
On Monday he was in front of Stuttgart station, with the tuba on his back.
There were demonstrations
Nevaba.
History is known: In September the excavators arrived and began to tear down a large piece of the northern wing.
The land of Stuttgart was never again the same: Miles and thousands protested against the s21, the suspension of millions at the station.
As he was stuck, most of the wing was torn apart.
Rotate in 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a rough soft stone, built between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He's secured a couple pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"You mustn't disappear."
He was excited: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and natural."
As you once said, you've smelled the smoke of cigarettes.
He still doesn't know what he's going to do with the pieces.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
The stone trail of Stuttgart leads to a forest in Tubingen in a former French Navy ammunition tank, where Manuel Rongen erected his Stein-Reich stone.
The 44-year-old man deals with ancient stones.
He bought everything from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"She would be ashamed, would grind the gravel, or would send it to the dumpster," she says in her office, a wooden cottage that once was a guard's cassette.
He was insulted and threatened, and he explains, when he appeared in the newspapers in September, that he had bought the remains of the northern wing to the wreckage company.
He spoke to the 21S enemies for several days.
And he explained to them that he could do absolutely nothing for the downfall.
And when it happened, then it was most reasonable, when the stones continued to be used.
Some 200 S21 enemies took the 80-kilometre maxizo, with a price per piece of 6.50 to 14 euros.
Some took it as a memory but also in the hope of being able to return it in a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, a cargo of 25 trucks.
Approximately half is still in the forest, the rest of it was sold a long time ago.
Garden owner, landscape gardener, project manager.
They came from all over and took what they could carry in the trunk and above.
Stuttgart’s stone of the impulse has long become “the wall” or the delimitation of Kräuterbeeten.
"In fact, this stone is nothing special," Rongen says.
"If it weren't for the political component."
He ascends to his underground, makes a tour for his great kingdom of 20 hectares.
He studied law, interrupted his studies, and later biology, he was interested in computers and finally worked with stones.
And he's a stone lover.
It houses 4,000 tons of stone.
Transport your treasures throughout Germany.
He says he's the biggest dealer of ancient stones in the country.
Slow down.
In the snow there are artifact cut sandstones.
"They belonged to the bridge of Dresden Marienbrücke," he explains.
White chalice, yellow, warm, enthusiastic.
"My dear stone."
The path crosses the forest.
He points out a pile: Red Arenisca, an earlier piece of Karlsruhe station.
And go on.
"Good travertine."
Meanwhile, the Mazizos belonged to the Neckarstadion rostrum in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow, stones and stories, yellow transvertine of the police chief of Stuttgart, red granite of the church Sankt Blasien, drum of Heilbronner Hospital.
What a job, what an effort, what a sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how he carved the stones before and moved them with a simple device and a cart, he feels very devoted.
"It would be a scandal if something were destroyed."
He has not become rich, at all extremely rich.
But today 14 people were given to do to the stone dealer, as well as canteens, a sculptor, a locksmith, a window and a gardener have settled up in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's satisfactory," says the man who takes care of taking advantage of the remains.
Soon you have to go to Cologne.
There are also stones to rescue.
Talent struggle around great potentials
There's an active fluency in the buffet.
16 students flock around the pans, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the manufacturer of Vokswagen cars have invited students to a workshop of mechanical engineering and design.
In a sort of idea contest, you have to talk about the car of the future with VW workers and also learn all about Volkswagen.
Revaluation and in the same way, many companies, such as VW, meet in a body-to-body struggle around the most privileged minds in collaborations with universities.
His mission: To hire the most talented students in universities as soon as possible, before they enter the labour market and are hired by others.
And since universities do not provide publications about their students’ skills, they try to highlight the exceptional talents in practical projects and capture them.
The second day of project at the Technical University of Braunscheig, the consortium wins the talents.
A lady from the staff department distributes pens, elbows and folders with the VW logo.
He explains to the excited young talents the training and work programmes for students and shows them their ways in the consortium.
Nico Selle from Braunschweig Technical University carries the project with VW.
It sees advantages for both parties: "Students come into contact with industry and gain experience."
"In turn, VW can meet students, observe interesting candidates more closely and consider them as potential future workers."
Some collaborations, Selle says, are not uncommon.
The novelty is that students are wanted so directly.
"The main point was previously in technical projects," Selle says.
The fight for fresh graduates is getting harder.
In many branches, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large group of applicants.
Unless they have to be announced and, above all, to get a highly qualified workforce.
All students in engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating situation.
According to the German Association of Engineers (VDI for its German acronyms), in October there were 40,000 vacant engineers.
And, according to VDI forecasts, this engineering vacuum will grow even more.
At the audit and advisory company, KPMG, Roman Dykta is responsible for hunting talent.
It organizes costly recruitment events, such as the KPMG race, a modern yincana type, in which participants have to find their way through GPS coordinates.
The company wants to send eight very promising students to the US next year.
In addition, participants can observe the KPMG subsidiaries and learn about the company.
It is decided who should go in two rounds of choice at the exit.
Only the cream cream of many participants goes to the United States.
Universities are increasingly working on choosing and polishing the potentials of universities, according to Dykta.
"With the race we want to highlight the mass."
"The simple journey alone was short for us."
For the Dykta hunters the notes give results.
"Even today we have similar action in the last year with all participants."
"Some people are near their end, and they want to ask to work with us," he says.
In addition to the direct approach on campus, they are also hunting, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, classic with their labor fairs.
"We're trying to get students at specialized fairs."
"Something about Intersolar," says Sitha Stübe, in charge of personnel for Solarworld solar technology manufacturer.
Bonner has approximately 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the problem of the new generation.
Currently, 35 vacant posts appear on the company's website.
"It is being very complicated to fill the vacant posts."
"It costs a lot of time and money," he says.
A shorter path is contact with university teachers.
Solarworld collaborates with several higher schools, for example, Freiberg University.
"Teachers advise that they can do practice with us or perform their theses.
No advertising campaigns are carried out for solar specialists.
That's why the company needs to be promoted with other advantages: Personal environment, plain hierarchy and comfortable communication.
"A large consortium cannot normally offer it," says Stübe, the staff manager.
In the search for a job, money is no longer the most important thing.
The decisive factors are flexible working hours, assistance to children or good possibilities for promotion.
According to a study by the Great Place to Work Institutes, Solarworld holds 55 among the 100 best employers in Germany.
The Institute shall draw up an annual list of the best German job providers.
As to what the employee asks how satisfied he is with the work and the environment in the same and observes the previous conditions of the employees.
Stübe, the staff member also expects extra points in his classification by his aspirants to work.
"I believe that the applicant is particularly fixed in the external classifications of a potential employer," he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from Deutschen Employer Branding Akademie advises companies that want a long-term strategy that earns a good reputation as employers.
Give your customers more authenticity.
And that means, according to Kriegler, above all, internal measures.
"The best way to become attractive as an employer passes through the employees themselves," he says.
In the yard of the sector it is called Internal Employer Branding, also promoting corporate identity within the staff itself.
"A satisfied employee is the best ambassadors."
When people are well treated and identified with the company, then promotion is obtained directly for the employer by friends and acquaintances.
"It's like a gang game," Kriegler says.
Obama stops new oil drilling
From the coast of the U.S. state of Florida to the Gulf of Mexico, there has been no new oil drilling in these years.
The Washington government issued an overwhelming ban and thereby cancelled its previous plans in an impeccable manner.
Also in front of the Atlantic coast remain new perforations sealed for the time being.
This announced the Minister of the Interior, Ken Salazar, on Wednesday.
What prompted this strict ban, which will be in force for at least the next five years, is the explosion of the oil platform "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Before the tragedy that cost 11 workers their lives and caused the greatest environmental catastrophe in the United States, President Barack Obama had admitted new drilling in the western part of the Gulf of Mexico under pressure from the opposition and industry.
The supporters wanted to reduce the United States' dependence on new foreign oil supplies.
Until today it has not been fully clarified who is responsible for the irreparable black tide in the Gulf.
At the centre of criticism is the British energy consortium BP, which is faced with millions of demands.
A research commission commissioned by Obama will present its results in December.
In October, Ken Salazar, the interior minister, lifted the drilling moratorium after the explosion.
Subsequently, various peteroler consortia submitted applications for new drilling attempts.
Obama and Salazar want to rule out a new catastrophe by using harder controls and stricter security regulations.
Currently, the responsible control authority, which has been charged with corruption charges has fallen into disbelief, is reformed by root.
Obama announces in parallel that lucrative tax gaps will be closed for oil and gas consortia.
The industry publicly announces that the total extraction in the Gulf will be lower thanks to stricter regulation, so far.
"Government plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industries," says the current survey conducted by the BDO advisory company - before the ban on extraction of Wednesday.
American Energy Alliance complains about insecurity in the sector: "No one knows exactly what changes with regulation."
Investments in new extraction projects are prolonged as soon as possible, to the detriment of growth.
Ogonyland is ruined
The water of the rivers is oil brown, it smells like a gas station: Millions of gallons of crude spills have destroyed nature in the Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live from theft, corruption and illegal oil trade.
Celestine Akpobari looks good.
"Don't get tired," the environmental activist reassures the journalists: "Today will pass enough oil before your eyes."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has managed to photograph boys walking in the water to the chest with the brightness of the lights reflected in turbulence on the surface: With the colorful brightness of the water, the scene seems almost beautiful.
There is no evidence that brown oil stains float on the surface.
I used to catch leggings here, explains Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the fluid waters are totally dead.
Five years ago, an impressive amount of oil was poured into the formidable wetlands by a broken pipe.
The fishes in the vicinity of the small town of Bodo had to swim six hours to reach the waters full of fish: That, in the heart of the Niger Delta and located in Ogoniland, is considered one of the most stinky regions of the world.
On the way to the river that passes through mangroves, the vast desolation is obvious.
Instead of clear water, the boat's engine removes a brown broth, which sinks its hand into the water, will take out a lot of oil.
The roots of mangrove trees rise from the ground as dark regaliz poles, sadly isolate the palm trees that shock and hang their palms.
In vain we are looking for flocks of birds, as if they were in the wetlands as always: As soon as the barrier of the outside is shut, we expand on it a kind of ghostly calm of an earlier paradise with the smell of gasoline.
"What's happening here is an ecological struggle," says Horaño, Celestine Akpobari. "We live in constant danger to health."
The war comparison is proceeding.
The Ogoni settlement area has been a resounding battleground for years: Here more than 60 years ago, the first European explorers, here was organized the first resistance in the 1980s with writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, later executed, here he had to place his first factory Shell consortium in 1993, because it would be too dangerous for oil workers.
Even today, the return of companies to Ogoniland is prohibited: As more than two million barrels of black gold were pumped daily in the entire delta region, three times larger than Switzerland, with more than 5,000 extraction sources and 7,000 kilometres of pipelines, the oil fields in Ogoniland were quiet, the location is too unstable for the consortium.
Every 200 metres steel platforms were highlighted as extraphalary water sculptures: "Christmas trees" affectionately called the heads of the drills.
They are up to 50 years old, most have total corrosion.
Every moment a head fails, Akpobari says, then it sends a constant oil jet into the water.
According to experts' assessments, more than two billion litres have been poured in 50 years into the delta's ecosystem: Year after year, the amount of oil penetrates, as in the shoreline of the ship "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago in the Alaska Sea, one of the greatest ecological catastrophes in human history.
Whoever is responsible for the long-term environmental region will deal with this.
While Shell Consortium and organized oil thefts are responsible for more than 90 percent of pollution, environmentalists see heads about to break down and pipes with leaks like the main causes.
In Nigeria, Shell mainly applies low safety standards in the world, conventional ones, reproached scientist Richard Steiner to the consortium in 2008: Only the defect indexes of the pipes are "on a multiple larger than elsewhere".
In a place, which from far away seems forgotten, there appears a workshop full of oil under the free sky, figures emerge from among the mangroves: they are naked and covered with oil.
Among one of the many barrels, which are sometimes attached to drilling, sometimes arbitrarily scattered on the ground, fires a fire: a small illegal refinery.
In the barrel, oil warms up in the fire more hours, explains Michael, the leader of the group.
First, the gasoline penetrates through the pipes in the container, later the oil pipe drops and eventually comes out diesel.
In this way, Michael and four employees produce daily up to four barrels of diesel of 300 liters: "It gives us 34,000 naira", about $22.
Delta people take advantage of fuel shortages in one of the largest oil states in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
With the absurd and cheap diesel price of only 40 euros-cent per litre illegal heaters can offer even less: This reduces the value of their raw material.
It comes from "the bunkers" who called the pipeline network that runs through Ogoniland: According to experts, at this step at least 16 million litres of oil are lost daily throughout the Niger Delta.
Only a small part of the provisional raw material stored is defined in an illegal way: Organized criminal networks, which also belong to politicians and high military positions, keep the best part in algebras and sell it cheaply on the world market.
Activist Akpobari considers the debate purely academic about whether the environmental catastrophe is due rather to the management of the population or to the loose mode of production.
"If oil tankers did not act as invaders and did not completely destroy the natural habitat of fish, there would be no sabotage, no theft, no illegal refinery."
While the conditions of the ogoni are mostly shattered by Shell to the point that only a deduction of the consortium appears: "Perhaps it is better to present another nationality, such as China."
Michael's getting nervous.
"It's time for you to disappear," says the muscular Ölmann.
"Soldiers can come any minute."
If the special unit of the army takes the illegal refiners, it does not threaten to arrest them, except with a painful bribe.
Soldiers from the north also want, like all Nigerians, to take advantage of raw material.
"This damned invention has made completely bits of our country," Akpobari says.
Researchers detect dangerous factory defects in A380 engines
The A380 seems to have a major security problem.
In an investigation of a machine that made a forced landing, the researchers found a possible factory defect, which can produce "a catastrophic failure in the engine".
The Qantas airline wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
The passengers at Qantas Airbus who carried out an emergency landing in early November were much more fortunate than the one you can imagine: Australian air security authorities perceived through their investigations a major safety problem in the engines of some A380, and alerted to a possible factory failure.
The potential defect has complicated implications: In a hose connection, fatigue cracks or cracks can be caused, ATSB authorities announced in a report published on Thursday.
This could have caused "a catastrophic failure in the engine".
This affected engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce belonging to 20 aircraft in the A380 series.
Amongst the Qantas-Airbus that had to carry out a forced landing on November 4 in Singapore.
The Australian airline starts legal media against the British turbine manufacturer.
He filed a lawsuit in the federal court in Sidney that allowed more legal measures against the company.
Alan Joyce, director of Qantas, stated that his airline will claim compensation for the beginning incident in November.
The engine brand has lost parts and its wing is damaged.
Rolls Royce distinguishes the type of gasoline as the cause of damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines from around the world have to be replaced.
Australian researchers have announced that they will carry out more safety tests for superjumbs equipped with the engines affected.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls Royce, said Martin Dolan, spokesperson for ATSB.
The security problem has become important enough to inform all concerned.
After the Qantas emergency landing, the airline maintained its A380 fleet on land for many weeks.
Singapore Airlines maintained approximately three of its eleven A380 temporarily on land.
Lufthansa rejected the engine of an A380 as a precautionary measure.
This double decked plane is the world's largest passenger plane.
A Nevada throughout the country causes chaos in traffic
Totally white Germany: From one day to another it has snowed in almost the whole country.
In many streets chaos reigns, trains and planes fail.
At least three people have lost their lives in traffic accidents.
Winter hiela Germany: In almost all the country, cold temperatures were reached during the night of Thursday, which has triggered chaos in traffic in many points.
In some parts of the north and east, there is a 15-centimeter thick layer of snow.
Traffic is very limited on most highways and many streets.
In the A7 at the height of Flensburg, the takeoffs are in continuous operation, removing the new snow over and over, but is not prepared.
In addition, strong gusts of wind sweep the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The German Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency (BSH) expects living tides with a water level of 1.2 metres above its usual level on the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holsteins.
In Saxony snow accumulation caused considerable problems on highways and national roads.
According to the weather service Meteomedia, the red alert is called in Sächsischen Schweiz, in fact the highest alert.
There are partially 30 centimeters of freshly fallen snow and cold and strong winds take care of it.
Many trucks and cars were caught there during the night.
Also in Saxony Anhalt, the police authorities reported major riots on the streets.
In the A2, snow and wind paralysed traffic and created bottlenecks.
In Thuringia the snows affected both the A4 and the A9.
According to Deutscher Bahn, major disorders are expected in Saxony, Saxony Anhalt, Thuringia and in northern Bavaria.
The snow on the road, the trees falling on the lanes or the destroyed catenary and the holes are the main problems.
In Saxony, Leipzig's interurban service is suspended in Nuremberg.
In Saafeld, Thuringia a ICE train had to stop her trip to Munich.
Firefighters and rescue service attended the 165 passengers on the train with wool blankets, food and drink.
The winds with snow sweep the streets.
At the largest German airport, snow winds caused numerous suspensions of flights.
According to a spokesman for the flight information centre, some cancellations have already been announced in Munich.
In Frankfurt am Main, according to a Fraport spokesperson there are already 40 flights cancelled.
The take-offs are in continuous operation.
However, there are few passengers running at the airport, despite that there are 400 camp beds prepared for them.
On many streets, on Wednesday afternoon there were many accidents.
In the afternoon a truck driver died in a collision with a train on a road crossing in Ostholstein.
The driver suffered slight injuries.
In the vicinity of Nuremberg there was a similar accident because of the snowy streets: Here too a truck was reached on a road crossing because the vehicle was jammed.
The driver lost his life.
On the train four passengers were injured, the journey from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was blocked for this reason in the morning.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died, after taking a ride with her car near Aschaffenburg on a smooth road.
Weatherers have good news: The snow will be more and more soft and dusty, and therefore it will slide into soft cracks.
But the wind will decline.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by strong and fast winds.
It will certainly continue to be very cold, in some places up to 15 degrees negative.
Deuxche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers
The Deutsche Bank wants to separate from its symbol: According to an article, the financial institution seeks buyer for its office towers at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
The property could bring up to 500 million euros.
Deutschen Bank recently settled its headquarters: Twin towers were modernized in the Frankfurt banking district; while bankers returned to their old workplace.
But now the financial consortium seems to want to take advantage of the costs of reroving, and look for a buyer for both skyscrapers, as the "Financial Times Deutschland" says based on a spokesperson.
The Spokesperson does not name the reasons for the project sale.
"We always check whether property should be owned or sold and then re-rent them," he said.
That is why Germany's largest credit institution once again renounces its company's headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank acquired the twin towers in mid-2007 for EUR 272 million from the investor of a fund of the house and then made the relevant arrangements.
Energy reforms reached approximately EUR 200 million.
A sale would make a lot of money for the bank.
Experts in this area calculate the value of the towers of the newspaper renowned as "Greentowers" in about 500 million euros.
If the refurbished buildings are sold at a bank fund or an independent investor has not been disclosed at the moment, the spokesman said.
Thousands of people mourning for the dead miners
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people thought about the buried miners, who died after many explosions in a mine.
However, the corpses have not been found, because security measures remain precarious in the place of misfortune.
Almost two weeks ago there was an intense explosion in the Pike River mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were buried in the mine.
A probe was introduced to the place of misfortune, but it did not discover any sign of survival.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and successive explosions, no rescue equipment was able to drop for safety reasons.
After the second intense detonation, the authorities and experts deduced that there was no chance that the miners would have survived.
The bodies have not been recovered to date.
Family members and friends today remember those who died with a commemorative act.
Ten thousand people have changed with the bright glow of the sun in Greymouth on the New Zealand island of the south.
They keep silence for two minutes.
In tribute to the buried miners, 29 tables were placed with the helmets, lamps and the names of the miners.
There were also photographs and personal objects, under clothes and surfboards.
The flags flowed to the country's government buildings on a half-station.
New Zealand hoped that the miners would return to the surface "of the earth's depths," said John Key, the president of the New Zealand government, to the participants of the commemorative event.
"But they never came home."
He cannot assume the death of his son until he has seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the mine.
Together with the president of the government and the relatives of the victims participated in the commemorative act many foreign diplomats.
Mines from British and South African origin were also buried in the first explosion on 19 November.
Rescue workers began by extinguishing a fire inside the coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases have been extracted, the abrasing temperatures inside the mine will begin to descend, Gary Knowles, the superior of the police, declared the journalists.
To hell with you, warrior!
Does the gore fit in the artistic cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn once again explores the boundaries of gender with his battle epic "Walhalla Rising".
What audience did Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think of shooting "Walhalla Rising"?
A Viking warrior imprisoned with one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) is released from his torturers and assassinates his enemies with almost superhuman struggles, sounds ideal for young spectators who seek bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to use brutal methods to kill and tear off his enemies the tribes of his living bodies when he is in bad mood.
On the other hand, Unojo, as it is actually called, doesn't say almost any word throughout the film and the other characters let themselves be carried as much one or two phrases or a couple of painful mortal screams.
Otherwise, they shut up and enjoy the beautiful and terrifying mountain landscapes of Scotland, which the builders offer to the Viking world of about a thousand years ago.
Rather ideal for grown filmmakers and interested in existentialism and in very calm camera movements.
When a film has several groups of recipients it is a penalty that cannot be ruled out at all.
Director Winding Refn considers his wildlings and trilogy about the "Pusher" drug-trafficking hair as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but he does not stoically refuse to make his works be for all audiences with something more of humor in the main current or something less of the brutality of the artistic house.
A brain mass and sprinkling tripes cannot deter most followers of artistic cinema.
Most of the fans of the action die of boredom, if Unojo takes a ship to Jerusalem with a troop of violent missionaries for interpretable reasons and an eternity in calm and fog is stuck before his team arrives in America and gets back to shut up there.
It is a pity that "Walhalla Rising" has not found a film distributor in Germany and is only published on DVD.
It is a calamity against the magnificent images, but also because, after the presumpious bloody facade, a piece of cinema is hidden sometimes exciting, which deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogues or logical action, everything is atmosphere, a feverish dream transformed into film.
And that's why there's no escape for the spectators.
Refn barely condescends a moment of relaxation and its glaciating images and the lugure soundtrack of trance makes him a nudity in his throat, especially the incredible hatred, which from the hearts of the characters goes towards him.
Only a young blonde, who faithfully supports Unojo, retains something as innocence, all the others are possessed by anger.
Above all, the hero of one eye, whose reasons are never explained, becomes at any time a warrior out of hell for enemies and provisional allies, possibly in the ambassador of the same devil.
He represents perdition, but perhaps only for those who are lost anyway.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, to be angry, altered and surprised.
An experience.
Mysterious Earth Movements
The IAEA nuclear energy organization has new indications of a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
The country refuses to agree on this subject until controls are allowed.
On the average night from 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four F-15 Israeli fighter aircraft attacked a mysterious cubic building in Syria.
It is located on the shore of Euphrates; the larger and nearest city, 30 kilometers away is Dair as-Saur.
Its name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), it deals with a reactor that Syrians reportedly built with the help of North Korea in the cube, hidden in a valley coming out of the river.
According to information from the US International Intelligence Service of the CIA at the end of April 2008, a current reactor is designed under the name of the proximity of the Kibar very suitable for plutonium production, with which nuclear weapons are built.
On the other hand, the technique serves only for purposes other than those of the 1950s.
The CIA showed a video presentation with blurred satellite images.
They showed with a computer animation where the reactor components were before destruction, which was a small copy of the North Korean model of Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
They also taught photographs showing the building from nearby or from the inside.
The reactor was running a short time ago, he says, but it was not yet equipped with fuel bars.
Today, three years later the bombing, is hardly better known than by then, the puzzles became bigger over time.
The former president of the United States, George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that before the attack the CIA was totally sure that the Syrians had built a reactor at the Kibar, but that he saw little sign that there was a "nuclear weapons program" in the country.
In Europe, several secret service agents prefer to be even more cautious and speak only of a "supposed reactor", although they consider the CIA's presentation "pleasible".
They lack solid evidence, as well as IAEA.
When he was asked how certain it was to have in front of a reactor, a senior UN diplomat responded in summer in a stony manner that the IAEA has “sufficient material to have questions”.
The Syrians quickly disposed of the rubble of the alleged "unused military building" and swept the ground into consciousness.
However, in June 2008, an IAEA team under the command of former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of uranium in el-Kibar, which had been manufactured by people.
In addition, the IAEA obtained satellite imagery about a Member State, from commercial sellers just after the attack, which must have a higher information value than the CIA presented.
However, these photographs did not reach the market because an unknown customer, perhaps Israel, bought them exclusively.
That is why the IAEA cannot verify its authenticity independently.
Syria always implied that it had never had a secret nuclear program or built any reactors.
Uranium came from Israeli weapons, explained Damascus.
The IAEA rejected it as inverosimil after the particle analysis.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss the matter, as well as satellite images.
In addition, the controllers are prohibited by a second inspection in the-Kibar and the entrance to the ruins of the bombed building.
Israel also keeps a strict silence.
"We will never comment," Ehud Olmert, prime minister in office at the time of the attack, recently confirmed the official position.
Thus, the investigation of the case has not been successful since June 2008 and "has gradually turned into a serious credibility problem for the authorities", as a high-ranking Western diplomat corresponds to a place in the IAEA in Vienna, there is finally a serious breach of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Atomic Weapons, for which the IAEA is monitoring.
The IAEA considers three more teams as the key to progress in the clarification, which must be "in functional connection" with the alleged reactor, and others such as these still exist.
Inspectors have not publicly made known to the point of which equipment they are dealing with, what functions they have, or whether they seem suspicious.
According to the newspaper Süddeutschen Zeitung, the IAEA has designated Marj as an insider, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, a new derivative of the proximity of the cities in question.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these sites and located a building complex near Masyaf with satellite imagery, which is most likely one of the suspicious objects.
It is likely to be located on or immediately next to a military base, and Syria thus prohibits entry to the three locations of the IAEA.
In Vienna it is said that Syrians fear a record that the United States has requested the IAEA to spy on military plants.
Nuclear detectives were alerted to the teams thanks to warnings from the U.S. secret service.
Through satellite photographs, the IAEA has evidence that material is moved between the three locations and the cube to the Euphrates shore.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the teams may be "related to fuel production".
But there is no "indication of sensitive activities", no enrichment of uranium or reconditioning; processes that are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is operated with uranium that is not enriched.
Where uranium should come from and where plutonium should subsequently be separated for bombs, for these central questions there are, at best, plausible assumptions.
There are also no doubts as to whether the ruins, the valuable tracks that can be recovered, are located in all three places.
As the hundreds of loads of ground trucks disappeared, no one has information about where the debris remains.
The OIAE considers the al-Tibni salt mine unlikely, located a few kilometres from El-Kibar to the other part of the Euphrates, which the Syrians recognized in 1998 for its fitness as an area for radioactive waste.
Recently, Robert Kelly, the former IAEA inspector, related her to the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the prestigious magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
But photos from the orbit show that the Syrians made land movements in the three suspected suspicious places and eliminated large containers after the IAEA requested entry.
It can be random but it just helps to dissipate suspicion.
In addition, in the diplomatic sector, it is said that the IAEA has used a few months to develop an inspection plan there, which the Syrians allowed, to maintain the possible military secret, only the deployment shows the magnitude of inspector interest.
Meanwhile, Damascus also criticises this proposal.
The Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago reassured that the reactor was already destroyed, so the matter has not been very urgent, for a couple of months now, Glyn Davies, a type of US ambassador, scolds the so-called exceptional inspections, one of the most rigorous means that the Vienna nuclear authorities have to establish controls.
Yukiya Amano, the director of the IAEA, who must propose these inspections, has spoken of "an option to which I am open in the future", but still hesitates.
This path is very risky: For that purpose most of the IAEA governing council is needed, and some of the 35 countries represented there are not exactly anxious for a climb.
On the other hand, as one diplomat reflected, "And what if they don't find anything at the end?"
Love in War Times
There have been problems since Angelina Jolie started in summer with the direction of her debut still unnamed.
She herself has written the script, a story of love between a Bosnian and a Serbian.
You don't know much more about it, but this is enough for the agitation.
Rumor is very persistent, the Muslim woman fell in love with her Serbian rapist during the war in Yugoslavia.
Bosnian women's associations have protested rapidly, and at the last moment they moved some planned shooting days in Sarajevo to Hungary.
The film has been filmed in Hungary and post-production, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hassecic of the women's organization of war victims wrote to the UN High Commissioner, UNHCR, by Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, informed a Bosnian newspaper, Jolie is the Ambassador of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
She's not a diplomat, women offered her a meeting weeks ago in Hungary that she refused.
The meeting took place in Bosnia, Hassecic says.
There are no love stories given in the rape camps, and Jolie's position on this is sufficient for the victims on the script.
His organization, in agreement with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, has recommended that Jolie be removed as Ambassador, the Guardian reports.
But what exactly did Jolie write for the scenes?
The ministry of Bosnian culture that read the script, awarded after a strip and softened a recording permit in Sarajevo, is not entirely clear why Jolie was not in spite of everything.
The young author reiterates that she does not pursue political purposes with her film, is introduced with great effort into the Yugoslav conflict, wants to show the horrible consequences of the war and give voice to all the parties involved.
Its content is still imprecise.
In the network there is a second synopsis of the film that sounds quite different: lovers were together before the beginning of the war and meet again when she, a Muslim Bosnian, is deported to a Serbian field in which he works as a guard.
What sounds significantly different is the "victim variant of rape is in love with torturer."
It is certain that Jolie's film really starts before the war.
The pressure on her, Jolie says, is "unfair and based on misinformation."
They can now achieve peace with Hollywood hackers: While the script continues on the network illegally, like many others before.
Nothing like far away from here
This afternoon is finally good again for the Irish.
No traces of distress
On the other hand, the home team dominates its customers in Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans shout with joy as they pull the loud music, hit the floor with their feet.
The Bailey club vibrates in the Southerish Cork, because the players throw themselves, and find, pingpong balls to the beer glasses from a distance of three meters
The strange show is called "Beerpong", and the prize for the winner is 500 euros plus a couple of plane tickets to Las Vegas for the World Beerpong Championship in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy, this out-of-the-way drinking game and the discreet computer doesn't actually make good hands.
And the 26-year-old tries to have fun with that, get distracted from the fulming question, what the future will come for him.
The fun in Las Vegas is not in your plans, in January you will have a personal interview in New Zealand.
"I have a bad feeling," he says.
"It's too far from home and I still don't have a job there."
At least: His girlfriend is waiting for him in Auckland, "from one shot he got the work of his dreams as a event manager, perhaps a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Because of the bad prospects at home, two of Tanners' three brothers have already sought luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sidney, his brother Colin is currently working as an IT consultant in London.
Young people leave: There are many families on the island like the Tanners.
100,000 Irish people will leave the country in the near future, predict economic experts and the Dublin ESRI social research institute.
By 2015 there are 200,000 migrants.
A great loss for this small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants.
The forecasts are confirmed, there is a wave of migration comparable to that of the island in the 1980s.
After a decade of progression that brought great well-being to the Irish, melancholy is now spreading.
The economic crisis is especially confusing for young, well-trained Irish people, for whom everything has so far been up.
The loss of employment and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone needs money in abundance.
But three out of ten men and women under the age of 30 are unemployed.
In the Irish Times there are letters to the director in mass of young emigrants, who complain that, "In Ireland, everything is sunk."
"There should be a uprising against politicians and bankers, but who can, goes and loses our country and thus a whole generation."
"The last one to close the door."
Leanne Caulfield, a law student and president of the Irish student union, sees a dark future emerge because the government is only involved in assembly and no longer offers prospects for the future to young people.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they don't have strategies to achieve new jobs," says the 20-year-old girl.
Notice how your peers go from unrecommendated practices to the following.
His greatest concern, he explains, is to have to emigrate in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
People like Stephen McLarnon try to look at this topic positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a fair that offers a service around the topic of working abroad.
"For those who start to work, doing so abroad is an excellent opportunity, the first steps to lead your career," the manager says.
On your website you will find pictures of a guy surfing in Australia and other snowboarding in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not like doing it in the galleries, but it brings freedom and fun.
For half a year, Sean O'Donovan has known what it's like to build something somewhere else.
Since there was nothing to be done for the 29-year-old engineer, he is currently working with 15 Irish fellow construction workers in Germany.
Now they're raising a fashion store in Gelsenkirchen.
In January he went to Hannover or Berlin, to the next project.
O'Donovan only sees his country a few times because he works extra hours to be able to pay a credit to his home in Ireland.
"The situation is a little crazy," he says, as it was a long time ago when he stepped on the threshold of his house.
"They make money in Germany for a house in Ireland, where I'm never that good."
He laughs a bit embarrassed and goes for frozen rooms.
The small house is in an elegant residential area with careful gardens in front of the houses, at the entrance are parking large and expensive cars.
O'Donovan bought the house together with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros, 100 per cent financed by credit.
"It was crazy times, there was easy money without many questions," he says.
Are you afraid to fail with credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, serves more hot tea and says, "I don't have kids to feed and I'm young; if everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch."
The civil engineer doesn't like the complaints he often hears at the moment.
"No one should go hungry, our situation is not, with much difference, as dramatic as in times past here on the island," he says.
"Working a season abroad is not the worst thing that can happen, perhaps we feel for the first time as Irish."
He laughs and tells about his father, that in the last great economic crisis he went to England.
"After seven years he returned and life continued in Ireland, very simple."
Cian Tanner likes these ideas.
Leave the future pending and simply see what life is like elsewhere.
He worked a couple of years in London, and why wouldn't he and his girlfriend do well in New Zealand?
But in these days there is one thing that worries him of overbearing: the celebration of his 27th birthday in Dublin Friday.
I'm afraid I can degenerate into a farewell party.
"Only, not too much emotions," he says and gives a great drink to his beer.
"Laughing, sounds very distressing."
"We better call it a party to go, very relaxed, with a couple of friends, a couple of drinks, a couple of games."
The democratic routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to grow, as well as support for private companies.
Crime generates greater concern than unemployment.
Moreover, in much of the region, Brazil is seen as a country more influential than the United States.
These are some of the findings of the last Latinobarometer survey conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
As the survey has been regularly conducted since 1995, it is possible to monitor changes in attitudes in the region.
The results of this year's survey, held in September and early October, highlight two related issues.
The first is the relatively lively mood reigning in Latin America.
The second is the increasing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased considerably in several countries on the Pacific Coast of South America (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has reached an average of 6 per cent annually since 2002, democracy support has increased from a reduced of 40 per cent in 2005 to 61 per cent this year.
It also grew up in Mexico, where the economy recovered after a major decline in production last year.
However, only half of the respondents from Mexico and Brazil, the two most populated countries in the area, are convinced Democrats, which lowers the regional average (see Figure 2).
About 44 per cent of respondents in the region expressed satisfaction with the way democracy works in practice in their country, the same figure as last year, but considerably more than 25 per cent registered in 2001 (Graph 3).
About 34 per cent said they trusted the Congress of their country and 45 per cent in their Government, the same amount as last year in both cases, but considerably higher in relation to 2003 (17 per cent and 24 per cent, respectively).
A decade ago, economic turbulence in Latin America seriously affected the support of democracy.
The fact that it was maintained during the global financial crisis was likely due to the fact that many Latin American countries were only affected by a brief recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
Furthermore, the existence of a stronger social security network has helped to protect the poorest.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty only marginally increased in 2009 and that it has been reduced again this year, to 32 per cent.)
However, the mood varies considerably from country to country (see Figure 4).
The good economic performance of Brazil and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is reflected in a general sense of progress.
That feeling is less common in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more severe and violent crimes have increased.
For the second time since the start of the surveys, more polled in Latin America mention crime, rather than unemployment, as the most serious problem their country faces (see Figure 5).
About 31 per cent claims that, whether they or a close relative, they have been victims of crime in the past year, a figure that has been reduced since 38 per cent of last year and that is the lowest percentage since 1995.
The most positive economic performance is reflected in increased support for private companies and the market economy: about 71 per cent of respondents in the region claim that private enterprises are essential for development, while in 2007 only 56 per cent (see Figure 6).
About 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow your country to develop, compared to 47% last year.
It is interesting that 62% of respondents in Venezuela feel the same way (and 80% supports private companies), although its leftist president, Hugo Chávez, is expropriating numerous private companies.
Brazil is the country that exercises greater leadership in the region, as indicated by 19 per cent of respondents (compared to 18 per cent last year), followed by the United States (9 per cent, same as last year) and Venezuela (9 per cent compared to 11 per cent a year ago).
However, the United States is considered the country most influential by respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, while Venezuela holds this title in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Elections to Waste
No one expected the general elections held on 28 November in Haiti to be perfect.
However, they went far worse than foreigners were afraid to help the country to recover from its problems.
Votes were introduced in the polls, some people voted several times, papers shot in the sewers, destroyed electoral schools and acts of intimidation.
The electoral schools opened with hours of delay.
Many Haitians, including groups displaced by the January earthquake, roamed the area trying to find out where they had to vote.
Some of them, in the end, were defeated.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several of the most popular, denounced fraud and called for the annulment of the elections.
Protests, some of them violent, spread throughout the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the highest-ranking United Nations official in Haiti, stated that they were "a relatively good election in many respects."
The observers for the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community said, with caution, that "we do not believe that these irregularities, however serious they may be, necessarily invalidate the process."
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, which according to its opponents is committed to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, should announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The shift is expected to take place in January.
Not all hopes for elections have yet been lost.
The two main opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rapper, and Mirlande Manigat, a former lady, withdrew their initial request requesting the invalidation of the vote.
But problems can still arise if the electoral authority declares that Mr Célestin, who has little support, if any, has passed to the second round.
Considering that the cholera epidemic drags the country and more than one million earthquake survivors continue to live in shops, great abstention is expected.
At the time, many Haitians wanted to vote, but did not succeed because of a lack of organization.
About 250,000 identity papers, required to vote, had not yet been distributed shortly before the elections.
There's a lot at stake.
Aid donors consider that the choice of a popular and legitimate government is an essential step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And as it has become apparent, Haitians think so too.
Moving from dots to center
In the weeks that have passed since she lost her husband, Cristina Fernández, the president of Argentina, has enjoyed a great sympathy among the public that has increased its popularity rate by 20 points, up to more than 50%, the highest level she has recorded since her election in 2007.
Nevertheless, it may turn it into a successful campaign for a second term in the elections next year will depend on whether the clearly affected Mrs Fernández leaves aside the intransigence of her late husband, her predecessor and political partner, Nestor Kirchner.
And at this point, the indications are not conclusive.
Mr Kirchner, who was still in charge of economic policy even after his wife succeeded him as president, had the habit of developing budgets that undervalued tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential marriage to spend additional income at its discretion.
In theory, Mrs. Fernández's government lost its majority in Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided, a situation that has worsened after Kirchner's death due to a heart attack on 27 October.
Some discrepant members of the peronist movement in power have faced Mrs Fernández.
However, after some chaotic sessions in which one deputy punched another in the face, and other deputies accused the bribery government, Congress decided to reject the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue," the president said.
The 2010 budget will therefore apply to the next year, which will give the President an even greater margin of action when spending it.
The economy is improving considerably: it is likely to grow to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently 11.1 per cent, but many private calculations, in addition to the labour requirements of the trade unions, place it at about 30 per cent.
Mr Kirchner, who took power in 2003 when Argentina was on the brink of economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction their priorities, rather than controlling inflation.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, pressed the private sector and had INDEC, the statistical institute, adapt official inflation statistics.
Will President Fernández modernize these policies now?
He has convened meetings between the private sector and union leaders.
In addition, their officials claim that they want to limit wage increases in the year close to 18 per cent.
The economy has been driven by the high prices of Argentine agricultural exports around the world.
However, inflation has limited the momentum for growth achieved with a major devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps it is for good reason that Mrs Fernández is giving signs of wanting to restore Argentina's financial ties with the rest of the world.
At the beginning of the year, the government reached an agreement with the bondholders who had refused to resuscitation prior to the debt that Argentina had not paid in 2001.
At present, it seems that Mrs Fernández is about to conclude an agreement with the creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which she owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners always insisted that this would not involve IMF supervision, as is usually the case.
However, last month Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund will provide "technical assistance" to develop a new index of prices for national consumption, which seems to be the prelude to INDEC cleaning.
It is not clear whether President Fernández wants to continue in politics when her term ends, considering that she no longer has her husband at her side.
If you do, you will need to gain the support of the middle class, much of which has been tired of kirchnerism.
When the Argentines return from their summer holidays in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have fallen.
If you want to win other elections, you will have to decide whether you refuse or not, calmly, many of your husband's policies.
Mid-Hour by China
Taiwan's voters are slowly approaching a kind of closer union with the continent.
How does Taiwan feel about his big brother on the other side of the narrow?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70 per cent of the eligible, went to elect the mayors and councilmen of five urban districts on 27 November in what seems to be a wide-ranging evaluation by the President, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr Ma himself has become a champion of the continent's feelings, building innovative business ties, including a partial free trade pact, the biggest change in relations with China since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but gradually.
Although his Kuomintang (KMT) party ended up winning three of the five mayoral elections, he failed to obtain the majority of votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (PPD), which has been driven by total independence from Taiwan, obtained almost 50 per cent of all votes against 45% of the KMT.
If it were the Presidents, Mr Ma would be in trouble.
Since his election two years ago, the proportion of his party votes has decreased by about 8%.
For the first time, the PPD played with the KMT in the municipalities.
In the elections you could see the typical elements of the Taiwanese elections, including noisy campaign trucks and large agglomerations with banners and light girls dancing clothes.
Nor did the mysterious attempt to murder rigor fail.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary president of the KMT, was campaigning for one of the KMT candidates the night before the elections.
A man of the crowd shot the young man directly in the face, wounding him and killing a translucent.
The curious thing is that it has not been possible to determine whether a man intended to harm Lien or get revenge on the candidate.
In any case, says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PPD, the shooting affected the elections, sowing suspicions about the PPD and causing voters to bow down to the KMT.
Maybe the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was surprising that it was not the continent's issue itself.
Instead, the candidates spoke of public housing plans and job creation.
Taiwan normally enjoys its de facto independence and hates China's military threat.
Therefore, KMT often avoids advertising its links to the government in Beijing.
But this time also the PPD avoided encouraging the feeling against China.
It responds to the new awareness that Chinese trade is essential for Taiwan's economic survival.
For his part, Mr Ma claimed that it had been confirmed that his policy with regard to China was acceptable to most Taiwanese.
It is expected that the Government of Beijing will continue to bribe them with trade, in accordance with its strategy to bring Taiwan back to the grid.
China did not waste time sending a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
He would certainly also like to achieve political integration, but the first is the first.
The best thing is to wait for the 2012 presidential elections to do so.
In any case, the PPD has been reinvented.
Two years ago he was in a bad situation: his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was imprisoned accused of corruption.
The President from 2000 to 2008 openly urged explicit independence.
However, under the leadership of Mrs Tsai, a new generation of moderates has emerged and the PPD is striving to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai has been welcomed as a PPD candidate for the presidency, as has Her Tseng-chang, who served under Chen.
Now your party is doing all it can to prove that you can also have relations with Beijing.
Mrs Tsai announced the plans for the establishment of a group of experts acting as a point of contact between the PPD and China, provided that negotiations can be carried out without preconditions.
Mrs Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party represents a "trustworthy alternative" to Mr Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems furious about the change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he stated that PPD candidates had been better stopped if they had insisted that Taiwan was an independent country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatic, not to present himself to the Presidents.
Even without the intervention of Mr Chen, the PPD will have difficulties in choosing among its potential candidates.
KMT should also conduct a conscientious review.
Mr Ma's assessments have been poor, despite the impressive economic growth; the KMT candidates have not wanted to campaign with him.
Their lack of popularity seems to be mainly due to unemployment and the growing differences between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesman says he will restructure his office, as well as local teams.
The large PPD samples suggest that Taiwan's support for a rapprochement is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese consider economic integration with China inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a well-known columnist, "the point of no return has already been crossed."
Grammy nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is the surprising choice in the category of Artist revelation.
Act at the request of a president and possibly people will look at you.
Esperanza Spalding, 26-year-old jazzist and singer personally selected by President Obama to act at his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, was one of the surprises of the Grammys this year with a high-level nomination in the category of Best Artist Revelation.
Considering that Spalding has been a acclaimed jazz figure since his 2008 album, "Esperanza", the nomination gives what to think, but respects the rules of the Grammys according to which he must be an artist who has not pulled out more than three albums before recording the one "determining the public identity of that artist".
His ambitious 2010 album "Chamber Music Society", no doubt made a great deal of progress and, taking into account its light and pleasant vocal style, as well as a great skill with pop influences, funk and Latin rhythms, you can at least draw a distinction between Spalding and the path to the success of Norah Jones in 2003, the closest equivalent for Grammy voters, who have recently concentrated in the field of jazz for this category.
In the remaining categories, Grammy voters duly honored Vijay Iyer Trio's "Historicity", an exciting and magnificent record that was one of the favorites last year.
Iyer's competitors include veteran saxophonist James Moody with "Moody 4B" and techlist John Beasley for "Positootly."
Trombone Shorty, a strident favorite in New Orleans and regular guest in "Treme", from HBO, was honored in the contemporary jazz category, which for the rest tilts considerably towards fusion as in the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The wild punk of Darcy James Argue's Secret Society gained a deserved recognition in the category of great groups, competing against the great camera jazz of Billy Childs Ensemble and the ever risky Dave Holland, whose live album with his octet, "Pathways", was a great example of the Bajist's democratic leadership in his band.
Awards Grammy: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey in the best direction of classic albums
The nominations in the field of classical music for the 53rd Grammy Awards include a mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
The main names were for Michael Daugherty by "Deus Ex Machina", by piano and orchestra, with five movements, and Steve Mackey with "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestra of three movements.
Among the nominees with links to southern California are the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his symphony No. 4, "Los Angeles", a piece commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The Los Angeles composer Avner Dorman is also nominated for his Mandolin Concerto.
Classical music nominations are distributed in thirteen categories covering orchestra, opera, coral and solo albums.
The classic producer category of the year includes five nominees: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin, and James Mallinson.
The names for the classical music album are Bruckner by the Symphonies No. 3 and No. 4 of the Orchestra Royal Concertgebouw; Daugherty by "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey by "Dreamhouse" of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificum - the Art of the Castrati" of several artists; and the "Requiem" of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the opera category, the nominees are Berg by the "Lulu" orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse by "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho by "L'Amour de Loin" by the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin by "The Enchanted Wanderer" by the Marinsky Theatre orchestra and choir; and Arthur Sullivan by "Ivanhoe" by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
The composers named a Grammy by contemporary compositions include Pärt by Symphony No 4, Daugherty by "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze by "Apassionamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg by "Graffiti" and Shchedrin by "The Enchanted Wanderer".
Pärt Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 at a session recorded by the Philharmonic of Los Angeles, led by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The piece, about 30 minutes, is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" is nominated for the instrumental solo performance with orchestra.
The Los Angeles composer wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for her to be played on Avi Avi Avital, who played the concert with the Metropolis Ensemble, based in New York.
"He composed it with sounds from the Middle East and numerous scales and rhythms from North Africa," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Director Pierre Boulez, 85 years old, was nominated in the category of orchestra function, leading the Chicago Symphony Orchestra during a recording of works by Stravinsky.
Nominated instrumental soloists include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
The nominees as vocal soloists are all women this year: Anne Sofia Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category of classic blend, soprano Jessye Norman was named for his recording of "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The mosque proposed in Temecula obtains the approval of the ordering commission
The draft mosque for Temecula has obtained unanimous support from the local order commission after more than five hours of public testimony, often heated.
Critics attacked the project by saying that it promotes terrorism and bottlenecks.
However, committee members decided on Wednesday night that the new religious centre respected local legislation and would be impressive from an aesthetic point of view.
"Many good people came to show their support, both Christians and Jews or Baha'i, of all religions," said Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic center of the Temecula Valley, on Thursday morning.
"The truth is, as an American citizen, I am proud."
"Shows that justice prevails."
"The opposition is really minimal," he adds.
"Only they speak very loud."
"In this valley there are wonderful people."
The meeting began at 6:00 p.m. and lasted almost until midnight; most of the time was dedicated to people who interceded in favour or against the center, practically the same amount on each side, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The discussion continued on the newspaper website.
"The United States no longer exists", is read in one of the comments.
"It's another apes planet with Mrs. Libertad dead in the arena."
"America has fallen."
The plans for the construction of Islamic centres have also provoked protests in other parts of the country, including near the zero zone, the New York area where the attacks of 11 September 2011 occurred.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmush has reported acts of violence.
His congregation of about 135 families has been living smoothly in Riverside County for years, but he wanted a larger and better space than the warehouse that rented in a shared property with a water filter system manufacturer.
The new mosque of 24,943 square feet, with a Mediterranean architectural style, would include two minarets and would rise up to 43 feet.
It would occupy an area of 4.32 acres on Nicolas Road, about two miles east of the Chaparral Institute.
Opponents may still refer to the project before the Municipal Council.
An arsenic-resistant microbe poses the possibility of new forms of life on Earth... or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacterium that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients broadens the possibility of finding new forms of life on Earth and possibly on other planets.
Although researchers discovered the curious bacteria here on Earth, they say they demonstrate that there may be life forms without the main elements they considered essential.
"This organism has a double capacity."
"It can grow either with phosphorus or with arsenic."
"That makes it very peculiar, although little is lacking to be a truly 'alien' type of life," said Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report appearing in the online Thursday edition of the Science publication.
For a long time, there have been six major elements essential to life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
However, researchers have discovered that the bacteria, found in Mono Lake, California, can continue to grow after replacing phosphorus by arsenic.
"It makes you think what else is possible," said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
Anbar said that finding is important for the search for life on planets other than Earth, since researchers need to be able to recognize life, to know what it looks like.
The study focuses on a microbe discovered on Earth.
However, the call for a press conference to discuss it, in which no details of the discovery were disclosed, generated a great speculation on the Internet about the possibility of the report indicating the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
He didn't.
What the discovery "yes shows is that in other planetary environments, there could be organisms that use other elements to drive their biochemistry and that the set of "stand" elements that we consider indispensable for life may not be so fixed," said Charles Cockell, Professor of Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, in Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is novel because it demonstrates the replacement of one element by another in biochemistry and the basic biochemical structure," Cockell added.
The discovery was not by chance.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon from NASA Astrobiology Institute, who conducted the study, focused on Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are similar from a chemical point of view, so it speculated that one microbe exposed to both could replace one another.
"Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is similar to that of phosphorus."
"It can therefore be difficult for organisms to differentiate them."
"However, the arsenic is different enough so that it doesn't work as well as the phosphorus, so it enters and, by some means, calls the biochemical machinery," explains Anbar.
The researchers collected the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed them to increasing concentrations of arsenic, to which they managed to adapt and use to grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus, but showing that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that there may be a natural way of life that uses arsenic, either in other areas of the Earth or on another planet or moon where the arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, indicated that the idea that arsenic can be replaced by phosphorus is not new, but an example had never been found to prove it works.
The arsenic was more common in the early ages of the earth, he noted, so researchers speculated that the first forms of life may have used it.
"Yes, it suggests that there could be other means of generating life, not just the way life was formed on Earth long ago," said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Health Institutes.
The missing stolen dogs have been found in Compton
The two missing dogs were found in front of the Bellflower motel, according to the officers of the Los Angeles County sheriff on Thursday.
The four competition dogs, two Akitas and two Corgi Galises Pembroke, disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express truck in which they were spending the night, opposite the Bellflower Motel 6, as reported by the authorities.
Two of the canines recovered on Wednesday afternoon and the remaining two were found on Wednesday evening, according to Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County sheriff's department.
"The good news is that dogs are well," Whitmore said.
"They're in good condition."
"They came back with their rightful owners."
Whitmore did not want to indicate exactly where the dogs were, in which neighborhood, or the circumstances of discovery.
"An investigation is being carried out."
"We don't mean anything," Whitmore said.
"We're following some leads."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be found to make a comment on Thursday.
They met with their two Akitas in a county animal shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
Sheriff's assistants found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
According to the authorities, the Akitas (Trace, a dog of 3 years, and Didi, a dog of 10 months) had not suffered harm.
But Bunny and Peter, the Corgis that Rickard and Peek intended to exhibit in the local competitions this week on behalf of the Japanese dog owners, were still missing until Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in the city for the national AKC/Eukanuba championship in Long Beach this weekend and they intended to show Trace.
The other dogs were to show them in other scheduled competitions for the days prior to the AKC/Eukanuba Championship, according to Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops on the practically two-month tour of the couple participating in canine competitions.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked in at the motel.
Normally they stay in motels and park the van right in front of the window of their room.
They carried three other dogs (a boxing kid, a terrier Parson Russell and a Brittany, who slept with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and Corgis in the van because they had a thick coat and would be cooler.
They left the windows slightly open so the dogs could breathe fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the truck's theft on Tuesday at six in the morning.
Peek had said they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the Corgis, equipped with microchips to identify them.
Thursday was unclear whether a reward would be given or not.
The lion is ready to roar again, while the restructuring of MGM gets final approval of the court
After 18 months of confusion and uncertainty, MGM finally got green light to start again.
On Thursday, a federal bankruptcy judge in New York officially approved the "pre-armed" plan by creditors to delete approximately $5 billion in debt, driving the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to focus its efforts on the production and premiere of films and television programs.
Thursday's ruling confirms that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, so there are no other legal obstacles for MGM to reboot under the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become leading executives of what will be a reduced study.
Staff will be reduced from 400 to approximately 320 members.
In fact, MGM will not leave Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase closes a planned credit instrument of $500 million to finance the operations and productions of the new MGM.
The investment bank is currently syndicating the credit, which on its own is contributing $75 million, and is expected to be funded in mid-December.
The restructuring process of the study began in May 2009, when the investment bank Moelis and Co. was hired to provide advice on the management necessary to order their finances, while struggling to make interest payments for $300 million a year.
In August, Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former president of Enron and expert in the recovery of bankrupt businesses, known for his work on Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to solve the financial tribulations of MGM and satisfy the more than 140 creditors of the study, required much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, by the end of 2009 the parties agreed to put the company on sale.
However, the auction attracted a few bidders and none willing to pay the more than $2 billion that the creditors were looking for.
Before spring this year, he returned to the design table while the MGM team began working on a restructuring plan that, after months of discussion and internal disagreements, was finally supported by creditors in late October.
When MGM officially leaves bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper companies will receive multi-million-dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis and Co., who have already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies, which have been collecting $375,000 a month for their company's management services, will receive a "successful fee" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production in MGM, which premiered only one film this year, and gathered an annual slate of seven or eight films that will be released in 2012.
They also plan to co-finance two films based on "El Hobbit", along with Warner Bros.
The study needs to conclude a separate loan of between $265 million and $275 million to finance its share of those two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns about 18% of MGM's debt, had been trying to fix a merger with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, the recent discussions between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Tech Toys wants to keep your gift budget balanced
While the iPad is the main candidate to be the most wonderful toy this year, followed by, perhaps, the Microsoft Kinect video game system, both can mean a significant mile in your gift budget.
Consider that for the price of an iPad you can buy five $99 BMX bikes each, and a Kinect game costs the same as 10 classic jump strings adorned with accounts, or about 48 Play-Doh cans.
But there are ways to keep your budget for gifts in balance.
Recently I visited three national toy salesmen, Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholeese Club, to see that electronic toys could buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that the Moore Act has been working; this year's technological toy will probably have more power, costing the same and even a little less compared to last year's.
In addition, while there are generally fewer new toys with associated websites, two of the most well-known of these types, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And button-powered toys are increasing, as are toys with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise indicated).
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for 3 years and more) are pelt toys of the size of a guinea pig who sing a note when his belly is tightened.
A cleft is equivalent to a note, and a second claw starts to arm a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing in harmony.
Caution: Once you start to squeeze, you can't stop.
For song combined with dance, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, for 2 years and more) is the best option.
Taking on the Elmo Live technology last year, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays shift-change games like Simom Dice, and can make the lunar step, thanks to its innovative legs articulated with wheels with lock device.
Children who tested the toy used Mickey as a dance instructor, even though their parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 1980s, you can remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
He has returned (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for 3 years and over), with a bag full of questions letters designed to convert a car ride into a session with a self-correction exercise notebook.
If you are afraid to give your child your smartphone, here you will find three independent alternatives.
VTech MobiGo ($60, from 3 to 8 years old) is the cheapest and easiest to use, presenting a qwerty keyboard; although games do not teach as effectively as the Leapster Explorer ($70, from 3 to 12 years old), it is the first major point of the Leapster line, with a newer and brighter screen.
No version is compatible with old cartridges.
iXL of Fisher-Price ($90, from 3 to 7 years) uses an iTunes-type system to present games and ebooks, and has an SD card slot that allows you to visualize family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash (30 dollars, Hasbro, for 8 years and more) is a game of five blocks just bigger than a box of cerillas, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to put words in line by putting the blocks in line before time runs out; it is formidable for an improvised word-arming competition.
More and more toys have some kind of online connection.
Based only on their presence in toys, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child an online pet at Club Penguin, for example, you can get a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, ($5, from 6 to 12 years) that includes a coin with a hidden code.
When you change the code online, your child gets enough credit in the Club Penguin store for two items.
These could include wheelchairs on wheels or a Puffle pet toy.
slightly bigger than the pig in his toothbrush, Hexbug Nano (10 dollars, for 5 years and older) is the last in a line of button-powered microrobots.
The false insect moves quickly over 12 silicone legs that vibrate, in random directions.
It's fun to make a block maze to see if you can find the exit.
It's also durable.
Ours was able to leave the kitchen table and even spend a while inside our dog's mouth.
Promoting a more moderate side of order maintenance in China
As an urban sergeant instructor, Tang Shenbin marked the step in a square of the city, carefully inspecting the nervous people in charge, issuing orders in a low voice with military authority.
He wanted the women's members to be harassed, the corrupt police of China's urban order, feared and despised for their energetic, capricious measures and their inclination to violence, to communicate a certain impression to a handful of spectators.
"Sign!"
"Look out!"
Show them, he whispered, "How are the pretty girls!"
Four girls who barely passed the adolescence with white gloves and identical olive green jackets and tight pants to draw attention.
Four pairs of perfectly aligned black shoes.
Four elegant hats placed perfectly above the hair tied with blue and white stripes.
"Personally, I think they have a normal appearance," said Mr. Tang, disdainfully.
"The models are beautiful."
More than one government has tried to clean up the image of the city inspectors in China.
One city ordered all new recruits to have a degree degree degree.
The Guangdong Province changed the greyish green color of the uniforms to a supposedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan, in Central China, replaced the use of force by intimidating looks: in 2009, according to a report, 50 officers surrounded a diculto cart of snacks, and observed it with the frown constantly for half an hour, until the traveling salesman picked up his stuff and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, has chosen a radical image change.
Since 2003, the district has added 13 women to its urban police, specifically chosen for their appearance, proportion and youth.
The idea is to give the police to a softer, feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson would have to struggle to increase China's low respect for these city squadrons.
And for good reason, they would argue with critics.
Unlike the police, these officers are authorized only to enforce city ordinances, imposing fines and other administrative penalties.
But Chinese news media routinely portray a different reality.
In January 2008, Hubei Province inspectors shot a transistor after using their cell phone to film them while they dissolved a protest against a waste dump.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors was stolen and published on the Internet, in which it was described as effectively choking criminals without causing them to bleed.
This year, a janitor of Shanghai Sandias suffered brain damage after a kidney with five officers.
A video game full of violence, available for online download, presents to inspectors trained by Chinese who attack street vendors.
"Chenguan has left a scar in the government," lamented China Daily, a national publication, last year after another tactical controversy.
The newspaper demanded "a truly meticulous cleaning."
Sceptics say that the current approach is far from this.
After the district had requested eight new female recruits in October, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News asked whether women had real duties or were simply a stage distraction.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district's notice called for female candidates from 18 to 22 years old, with a good figure "and the five harmonious facial features."
They must have a height above the average, above 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1⁄2 inches.
Retirement at the age of 26 is compulsory.
Officials said that work was physically too hard for women over 25 years of age.
"His image is the important thing," an anonymous district official told Rednet.com, a website almost government.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates shall determine whether they meet the requirements, such as height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the temper "and inner qualities".
The female Chegguans are like florists, he said, and he added, "besides being florists, they will have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the district city administration office, is not looking forward to supporting that description.
But he noted that the high demands were standard in many Chinese work notices for both sexes.
Then comes the requirement of harmonious facial features.
If this means being wager, it is a matter of debate among the Chinese.
Surely the disabled or disfigured should not be presented.
"We can't let a lame person or a bum come to work here," said Mr. Zheng.
"Your image wouldn't be right."
Liu Yi, who patrols the Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old, with its colored cheeks and a subtlely curved mouth.
She doesn't think the accent in her appearance is sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy with this uniform?" he asked with a sardonic look.
His 21-year-old workmate Xu Yang said, "Our job must present the image of the city."
They do not oppose their work at a certain time, they said, because they have higher career ambitions than simply run away from sellers in the alleys where they are supposed to circumscribe their business.
Each morning, the squad faces about a dozen walking and cycling salesmen, trying to sell as many tofu pans or bowls as possible before being thrown out.
"Mr. Wang, you have to go."
"We've told you many times!" said Miss Xu as a salesman escaped on foot, temporarily abandoning his bicycle-led car with noodles.
Officials describe their duties as more monotonous than exhausting.
"This is more or less the same every day," said 20-year-old Huang Jing, who studies marketing in his free hours.
"Very routine."
One reason is that female officers lack the power of their male counterparts to confiscate salesmen's goods.
They can only threaten to expose the offenders to their male supervisors.
This tends to protect them from the sudden public demonstrations of animosity against bureaucracy, which are common everywhere in China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the provincial capital of Yunnan, were mutined after the false rumor that some officers were harassed had killed a seller.
More than a dozen police or police officers were injured in the night episode; 14 government vehicles were either shelled or fired.
For the time being Xindu has avoided such violence.
But calm is only guaranteed.
Only two streets from the peaceful Baoguang Square, where women officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered in a corner.
The officers had confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk instead of in a workshop, as required by the regulations.
The owner of the bike was screaming rudely.
The situation was stagnant for 15 minutes before the officers, with a bad face, walked past the elbows to their vehicles and quickly left with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, a 40-year-old coordinator assigned to the male squad, remained behind, with his white badge turned to hide his name.
Like female officers, coordinators, men 40 years of age or older, play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not taught to keep an elegant image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," said Mr. Li with total naturality.
"Most of the time is the audience that starts the fight."
Prosecutors will not hold charges against Senator Ensign.
Senator's lawyers announced on Wednesday that the prosecutors of the Department of Justice have apologized to Senator John Ensign for the criminal charges that arose from their affair with a former campaign assistant and their efforts to secure lobby work for the woman's husband.
The decision ends with the most serious legal threat facing Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was considered as possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012, until the scandal over his business had national headlines last year and damaged his career.
Ensign's office said he felt "certainly happy" about the decision, which came after an entire year's investigation.
The senator could still face a disciplinary measure of the Senate's ethics committee.
Ensign's lawyers said that the Department of Justice had "informed us that Senator Ensign is no longer an objective of his investigation and that he has no plan to raise charges against him on this matter."
The Department of Justice did not want to comment on the case.
The announcement was a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Department of Justice, who said there seemed to be significant evidence to indicate that Ensign might have confabulated to violate a federal criminal lobby ban.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents that were first released in October 2009 in the New York Times indicated that Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to get lucrative work through lobby, to achieve the silence of Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, on the Senator's affair with her.
Mrs. Hampton once worked as a treasurer for an Ensign campaign.
Ensign contacted several political sponsors to find work for Mr. Hampton and advocated on their behalf after they hired Mr. Hampton to lobby them, according to the documents and interviews.
Since Hampton had recently been an assistant to Ensign, he was excluded according to the law of lobbying for his former employer or the Senate for a year.
Ethical experts said that the unusual arrangement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, appeared in disagreement with the so-called "revolving door lobbying ban", which seeks to restrict former state employees using their connections to do personal business.
From the evidence that has been made public, "it appeared to be a prima facie case of a conspiracy to substantially violate the revolving door status," said Stanley Brand, a Washington attorney who specializes in defending clients investigated by the government.
While the Department of Justice officials refused to explain the reasoning behind the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said that the department seemed cautious in accepting political proceedings after several major setbacks to its public integrity section, including last year's decision to abandon the prosecution against former Senator Ted Stevens, in the midst of charges for misconduct.
Federal prosecutors "are clearly cowards," said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a defense group that brought several complaints against Ensign in the case.
"This basically means high-ranking government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," he added.
Paul Coggins, Ensign's principal lawyer, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a prosecutor from the Department of Justice on Monday and another call the following day, telling him that the department did not want to raise charges against his client.
Ensign's defence team had been cooperating with prosecutors in an attempt to persuade them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement on Wednesday, "acted in accordance with the law."
Coggins refused to explain in detail the legal arguments he gave to prosecutors.
"I don't feel comfortable entering into details about my discussions with the Justice Department, I can only say that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Elections Commission decided to change an investigation into a complaint separated by the ethics group, claiming that a payment of 96,000 dollars from Ensign's parents to the Hamptons violated the federal electoral law.
The electoral commission said it had no evidence to prove that the money was just a gift.
NV Energy is an important Nevada company that had long supported the senator, who got work through lobby thanks to Ensign's help to Hampton.
An email sent in December 2008 showed that after the company accepted Hampton as lobbyist, Ensign's chief of staff, John Lopez, contacted Hampton and told him he was "maching" the Ministry of the Interior on a matter of dispute.
Ensign also attended a lunch with Hampton and another customer from Nevada, Allegiant Air, and called on the transport secretary to set up a meeting on behalf of the airline after he had hired Hampton to lobby.
When the news of the affair first appeared last year, Ensign apologized to his constituents and renounced his position as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After maintaining a low profile for many months, two weeks ago Ensign told journalists that he planned to post a third term in the Senate.
When Ensign's spokesman, Jennifer Cooper, announced that Ensign was no longer the subject of a criminal investigation, he said that the senator expected the ethics committee to follow quickly the example of the Department of Justice and complete its investigation.
" Senator Ensign has a desire to continue his difficult work on behalf of the Nevada people," he said.
Cheshire's appeal will point to Twitter
There were half a dozen of them " chatting" in the ranks of the court room.
Every minute, they sent reports of the dreadful testimony via Twitter.
In the end, says the defense, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the process that approached the rape and the children tied to their beds in a house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, the process widely followed by Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of a family in Cheshire, Connecticut, is ready to reach an official end, with the imposition of the judge of the death penalty voted by the jury.
But Mr Hayes' lawyers have written in the court outlining the arguments of appeals that will probably be held by the courts for years.
One of the most provocative claims that the intense reports on the process, including the widespread use of Twitter by mass media journalists, created "a circus atmosphere", and such widespread and immediate saturation with exciting details caused public passions to have an inappropriate influence on the jury.
The complaint could force appeal judges to deal with the question of whether the new technology requires new rules in the courtroom.
"According to what I experienced during this process, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of the new technology in the courtroom is affecting the individual's rights to have a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullmann, Senior Defense Counsel of Mr Hayes.
First instance judge Jon C. Blue, of the State High Court, laconicly rejected the lawsuits in a ruling last week, saying that the media were "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury was carried by passion.
But it probably won't be the last word on the subject.
For decades, appeals courts have recognized that the coverage of celebrated cases can generate questions about the impartiality of a process.
In a 1966 historic judgment, the U.S. Supreme Court revoked the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, saying in his decision, in the Sheppard vs. Maxwell case, that there was "an atmosphere of carnival in the process" due to the media.
It is believed that the crime had been inspired by the TV show and the movie "The Fugitive."
Some lawyers said that the appeals courts that examined Mr. Hayes' conviction half a century later, might be intrigued by the argument that new rules might be necessary to control the form of communication from the courtrooms, something unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a general reason for concern about the impact of new media" in high-profile processes," said John J. Donohue III, a professor at the Stanford Law School, who studied Connecticut's death penalty and wrote a report in which it was said to be arbitrarily imposed.
Professor Donohue said that some appellate judges might be intrigued by the idea that limiting immediate communication from court rooms could make trials fairer.
The Twitter issue is just one of many of the topics outlined by Hayes' lawyers, who will probably be discussed for years, delaying execution.
Defense lawyers also claim, for example, that Hayes might have been harmed when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential juries, showing them scary photographs of the crime scene during the selection of the jury.
Some jurors have said they were appalled by photographs of the victims, 48-year-old Jennifer Hawke-Petit, and her daughters, Hayley, 17 and Michaela, 11.
Defence lawyers say that they will also question the constitutionality of the death penalty and maintain that the judge incorrectly removed a jury that had criticized the prosecutors, and that he had wrongly pressed for a verdict for his strange decision to order the jury to deliberate for a weekend.
The jury wasn't kidnapped.
But its arguments about the effect of intense process coverage can attract most of the interest.
They observed in a rejection of the verdict filed last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and the U.S. Senate.
They argued that the media constantly threw firewood into the fire of emotion on the case.
"The daily agglomeration of media tweets, cameras and reporters outside the court," the lawyers wrote, "it was something that was never seen here in New Haven and perhaps all over the state."
Your attention to Tweeter's coverage is controversial.
In some interviews, some journalists said that the complaint about the fact that the immediate news was more important than the reports delivered more slowly, was a ludicrous vision that would make the court's policy on coverage control weak in future processes.
But some lawyers said that the appeals courts were often attracted by the arguments about the adaptation required in the courts due to social and technological changes.
Hayes' lawyers are pressing for that claim.
In their writing, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court decision, which repeals Dr. Sheppard's conviction because of the process's coverage, and made it clear that they would require new means to require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents the Sheppard vs. Maxwell case of the twenty-first century."
Can civics hold a bridge to unite the divisions?
After a remarkable campaign for invetivity and negativity this week has triggered a bit of civicism in Washington.
Is it a pretense of genuine future bipartisan cooperation or an illusory moment before a quick return to partisan combat in the capital?
The Tuesday meeting between President Obama and the leaders of Congress made no progress on the major issues to be addressed during the outgoing session.
But as everyone says, it was at least a polite discussion of the differences of both sides, as well as a recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than being another empty episode to win partisan points.
The President's deficit commission's public meeting on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political differences that remain among the members.
It seems clear that close interaction over a period of months generated mutual respect that transcends the ideological gap that still separates members.
That is barely enough to state that a new era of cooperation has come.
Both sides are now in a trial period, testing each other to identify signs of co-operativeism and commitment, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters for a renewed partisan war.
The reason why the meeting on Tuesday and subsequent assessments of the meeting by the participants were made with a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too great and are very deeply rooted to suggest any rapid change in the climate that existed over the last two years.
Whether it is tax, expenditure, health care or social assistance, the two sides are in opposite poles.
However, the November election has softened the mood in Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed with respect to the way things are said," said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official now at the Centre for Ethics and Public Policy.
"They are inevitable after the elections.
Elections arouse partisan passions, which then fade away.
That's good."
On some issues, particularly those on the agenda of the outgoing meeting, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush's tax cuts are won at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of this.
Both sides want to find a way to preserve some or all reductions, permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, there is likely to be a commitment to expand unemployment subsidies, probably because the Republicans cannot make them believe they are in favour of tax cuts for the rich, denying unemployment subsidies for the unemployed.
After the Tuesday meeting in the White House, there is greater optimism for possible treatment of these issues during the outgoing session, together with the ratification of the new START Nuclear Disarmament Pact (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty).
But William Galston, of the Brookings Institution, warns that successful cooperation in the pressing issues of the outgoing session will not necessarily lead to continuous bipartisanism when the new 112th Congress meets in January.
On the contrary, he stated that it is very likely and even inevitable that a period of disagreement should begin.
"After the things to be done are carried out in the short term, psychology will reverse the situation to a confrontation," he said.
Wehner also expressed scepticism (which is widely shared) about the fact that civicism can lead to genuine cooperation.
"I see most of what will happen between now and 2012 as a trial for the main event of 2012," he said.
The reasons have much to do with the constitution of the new Republican majority in the House and the voters of Tea Party, who contributed decisively to its creation.
As much as Republican leaders are aware of the dangers of exaggerating their position, they know that they must try to fulfill their promises to cut the state's expenses and cancel the new health law.
These lines of support are already clearly seen in the initial reactions to the recommendations of the deficit commission, which include reform of the tax code and the increase in some taxes and retirement age, and the cut in expenditure.
Co-Chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have been responsible for one of the most difficult work in Washington and, according to their own assessment, the issue of the deficit on the public agenda has been brought to force in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18-member commission to publish their plan as an official recommendation, and they have been struggling to get close to that figure.
The greatest resistance is among the officers elected in the panel, suggesting that there are at least now few bases or wishes for commitment on fiscal matters.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between the White House Republicans and those of Congress.
The first will happen next year in the form of partisan shocks, when Republicans challenge Obama about the budget, taxes and medical assistance, followed by a period of increased bipartisan cooperation.
What would cause change?
Public opinion.
There is considerable evidence that, despite the partisanship of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties working together.
If the confrontation leads to a dead end, as happened in 1995, then both parties will carefully observe the reaction of the people.
Anyone who thinks he's losing will probably change course and look for compromise.
However, this can be an optimistic vision.
Partyism and polarization are now greater than they were in the mid-1990s and there seems to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and Congress Republicans than there was between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans at the time.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as the mere prelude to a more transcendental election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civilization that is shown this week can be welcomed by many Americans.
But this will require much more effort on both sides to find common points on issues that still divide them.
A filtered US document depicts Moscow as the paradise of corruption
The city's control is in the hands of a "cleptocracy," and leaves some of the bribes and protection money directly collected from the Kremlin, as reported in February by the U.S. Embassy in Russia.
It was reported that both the police and the Federal Security Service operate enormous blackmail systems, which helps explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses but also from organized criminal groups.
Each stratum of bureaucracy, what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called "vertical authority", takes its part as the money rises on the scale.
The note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published by WikiLeaks on its website on Wednesday.
The note is based on sources whose names have been censored.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow, and blames him for much corruption.
President Dmitry Medvedev fired him in October, but there has been little evidence of a cleanup since then.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns an important construction company, have consistently denied charges of corruption over the years, and he has won several libel claims on such charges.
In September, when on a Russian television channel he was asked about a documentary that suggested he was corrupt, he said, "It's crazy, a bitch, a nuisance."
According to polls, Russians believe in an overwhelming way that their society is corrupt.
But it is unusual to find the details explained in detail, as they were in the embassy report, and it is unheard of that it is the diplomats of a foreign country who do that.
"The direct links of the Moscow city government with crime have led some to call it 'disfunctional', and to assert that the government works more like a cleptocracy than a government," the note states.
"Criminal elements enjoy a "krysha" (a term of the criminal world and the mafia that literally means " ceiling" or protection) that transfers the police, the Federal Security Service (SFS), the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), and the prosecutor's office, as well as all sectors of the government bureaucracy of the city of Moscow.
"The analysts identify a three-tier structure in Moscow's criminal world."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The SFS, the MVD and the militia are on the second level."
"Finally, common criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a void in some areas, because the city does not provide some services."
The report states that SFS collects money from larger companies, and that the police target small businesses.
One source, said the report, "explained that Moscow's commercial owners understand that the best thing is to get the protection of MVD and SFS (instead of organized crime groups) as they not only have more weapons, resources and power than criminal groups, but are also protected by law."
"For this reason, protection against criminal gangs is no longer a priority."
The note notes that while the collection of money is complete, protection can be irregular; even those who pay are subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly find their businesses closed for one pretext or another.
Medvedev has talked several times about the fight against corruption, but has confessed that it has achieved little progress.
The embassy note reports on men taking bags, probably full of cash, within the same Kremlin.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev has to trust bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, director of Indem's group of experts in Moscow, in a recent interview.
"But he's a part of this bureaucracy."
"He does not belong to a political class, because there no longer exists a political class in Russia."
Without politics, without an opposition, without a separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
At the national level, Indem estimates that corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
In a recent survey on global perceptions of corruption carried out by the non-governmental organization Transparency International, the country was classified in post 154 (countries are classified at least as corrupt).
The revelation of the U.S. Embassy note, which did not occur until late at night Moscow time, will certainly cause disgust within the Russian government, and even though Luzhkov can be blamed for Moscow's weaknesses, it could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to argue that he is solving the problem.
Interviewed for CNN by Larry King, Putin suggested that WikiLeaks documents could be lies and reacted furiously by a revelation that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth of the matter is that this relates to our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic policies in this country," he said.
"But to be honest with you, we do not suspect that this would have been done with such arrogance, with such pressure and, you know, it would have been done in such an immoral way."
The veterans of the Red Jemeres forced to face the past
In a concrete, dimly lit classroom, with stained and bare walls, the director of the Anlong Veng Secondary School reminded the man that he had built it, the last leader of the Red Jemeres Ta Mok.
"Here everyone loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and worried about his people," said 42-year-old Mr. Kor Ma.
Known as "the Carnicero" for its brutality during the Red Jemeres government, the commander remains popular in this remote former fortress of the Red Jemeres in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructures, and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Red Jemeres surrendered to the government, long-sustained loyalty is finally being challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for truth and reconciliation allowed the victims to face publicly the people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed here a secondary school textbook that for the first time teaches the story of the Red Jemeres to the children of their former soldiers.
And in July, a joint United Nations and Cambodia court issued the first sentence of a former member of the Red Jemeres, sentencing the former chief of the known torture center Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these events, anxiety has grown among the veterans of the Anlong Veng Red Jemeres, complicating efforts for reconciliation and their attempts to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There is resentment and fear among the former Red Jemeres, but they can't do anything," said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Center, an independent organization that investigates the regime.
"For them, life under the Red Jemeres was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"This is generating divisions within families."
During the Government of the Red Jemeres of Cambodia between 1975 and 1979, they were executed or died of hunger, illness or overwork, approximately 1.7 million people.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrowed the government led by Pol Pot in 1979, the remains of the regime and its military fled to the border of Cambodia with Thailand.
There they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last movement that was surrendered in December 1998.
Like Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from their bases in the mountains and forests of western Cambodia, Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a peace agreement sponsored by the UN led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Red Jemeres fighters began deserting towards the government, culminating in the returns of Ieng Sary in 1996, and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had resisted, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the nearby Dangrek Mountains.
He died in a prison in Phnom Penh in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Without the support of their benefactors, the oldest Red Jemeres fighters fell into the absolute misery common in rural Cambodia, and many feel nostalgia for the movement.
Although a few Elite officials of the Red Emerson retained their local administrative positions in exchange for laying their weapons, lean soldiers remain poor and unskilled farmers.
"These people have gained little after surrender," said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which offers public forums throughout Cambodia, even in Anlong Veng.
"They have incorporated the utopian agrarian ideology of the regime."
"They were created without any concept to do business."
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Red Jemeres when he was a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle near Anlong Veng before dedicating himself to life as a poor rice farmer in 1998.
"Life with the Red Jemeres was good," he said.
"Your Mok fed everyone."
"But now life is hard because we have to self-supply."
The current court of the Red Jemeres has also caused concerns here.
Early next year, the court is expected to start prosecuting Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former minister of the Red Jemeres.
The court's mandate is to prosecute the main leaders and those with greater responsibility for crimes, but it has not said whether he will pursue cases in addition to those four.
This wasn't very helpful to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
The recent media speculation focused on 64-year-old Im Chaem, who was a district chief in Banteay Meanchey province during the Red Jemeres government in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told the Cambodian Documentation Centre researchers that she had supervised the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project in which thousands of forced workers are thought to have died.
During a recent bochornous afternoon, Im Chaem returned from working in the fields at his home on wooden pilots on a dirt road on the outskirts of Anlong Veng.
When the sun cast long shadows on the reseal grass, Im Chaem refused to talk about his past in the Red Jemeres.
She said that if the court called her, she wouldn't come in.
"Cambodia is at peace and stable," he said.
"If there are any more trials, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who deserted the Red Jemeres in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that there will be instability if the court pursues more suspects, although experts and historians question him.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But facing the past is just what Cambodia must do to move forward, said Chhang Youk, from the documentation center.
"Conciliation, according to Khmer, is to reunite the broken pieces," he said.
"It is our obligation to gather these broken pieces so that we can understand."
The centre produced the first text book approved by the government on the Red Jemeres, called "A History of Democratic Kampuchea", 75 pages.
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the secondary school history textbook of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages on the Red Jemeres.
As in most Cambodia, young people in Anlong Veng know little about the Red Jemeres, despite the city's connection to the regime.
Touche Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng Secondary School, said that the new textbook helped students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted with skepticism when he took the book home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the court," he said.
"They have suspicions because they are not sure how many people will be prosecuted by the court."
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the textbook and the court are starting to have an impact, he said.
However, here the Red Jemeres retain a powerful charm.
On the Dangrek Mountains, a road with too many weeds and covered with discarded plastic bags leads to a rectangle of the black hollin covered by a oxidized roof of leaf.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a lot of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a mobile salesman on the edge of the road, said she didn't know much about the man who was burned there.
"But he has a strong spirit and many inhabitants of the place go there to pray to him," he said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday, and later that day he decided to walk to the place of Pol Pot's last rest, where he would leave a handful of mature bananas in hopes of having good luck.
Belarus agrees to renounce its qualified uranium reserve for armament
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to protect nuclear material worldwide, the Belarus government announced Wednesday that it will renounce its highly enriched uranium reserve, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was revealed in a joint statement published after the Minister for Foreign Affairs Hillary Rodham Clinton met with the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov, outside a security summit.
For years, the U.S. government had been trying to persuade Belarus to give up its highly enriched uranium and it seemed to have reached a point without return last spring.
But U.S. officials told Washington Post that a couple of operations were carried out classified with Belarus in the last two months, to withdraw 84.82 kg of uranium qualified for armaments from a Belarusian research facility.
This prepared the ground for Wednesday's agreement to remove the rest of the material, approximately 227 kg, according to one official, who spoke from anonymity because of the confidentiality of the subject.
The agreement appeared to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit chaired by Obama in April, which excluded Belarus.
And apparently it was a good achievement to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit."
"This shows that this process is working," said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Society, a group that promotes nuclear safety.
Clinton said the agreement is "a very significant and important step" given by Belarus.
In April 2009 Obama promised in Prague to protect all vulnerable nuclear material worldwide over the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries to get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of the Obama Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko had stated that the nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have preserved highly enriched uranium (hundreds of kilograms of what is basically uranium qualified for armament) and uranium of low enrichment," Lukashenko said at that time.
"This is our raw material... we're not gonna make dirty bombs, and we're not gonna sell them to anyone."
"We use it for research purposes, that's all."
Belarus, however, approached the United States a few months ago, indicating interest in reaching an agreement.
The officials stated that the first task of removing uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated, as the material had been slightly irradiated.
Officials said it was loaded on a special train that traveled over 2,000 km to a Russian facility for storage and disposal.
According to officials, the second operation ended on Monday and was aired.
The U.S. government spent $13 million on tasks, and most of the money was used to provide Belarus with the installation of low-rich uranium research that is not suitable for nuclear weapons.
Andrew Bieniawski, an Energy Department official who works in the Global Threat Reduction, said that this was "coordinated and orchestrated with great care to strengthen confidence" that led to the agreement signed by Clinton.
The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies this year estimated that Belarus had at least 40 kilograms of uranium qualified for weapons, as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will try to eliminate its reservation by 2012, according to the joint statement.
The relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, mainly because of the harsh repression of Lukashenko of human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggested a potential distension.
It was stated that "while welcoming progress in these global security issues, the United States and Belarus recognized that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central theme for improving bilateral relations, and is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens".
The Spanish Government did not repair CIA flights
The Spanish Government did not repair CIA flights with Taliban prisoners and Al Qaeda to Guantánamo for Spanish territory, according to the US Ambassador in Madrid on a telegram.
This is reflected in the documents filtered (cables) by Wikileaks to the newspaper El País, where it is added that the then first vice-president of the government, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, requested that the Spanish executive be informed to "be able to demonstrate that they were exercising appropriate surveillance over the foreign planes that pass through Spain."
In June 2006, following a report by the Council of Europe accusing of complicity in practices contrary to human rights to a dozen countries, including Spain, a meeting took place between former US Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice-President recognized that the Council's report "has taken the Zapatero Government out of play" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"From Vega he stressed that Spain has no repairs to intelligence flights through Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" to avoid being caught off guard," reports Aguirre on a cable.
Also the then foreign holder, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish executive "wanted to give this matter the lowest possible profile, although, by being in the hands of the judges, the Government had limited capacity to influence."
For his part, in January 2007, Prosecutor Vicente González transmitted to the Embassy that he would not try to block the judge's initiative to request the declassification of the documents of the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Department of Defense on CIA flights.
"These reports contain no criminality or sensitive information," the Embassy explained after speaking to the prosecutor.
However, the US reflected its concern about the "apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" rather than the disclaimed information of the CNI or the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination among independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle the case discreetly between governments," regrets Aguirre.
In March 2007, at a lunch between the U.S. ambassador and the Minister of the Interior, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he told him that "although the Spanish judges are rabidly jealous of their independence and will do what they consider appropriate," he had instructed his collaborators "to avoid remarks of inflamed rhetoric, in an attempt to lower the temperature."
The Ambassador also expresses his concern about the PP's action on this matter.
"Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience suggests that the PP will not hesitate to capitalise on any indication that the Zapatero Government has tolerated or deliberately ignored US actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if these revelations have negative consequences for the U.S. Government," he says.
The Confessed Parricide complained about being a mother in the network of "above"
The young woman was talking about the boy when he was already dead and had a blog: "Terror to the Galicia"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" on the network.
With this nickname, which he used as a child, he communicated with a cousin and at least a friend; the two naturals of Noia, the corrupt people of what she originated.
The messages belong to 2008.
To understand them, it is necessary to know their sentimental life, that ABC rebuilds through testimonies from their relatives.
The 30-year-old Galician began a relationship in 1998 with Ivan Tuñez, an industrialist.
It lasted a year.
When they left him, she was soon known to be pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him do the DNA test.
He soon became acquainted with another boyfriend.
The elected was Alberto, a boy from Lousame, neighboring municipality.
He came to live with him for a long time.
Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to probe the labor market, the little girl stayed with her partner, who even came to accompany her to Palma for a week.
But because of the content of the communications, it turns out that his romance broke, that they broke.
In March 2008, she is in Menorca alone and writes: "Alberto is very rare and musqueate, because I've come to work."
"When I told him it seemed good, but of course, he now realizes what it is to be with the child all day and not to be free to do whatever he likes."
Then, talk about a message on the phone that you just received: "I want you to come back this month or give me an address to send the child."
She complains: "If you don't like me leaving the kid with my mother, I'll pick it up when I get back," she claims.
In May, he talks about the return to his people: "I'm going there this week, but I'm only going to be until 19, because I have to introduce myself to a job so that I don't lose it."
Make it clear that if everything goes well with him, he'll take his firstborn.
"He will be with whom he owes, that is, with me, and never in life will ever happen to me to leave him again with anyone other than my mother," he dubious intention given his bad relations.
In July, there's another post.
When you type it, the child, who arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, is supposed to have been killed on the 10th, is dead.
"César is happy on one side, but not on the other."
"On one side he's with me and he likes the place a little, but on the other hand he's going to class almost every day."
He's talking about a transfer to Mallorca.
"He will go there (the boy) to some summer classes, and so I save myself a bit of kangaroo paste."
17th, memories and complaints.
"A very big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he sent you not know what videos to email, look how when he wants to find me, he has to fuck himself."
The 30th, another: "The boy is fine, he goes to summer classes to learn Catalan."
From Victor, his current partner, there's one: "He's making me money."
On the internet there are messages of yours on blogs dedicated to anime and manga.
He even had one of his own in the MySpace universe, now intervened, where he was called "Muki the Excarcator."
"Terror in the Galicia (header)."
The last man who cohabited with her, guards the jury, declares his sorrow for feeling guilty.
He doesn't want to believe everything happened because he didn't tell him that he was a single mother.
Mónica entered the provincial penitentiary in Palma yesterday, from the centre of judicial detainees in Menorca.
The trade counsel, Carlos Maceda, explained that he does not remember how the facts happened, "and he did not intend to cause harm to the minor."
Before, he confessed that he had drowned Caesar in the bathtub and deposited his body in a suitcase.
The defense and the prosecutor requested a psychiatric trial.
The popular would win 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of the 28-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
Following the significant increase in votes and Members experienced in recent autonomic elections, the Catalan PP already has a view in general because, whether progress has been made or not, prospects are more than positive, as the number of votes that this training obtains in these committees usually double the number it receives in Catalans.
Thus, the Catalan people obtained 610,473 votes in 2008 generals, while in the 2006 autonomics the figure was 316.2222.
Last Sunday, the PPC obtained 384,091 votes.
If this trend was maintained, which has been nourished by a vote of the PSC and the loyalty of the electorate of the PP, analysts of this training have calculated that, if general elections were held, the PPC could go from 8 to 12 deputies in Congress, while CiU would also win four (now has 10) and the PSC would lose nothing less than 9 deputies (has 25).
These calculations would show that the Catalan square is essential for PP and PSOE.
According to popular analysis, ERC would lose one Member - now has three - while ICV would stay with a Member or win one.
But, if the electoral calendar is maintained, the most immediate appointment will take place in May 2011 with the municipal commissions, where the people can also be decisive at the end of the socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in their relief at the front of the Barcelona Diputación, one of the administrations that manages the most budget - 661 million euros for 2011 - .
Both nationalist and popular agree on the possibility that the PSC will lose the municipalities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where socialists would not obtain a majority or the possibility of resorting to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Given the republican debacle, it would not be inconceivable that this formation loses its representation in the Barcelona Consistory - it is necessary to obtain 5% of the votes - .
The PP has increased its votes in the four capitals and could be decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced to be able to play the role of returning to the Tarraconian capital, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP has only been placed at 500 votes of the PSC, whose mayor, Angel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they were found on several occasions.
People have also grown up in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
The PP is currently present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in the maximum number of populations.
The Catalan cell has facilitated thousands of passports to Al Qaeda
In addition to the seven detainees in Barcelona, there were three in Thailand
The seven Pakistanis and Nigerians arrested by police intelligence officers in Barcelona formed an jihadist cell, which, led from Thailand, facilitated passports to different groups in Al Qaeda, including "The Tigers for the Liberation of the Land Tamil" (LTTE) and "Laskar and Taiba" (Let), the author of the latest Bombay attacks that caused the death of 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interior has given great importance to these investigations, to the extent of ensuring that with the "operation Kampai" the international Al Qaeda counterfeiting apparatus has been "weaked" and, therefore, its operational capacity".
Researchers estimate that the cell, in the two years it has been active in Catalonia, has been able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were falsified and then distributed to the groups that integrate the Al Qaeda criminal galaxy so that their "combatants" can cross the European and other Western borders with total impunity.
The dismantled cell is not the only one that the jihadist network has operated in Europe, so that research has involved, in addition to Thai services, other European police units, so it is not ruled out that in the EU territory it will be carried out in the next days similar to that developed on the night of last Tuesday in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (Pakistans Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammadica Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested), another was developed in Thailand with the capture of Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
These were the ones who led the settled cell in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - part of it was beaten in 2009 - mainly robbed tourists passports that met the requirements marked by the so-called "World Islamic Front".
In other words, the documents should be on behalf of men between 25 and 45 years old, with a validity of several years and without stamped visas.
The research highlights that, at the moment, no data has been found linking the arrested in Catalonia with the Bombay attack, although the author of this attack, "Laskar and Taiba", has been one of the receiving groups of passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
However, it should be recalled that days before this attack was committed, from Catalonia they were sent through a transfer agency about $1,000 that were "invested" in the purchase of mobile cards that were then used by the members of the "command" that ended up with the lives of 106 people.
The police have seized abundant documentation.
PP demands Mas to park the tax concert
PPC leader Alicia Sánchez-Camacho had an opportunity yesterday to personally expose him to Artur But his conditions to support his investment as President of the Generalitat, identical to those already raised during the campaign and to sum up in giving priority to the recovery of the economy and dispensing with philo-superanist adventures, as is the economic concert that the nationalist leader wants to raise in the equator of his mandate.
The president of the Catalan populars went to the meeting of Artur Mas with the certainty that he obtained 18 deputies in the elections last Sunday, a figure more than enough to get himself to want, as the candidate of CiU needs at least one of the formations that will exercise the opposition to abstain from the investment vote.
A possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliances that the nationalists want to keep in Congress when general elections are held, but, at the moment, the talks that these days hold But with the rest of the political leaders are made in Catalan key.
And with regard to the president of the PP, to support an investment "it will have to park all the sovereign and independent speeches", as well as the economic concert - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the convergent leader intends even to submit to referendum.
Both leaders do have a common commitment to soften the political apparatus of a very inflated autonomous administration and the elimination of succession and donation tax.
The details of the negotiations on the investment of Mas will be dealt with by PPC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
But he has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a tough opposition - , Joan Herrera (ICRC) and today will do so with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Citadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidarita Catalana).
The geriatric claims that the deaths were not due to "lack of measures"
The owners of the center of Olot do not rule out that their cellor would kill more than 11 elderly
The managers of the geriatric La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) offered yesterday a press conference to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal conduct of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who was there employed killed at least eleven elders who were in charge.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, appeared accompanied by the law of the centre, counsel Joan Cañada, and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be to be able to make the charge against the responsible" of the deaths but "legality and responsibility force us to assume the procedural situation of civil officials".
And it is that in addition to the social prejudice that the entity may suffer because of not detecting in time the criminal activities of the cellor, the great threat to La Caritat now takes a substantial form of compensation that are already calculating the legal representatives of the family members of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé has confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and has since stopped killing.
The judge had already pointed out in the car that he ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former geriatric patients - that he suspected that in many cases no doctor was personally exploring the deceased but that, according to the age and pathologies of the patients, the procedure was dismissed by telephone.
Caritat, through his director, denied this end roundly yesterday and pointed out that "the lack of measures may at no time have been the cause of what has happened."
La Caritat's lawyer added that "in the case there is no single indication that there has been an unwise action on the part of any other person other than the accused himself."
He was named "Angel de la Muerte" and confessed yesterday 11 murders and detailed that the first crime committed him on 29 August 2009 for, a month and a half later, killing a second grandmother.
In this case he caused death by pinching him with an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime he committed by helping him with a mixture of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat points out that it is difficult to control the access of the center staff to medicines.
Insulin pins and sedative cocktails would have been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in his attempt to alleviate the suffering of the inmates, used to kill them.
But it will be the analysis that is being done in the laboratory that should clarify whether Vila does not lie and sought for her first victims a less cruel death or whether, on the contrary, she embraced them inside by reading them as she has confessed that she did with the three women who killed between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat they do not give credibility to the manifestations of the cellor, not even to the number of murders confessed, which do not discard it being superior, and justify their attitude in the different versions that Vila has given in his visits to the judge and in the little sense that he has to change his course of action after he has committed, successfully, eight murders.
That is why they say that they are available for justice to clarify the scope of this event.
The ECB is threatening
The investors reacted sharply yesterday to the Trichet threat that warned "markets should not underestimate our reaction capacity".
The peripheral differentials have closed strongly and the actions of the European banks have risen by more than 5%.
However, we must not underestimate the ECB's ability to make mistakes, and the euro has barely re-marked what is a worrying signal.
What happened yesterday is characteristic of an liquid market that just as it plummets is recovered but motivated by closure of short and very speculative positions.
The institutional investor will take long to lose his fear.
A month ago the ECB quoted us today to withdraw liquidity measures and we will have to withdraw tomorrow for four times in two years and the remaining ones.
The Bundesbank required the completion of the public debt purchase plan for ineffectiveness and elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures in the future and leaving only unlimited access per week.
Following the Irish crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures to be extended "at least until March" and to maintain the quarterly auction with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We also expect you to continue your bond purchase program and even signal it to intensify it.
If they fail to meet the expectations generated they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they remain obsessed with withdrawing liquidity measures, God will assist us!
Just as at their May meeting at which they claimed that they had not even contemplated buying bonds and collapsing markets, tomorrow the story could be repeated.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bauca on Monday and Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday the auction of letters to one year in Portugal has been very poor.
The Treasury only issued 500 million to 5.28%, versus 750 million to 4.81% of the previous auction.
Yet the rates in Portugal fell 30 basic points across the curve, clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment after the words of Trichet.
In Ireland, the Allied and Bank of Ireland hole figures have been made public.
The estimated figures are around 10 billion in the short term and another 15,000 potentials and have until February to obtain private capital or remain nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with the stress tests, the figures are assumed within the Aid Plan and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, on Tuesday, the Government will have to obtain parliamentary approval of its new budget and it has not yet sufficient support, so Ireland remains a focus of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated the tone of her speech to relax tension towards the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December in which a political commitment is needed to prove that we are a union and that we all play the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the rest of Beethoven's joy anthem.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity to present yesterday the plan of measures to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous communities and financial entities, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment sound to investors like the four Vivaldi stations.
The double effect Trichet and ZP explains that the Spanish Stock Exchange increased 4.5%, twice the other European Stock Exchanges.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Banco de España has been rapid and decisive and we are benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year bonus that will benefit from the Trichet effect, so we hope it will be solved with strong demand and help resolve doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain to ask for a Aid Plan would be self-immolation.
They would give us a line of liquidity we don't need, the Treasury has more than 40 billion in available liquidity than in March, at very expensive types and closes you access to the sine die markets.
However, the strategy should continue to be that of Caesar's woman, "besides being so, it seems."
Come on, we can.
The president of Eulen will challenge Vega Sicilia's board requested by her children
The time does not heal in the open conflict in the Álvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, the founder of the group, will challenge it by considering it as "full-law null", the judicial board of El Enebro of the next 16th day, requested by five of his seven children and in which they will try to enforce their majority and make themselves with the management bodies of the signature holder of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesus David and Mary Joseph are fine-tuning the legal battery for the new judicial chapter in their dispute by the control of the group.
The founder of the company's largest business services holding seems unwilling to give in to its dispute to be present in the government bodies of El Enebro.
From its board of directors, five of its seven children were disbanded and appointed administrators at the shareholders' assembly of 18 January of this year and whose challenge is recorded in the Mercantil Register.
El Enebro's judicial board for the next day 16, convened by the Judge of Mercantil No. 2 of Madrid, has reopened the thunder box within the Álvarez family.
The recourse to the judge to fix the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only legal mechanism guaranteeing the convening of the board.
The latest movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz, is described by David Álvarez as a "a desperate appeal of the applicants' five children to, through procedural arguity, in clear legal fraud and abuse of law, try to validate and sanitize the radically null assembly of 18 January", according to their official spokespersons.
This argument will be the basis for the Board to challenge it once it is held in the view that it is "nothing of full law".
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already failed to try for the magistrate to convene a meeting in June.
In El Enebro, the capital company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, the seven sons of David Álvarez control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the service group, however, claims the benefit of 51 per cent of the capital, according to family protocols.
This is the substantive issue that the judge should decide once the hearing on the application for appeal is held, for which there is still no date indicated.
Red Bull wins in F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens
A software design improvements in real-time cars.
Since Red Bull broke into the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this select universe of speed has been marked by surprise and success.
At first, no one took into consideration the options of a newly arrived squire and, despite the ascending path of the last seasons, last November, in the final line of the championship all bet on the success of Fernando Alonso Ferrari.
Without demerging the skill as a driver of the final champion, German Sebastian Vettel, nor the capacity of the Renault engine that propels his car, in the world of Formula 1 has become a legend the "secret weapon" that the multinational Siemens has put into the hands of Red Bull to turn it into a winning team.
This is actually a powerful process simulation software that the German put on the market in 2007 for far-reaching purposes away from the high automotive competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computer tool has been used to design assembly chains of manufacturing factories worldwide, power plants, high precision instruments.
The goal is to play, simulate faithfully the product or process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding errors and avoidable expenses.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi planes or Nissan's most famous utilitarian cars.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the industrial division of Siemens, explains that the use of this computer instrument at its Formula 1 factory has allowed Red Bull to design and carry out "in a few hours, almost in real time", the modifications, changes and improvements detected during the races and in the trials.
Russwurm explains that the Squires in 1992 had an average of 10 technicians on their team who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements to vehicles during each season.
In the Red Bull team today, 180 highly qualified young professionals are working, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyzing and projecting all sorts of modifications in the balloons.
Siemens's manager explained that PLM software is able to analyze and improve all elements of Red Bull's balloons except the engine, which is of Renault's entire responsibility.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
Changes can be brought from the virtual reality of the simulator to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
As the only limitation of this insanity of technological improvement is the figure of $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend at most in each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has set up the high-tech factory to design and produce its balloons in a town about 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings in which visits are restricted, especially for journalists.
Everything that happens there is considered "high-secret."
The staff for this task is 580 people, including their two pilots, the Vettel champion and Mark Webber.
Red Bull Formula 1 hero is undoubtedly the recent Sebastian Vetell champion.
Among the immense technological resources that the brand of energy drinks has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, there are other protagonists whose competition is invaluable and their notoriety is null.
The head of technology at the factory, Steve Nevey, says that five years ago it could be said that R & D advances in cart cars contributed 50% of the victories and pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have varied and technology adds 85% of success, while pilots contribute 15% of added value.
Nevey acknowledges that the Vettels or Webber will never be replaced by computer since "they are unpredictable gladiators".
HP will install in two years 20 own stores with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened its first exclusive collaboration store in Barcelona yesterday are its partner Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of the 20 businesses network of between 80 and 100 square metres that the multinational plans to install in Spain over the next two years.
The company will support this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centres such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
HP Spain's vice president Helena Herrero set an example of the remodelled shop located on the Gran Via Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom she has been collaborating for 30 years.
The US group has prepared a plan to locate 200 brand sales points in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes 20 Spanish establishments.
The first ones to open were Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, being the third in Barcelona.
Herrero did not want to reveal the following possible openings, although he recognized that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HP personal systems assured that the philosophy to install the stores will always be the same, supporting itself in a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The American group advises and manages the exclusive furniture design of the shops (with products that can be played interactively), which in Europe will have an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of staff in establishments.
Helena Herrero denied that it was a franchise system and pointed out that the exclusive network of businesses aims to "improve customer service and SMEs in the purchase, attention, after-sale and even packaging."
The Barcelona Store includes a space with a worldwide pioneer pilot program that is responsible for solving the possible problems of HP's computer equipment in guarantee.
An online service connects with a technical centre located in Maastricht, Holland.
"So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can sometimes take up to two days."
"This system is specially designed for SMEs and users, as large companies have already contracted technical assistance services," noted Helena Herrero yesterday.
Sabadell bets for stealing a million customers to his rivals in three years
More optimistic than other directors, Banco Sabadell's CEO, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be a tough year for the bank, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and vaccinates the end of the passive war.
In spite of this, it provides for a collapse of the margins of interest, which will seek to offset in part by rises of commissions and the price of credit.
Sabadell hopes to capture in three years a million private customers, his pending subject.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit the next three years and can thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will launch a new management plan in 2011 which will take effect for three years.
The aim, in addition to surviving without having to rely on the public aid of the FROB, is to win a market share with the capture of one million new private customers - 700,000 if those who can get out of the bank are discounted -, their large pending assignment, as so far it had spoiled SMEs and businesses more than retail customers.
This year it has captured 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share in particular is 3.5%, while in companies it is more than 10%.
Another of the bases of the 2011-2013 plan is productivity, or what is the same, austerity, with cost reduction as an objective, and whose challenges will be exposed by the bank when presenting the results of the exercise.
Few banks have dared to set targets and make them public in those days, as the financial crisis has shaped all the world's banking plans.
Sabadell, in fact, will close this year's executive Optima plan, fixed four years ago, although initially it was for three, but the market situation has made it an additional exercise.
Customers who let the savings boxes escape will be their main objective.
In a breakfast organized by APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a "hard and transcendental" year.
The executive, in fact, believes that the exit of the crisis in Spain "will be slow".
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create employment", something fundamental to the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And, although he believes that the passive war - which penalizes the margins - is shrinking, the price of risk premiums that are paying banks and cash for their emissions for liquidity are already moving to the credit price to compensate for the fall of the margins.
"The issue of liquidity and financing is structural, and will be a pressure factor on credit."
"We haven't closed the gryphon, but the differentials are higher," said Guardiola.
Banesto has already given Thursday orders to its network to limit long-term credit and raise the price of differentials - see FiveDays of 22 and 27 November-.
He also recognized that the banking trend now "is to rise commissions", but "there is a competitive framework."
The Sabadell Master Plan is based on organic growth, although, as always, the group does not rule out corporate operations.
Not in vain, he says that in Spain "greater sizes will be required."
"The coming year will move everything," he said.
He claims that the capital needs are "too high" and does not rule out any Spanish financial entity entering in red numbers.
It points out that the FROB can supplement the market in the collection of funds in the face of new recapitalisations.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, it remained important to what some bankers are already vitiating as a new liquidity crisis.
It points out that it cannot be issued, but unlike what happened in June, short-term funding can be obtained through rest, which cushions the crisis.
ECSC discards a second wave of mergers in the boxes
The Director-General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, ruled yesterday that there will be a wave of mergers of savings boxes and again insisted on the speed at which the restructuring of the sector is being carried out.
When it began the process of concentrating the Spanish savings boxes, several entities ensured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they would be reserved for the second round.
However, the Director General of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Funds (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, ruled yesterday that this new wave of operations will take place.
"I think the biggest part of the mergers has been made, the incorporation of Cajasol into the group of Civic Banks cannot be said to be a second round, which there are adjustments."
"Most of it is completely made; it may be that instead of 17 we go to 13 or 14 but all the major processes have already been made and guarded by the Bank of Spain, which has collaborated very much also," the director pointed.
In statements during a breakfast of the Association of Directors and Executives of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta has stated that the concentration process is being "as fast as possible, and we have to be very satisfied with how it is taking place in the deadlines which, not now, were marked in the business plans with the Banco de España," he stressed.
"Passing from 45 boxes with an average of 28.5 billion asset volume to 17 with 75.5 billion is a process that has no parallel in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% to make them much larger to fulfill Basel," he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a series of quite unlucky opinions about the slowness of the process" which show "a lack of seriousness and meaning", because "what the Bank of Spain does is to remember that we have to be within the deadline before the end of the year."
The Director General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in Europe and "probably" in the world, and attributed it to those who judge it a "lack of knowledge".
The Director pointed out that, within the current economic situation, "we can be very quiet" with the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, a system that has undertaken a "very important" concentration process and which "will be as fast as possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish bank was very well stopped by the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the German Red Line
Berlin has opted to remain in the euro, but has set the conditions for the whole of the Union.
Market tensions have led to a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has advanced further adjustment measures, from tax reductions to SMEs, regulation of private placement agencies or removal of the 426 euros of unserviceed unemployed aid, to the privatization of 49% AENA, the management of Barajas and El Prat airports and 30% of State Lotteries.
On the other hand, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of President Felipe González, has joined the criticisms of Chancellor Angela Merkel for her responsibility to unleash the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
Go ahead that Merkel's position is not a mistake in his communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another tumultuous turn in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what its future must be, which is clashing with maintaining the old traditions of much of its partners.
Faced with European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate on the three possible exits to the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, consisting of itself, Austria and the Netherlands, among other countries, while the south would leave the monetary zone.
The second, the recovery of the framework, although now it seems like science fiction, with a very favourable flow of opinion, is close to 50% of the population.
The third, a re-design of the euro, in line with the sister proposals for greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigour, fines for the transgressors, possible suspensions of payments from one of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and has been defined for a long time, so now there are no excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission were stimulating deficits, the German Government pulled out of the sleeve a constitutional reform to prevent them from starting in 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany believed should be done (plans of fiscal rigour and stability in public finances), and what its European partners, including France, were practicing.
The second on the front was given by the Central European country when Merkel painfully extended Greece's rescue decision.
It was already the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion and published it were very against the Greek ransom.
Finally, in the last few days of October, Merkel again emerges with a clear position, demanding reform of the Union's treaties, in order to make it possible to save a country and at the same time force private lenders to run with part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as it has precipitated the Irish crisis and everything else.
But its proposal, although somewhat sweetened, has been adopted and, in the coming months, we should attend the process of reform of the Union which will enable those measures to be taken from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that does not intend to cross.
And he is telling all of us that, although there is now a need to take measures with which he may not agree, from that date the former operation of the euro will have ended.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary area, in which the countries of infringements will be severely punished, may be forced to declare themselves suspended and, in that case, the private sector will also run with part of the cost.
Germany is pointing out that we must follow a strict path of growth with high savings and investment rates, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
Another alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, such as the one that has presided over Spanish growth in the boom years, will simply not tolerate it.
The guest is clear.
And it would be wrong for us not to understand.
It is not just a matter of restoring the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they're demanding is much harder.
And the worst thing we could do in these circumstances is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will make way for greater peace.
And let us take advantage of the window of opportunity they gave us, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also understood this and his double manifesto (the reforms promised after last Saturday's meeting with the big companies and the announcement of yesterday's new measures) suggests that, despite the criticisms of Merkel, the thesis that we have to put order at home has been opened.
But the red line that Germany has drawn there is, and it doesn't look like they're going to move it.
And, among the possibilities that are envisaged, that of abandoning a monetary zone that is too severe in poor countries, cannot be excluded.
Then Germany will always be able to tell us that he has already warned us.
Sports and fraud
Shots like those of Alonso and Ramos before the Ajax prove ingenious but not willing to escape a penalty.
The alleged hesitancy of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the match against the Ajax in the League of Champions on 23 November has led to the writing of ink rivers about whether such behaviour is anti-sportive and whether, possibly, both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is well known, in the absence of a few minutes to finish the match (which his team had already clearly won), the two players deliberately lost time to make mistakes to cause the referee to show them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid will now become the leader of its group, both players will comply with the regulatory sanction of the next league party, against the Auxerre, and they will be able to pass clean cards to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee has sanctioned the team coach José Mourinho with two parties, and with different economic quantities to the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances like this or similar is not a new practice, but rather frequent in the world of football.
It is so extended that it is part of the ethos, of the unwritten but then unwritten rules of this sport.
Part of the debate that has arisen in the reported case is that it has been the protagonist of a team of the Real Madrid entity (who in his anthem presumes of nobility and honor, and who has occasionally passed has fined his players for similar acts) and the orchestrated dramatization, apparently by Mourinho, who adds one more episode to his dilated history of histrian and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether that type of behaviour not expressly prohibited by the regulation contradicts the principles of sport, that is, whether these actions are committed fraud of law; for, in fact, they are actions that are respectful of the sporting rules, but seem to circumvent their meaning.
The issue goes on to examine the kind of damage they cause to the sports spirit.
One of the goods that includes the sports spirit is the physical integrity of the opposing players, an aspect that with these actions was not put in danger, that is, there was no violent game.
Another of these assets referred to in the clean game is to prevent the team from using the opposing team in an unfair way, which did not happen.
However, the paradoxical of the action of the Real Madrid players is that it did not suit what we normally characterise as a trap or a fraud of law, because its violation of the rules was not hidden to try to avoid the penalty, but precisely its action sought to be the most evident in order to receive the punishment of the arbitrator.
They looked forward to and gladly accepted the penalty.
Another question is what kind of advantage do the offenders gain from the alleged misconduct under review.
Here it seems necessary to note that the rival is not in a disadvantage or benefit from the same party, as the result of the action obviously means leaving the team with fewer players.
Nor is it a useful strategy for the next game, because the club will not be able to count on those players.
The advantage, of course, is that players will begin the next phase of the League of Champions without cards that may threaten their participation in a future game.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indetermination, because the team can be eliminated from the first ones of change, and also with this performance players perform a penalty match and pass to the second cycle of cards, in which card accumulation suspension occurs with one less than in the first cycle.
So, if you go rounds, it's not so clear that it's an advantage.
In short, these actions do not go against the spirit of sport, of which it is part to make strategic decisions that help to make the most of what the rules allow.
In the case before us, players did not act to avoid the application of the penalty (this would be a clear case of legal fraud), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without drawing the punishment or fleeing from it.
Although the border between engineering and law fraud is widespread, on this occasion I think it was a clear case of ingenuity.
The controversy, it seems to me, arises by two factors: because it was two self-expulsion and the way in which the transmission of the guideline was carried out to provoke them.
The damage caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not as ethical as it is aesthetic.
Offensive offers to capture Christmas dinners from groups in NCBs
The dictatorship of the calendar concentrates this year an avalanche of reservations for the 16th and 17th days.
They proliferate self-suffered celebrations by employees, who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the tower and the lottery, with the arrival of December also return the pre-Christmas group dinners, which continue to exercise oxygen balloon for the restoration and leisure of Barcelona, but which because of the crisis have led to an offense of adjusted prices in order to capture the majority customer: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros in dinners or meals, the entrepreneurs and associations of the sector interviewed coincide.
In order to end up complicated accounting, this year's calendar (at the fall of New Year's Eve on Friday) has concentrated the requests in the week of December 13, with the result up to the date of an avalanche of reservations for peak days (16 and 17) and only movement for the previous week.
As has already been happening since 2008, when the stage of thin cows began, there are many companies that have eliminated collective dinners by budget question.
In order not to dispense with tradition, many workers keep it paying for their own pocket.
Whatever the situation, one and the other demand battle prices, confirms the President of the Gremi de Restoration de Barcelona, Gaietà Farres.
The employer's representative, to this day, does not dare to see what this month's festivities will be like.
"People think about it long before they book."
"You want to get out but you have the alerts on the subject of prices," he points.
The business will be well "those who give quality at good price and with good service", he adds, and recalls that customers tend to go down a step with the crisis, so the band around 25 euros has become majority in demand.
A survey in various central establishments shows the collapse of requests for the night of 17.
In the Soteras group they indicate that there is a real demand boom for this Friday, with the claim to spend less than 30 euros, to what they have responded by adapting their menus to the juncture, with complete formulas of 25 to 35 euros.
In another of the most powerful groups, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Rita Hostel, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to more advance reservations, even since early November.
"We have done the impossible thing to keep the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes from 19,95 to 30 euros," they state.
In AN Group, which abandons El Mussol, Attic, Ququ, and up to a total of 23 locals, they remain optimistic after detecting an increase in billing since the second half and good, although concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources of the group highlight that 18 will also be a hyperactive day at the level of groups of friends precelling parties.
To its six group menus they have added a Christmas, with the 30 euros or more as a star budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend 10% more than last year in exchange for more details, such as cava.
They also see green outbreaks in some companies that reinvite their employees and feel that the volume of the groups is something bigger.
By patronal Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Leisure of Barcelona), his vice president, Henry Goma, is confident to start seeing the end of the tunnel and maintains that together the reserves are "enlived", although customers "negotiate at most".
Yes, the illusion for the festivities has not come down, pay who pays, indicates.
Pakistan’s Nuclear Program generates great anxiety in the United States
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at "a faster pace than any other country."
Wikileaks leaks confirm the link between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. Department of State filtered by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns caused by the Pakistani nuclear program in Washington.
Apart from the enlightening and juicy details they offer on the content of the talks and thoughts of the American diplomatic representatives accredited in Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between the two countries on atomic security, instead of increasing, "decreases", and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "at a faster pace than any other country in the world."
The peculiarity of the Pakistani nuclear programme - that weapons are not assembled but remain stored by components to hinder their destruction in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for the development in Washington.
This is listed by the Ambassador in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report prior to the visit of the then National Security Adviser, James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear installations to the territory under Taliban attack, the noisy dispersion of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials."
The high number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is considered, not only by the US, but also by Russia, as a proliferative and motive for keeping the guard.
"Pakistan has had to hire staff with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the drop in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who work in nuclear or missile programs," said expert Yuri Korov, of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, at a meeting with their American counterparts.
The most innovative of the documentation filtered by Julian Assange's portal is the growing cooperation between the US and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation issues and the high Pakistani pace of nuclear weapons production.
An embassy office in May, which qualifies as "frustrant" communication with Pakistan, argues: "Transparency is often non-existent; offers of help are not answered or discarded."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, National Intelligence Officer for South Asia, notes that "Despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster pace than any other country in the world."
Ambassador Patterson also asks Washington, during a visit by the Chief of the Army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to "make it clear" to the person responsible that "the Pakistani Army must end tacit support for terrorist groups."
To the hunt of the chief of Wikileaks
Obama appoints a senior counter-terrorism officer to avoid further leaks.
Interpol issues a red alert in order to follow the movements and locate Assange wherever it is.
Everything related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated maze where it is difficult to be sure of the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "localize and follow the movements" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest order.
Moreover, it is not new, but dates on 20 November.
And it has nothing to do with the last leak of more than a quarter of a million US diplomatic documents, but with the allegations of sexual abuse that Australians face in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks creator's lawyer, Mark Stephens, says that "the police know where and how to get in touch with Mr Assange."
It was the 20th day when the international police force based in Lyon, France, issued the order at Sweden's request, but did not reveal it until yesterday, after receiving authorization from the authorities of that country.
Thus, the 188 Interpol countries have indications of identifying or locating Assange "with a view to their provisional arrest and extradition."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, as explained by the organization, do consider the so-called free news network to carry out a arrest -- which must be carried out by the national police force -- especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, such as Sweden and England, where Assange is believed to be.
The movement has outraged Assange's lawyers, who yesterday issued a letter denouncing that the founder of Wikileaks, 39, has been willing to respond by videoconference to the questions of the Swedish authorities.
They also remember that Assange requested and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor's case, compared to the legendary Lavrenty Pavlovich Beria, head of security at Stalin.
"This looks like a hunt, not a legal chase," the missive denounces.
While the world is looking for him - and from Australia his mother defends his son's innocence - Assange remains in unknown place, but not silent.
On Monday he granted from an indeterminate location an interview to the director of Time magazine through Skype, a conversation in which he requested the resignation of the U.S. Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton.
"If you can show that you were responsible for ordering American diplomats to spy on the UN by violating international treaties that the US has signed, you should resign," he said.
His opinion was denusted yesterday by the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, who called the application for resignation "ridiculous and absurd".
"I'm not entirely sure why we should care about a guy's opinion with a website," CNN said.
Obama himself has commissioned a senior anti-terrorist fighter, Rusell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama's attempt to emphasize Assange's importance contrasts with the views that these days proclaim conservative politicians and commentators.
Peter King, the congressman who will preside over the National Security Committee in the lower chamber from January, has asked the State Department to consider including Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations "to intervene and their funds and prosecute anyone who has any contribution or assistance."
Further away Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, has had to retract after saying that Assange should be "killed."
"Obama should make it a target and use an unmanned plane or something."
Who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, governor of Arkansas and possible candidate for the presidency.
"Whoever in the government leaked the information is guilty of treason and anything other than execution would be too kind a punishment," Fox said.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with guide to Carod
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more pluralist executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to draw the enthralled internal revolt in the ranks of ERC, without the north due to the loss of 11 deputies and half of the votes.
The chairman of the party is aware that his resignation shelter is insufficient for the likes of the exile Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of this sector is as diluted as his own mentor today and that he can at all cause the headbreakers he had with other extinct currents.
For that reason, the leader of Escorra will try to win the new critics with clues that allow him to fight until the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national ERC advisers will be able to decide on their continuity in secret.
By means of cards, and not by hand raised.
If the Karodists want to vehicle a certain vote of punishment to the President, they will be able to do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the head of the row wants to avoid the image of division as much as the image of submission to his or her person.
In several interviews, he stated that he would not consider himself to be ratified with half another one of the votes, but added, without specifying percentages, that it would not be a good result "to the Bulgarian".
The next to Carod demands the president more than making his position available to the military, a gesture that is not valid when Puigcercós controls the maximum organ between congresses.
But if they don't have the majority to force resignations, they're going to try to agree with the executive on a road map from here to May.
To that end, they look forward to participating in the drafting of the strategic reorientation document that the management will put to the vote by the national council on 18th.
Its intention is to swallow Puigcercós in exchange for this one to promise to advance the congress in the fall of 2011, something that the dome already gives in fact.
The leader of ERC acknowledged that "polyphony" undermines stability and that its goal is to make the organization, once and for all, capable of washing dirty rags from doors inwards.
In this line, it is symptomatic of the article that the function advisor Josep Huguet signed on his blog.
Considered the ideologue of Puigcercós, the holder of Innovation has indeed given that the leader will be held "in exchange for various objectives".
And he listed five, of which two stand out.
The first is to "recompose" the executive to represent at least 90% of the military, that is to say, include new faces from the sector to go to Carod.
The second can be the great novelty.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquid once assemblage as a mechanism of operation.
He therefore proposed a reform of the statutes that would allow congresses to be held through delegates elected by suffrage.
Ending the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, has been an obsession of the Puigcercós team, who has already fought in this direction in the last two congresses.
In fact, the 2008 convulsor conclave left the responsibility of the management to review the assembly at a specific status reform conference.
This quote is still pending, as the internal tide of recent years has discouraged the issue.
Now, without sectors critical to the eye, it can be a good time to get it back and try to close it forever.
23 executed in November; 290 during 2010
According to the tale of MILENIO State of Mexico, a decrease of four cases was recorded compared to 2010.
During November 23 people were executed in the State of Mexico, four less than the previous month according to the content of MILENIO State of Mexico.
Among the murders are the three women and the finding of a couple of bodies encircled in the Mexico Valley.
In the penultimate month of the year there are 390 deaths allegedly related to organized crime.
Among the cases is that of a corpse found in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, municipality of Toluca.
The guy had at least three gunshots and the grace shot on his head in addition to his feet and hands tied with cable.
The next day, the body of a subject was found in a suitcase inside the cage of an abandoned vehicle on the street Mixtecas, in the Colonia Santa Cruz Acatlan, of the municipality of Naucalpan.
In the early morning of Thursday, scapegoats found a body with signs of torture and at least three lethal shots in the chest, on the quieto-Ixtapan quota highway of Salt, on the stretch crossing the municipality of Villa Guerrero.

A day later in Nezahualcoyotl, a 50-year-old man, he was killed with eight bullets after leaving his home to start garbage collection work.
On November seven, two subjects of 30 years, were finished with a bullet impact on the head each at the colony San Pedro Xaloxtoc, Ecatepec municipality.
In Chalco, with the shooting of grace on the front was found a man's body on a lonely road from the Colonia El Naranjo and under the body found a percut shell of firearm calibre 25.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the black water channel of the Playa Golondrina colony.
Emergency bodies conducted a thorough search of the other members of the body, however they were not located.
Tepotzotlan neighbors warned about the discovery of a corpse found in the Peña Colorada paraje, which was tied from the hands back and with the head bandaged.
The man had a gunshot wound on his neck.
The execution of two men was reported half a month, who were wrapped in blankets and abandoned in the cage of a vehicle on the streets of the hamlet Villas de la Hacienda in the municipality of Atizapán de Zaragoza, along with the victims were also discovered two messages of warnings of death.
One day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony, in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby colony was found wrapped in a black plastic bag the rest of the body with a message signed by El Incorrigible.
On the 17th, wrapped in caves, two women were found lifeless in the township Zoquiapan in the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the following morning a man's body was located in Huixquilucan who was wrapped in a yellow cabilla with blue, allegedly identified with the name of Mario Ríos according to a message that his executioners left next to him.
In Ixtapaluca, with gunshots on the neck, was found the lifeless body of a woman in the village of San Francisco Acuautla.
In the women's skin tattoos of the Holy Death were detected, as well as necklaces with their image.
In the last part of the month, the body of a man was found on a car in the municipality of Zinacantpec with at least three bullet impacts and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the corpses of a couple of men with their heads stuck and a message were found in the community of Piedra Bridge, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies there was a message allegedly signed by a criminal organization that said, "This happens to those who don't align themselves."

On the last day of the month the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz, and Nezahualcoyotl.
The first of them was beheaded in the colony Cuchilla Ancón and was wrapped in black plastic bags, bound with cinnamon tape and next to a message; while the second was tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of the Colonia Juárez.
Next to him the agents found a postcard with a message.
Keeps China’s objectives to reduce greenhouse gases
The representative of that country at COP16 assured him that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and detailed its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 by 40-45 per cent.
China maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, said Su Wei, the representative of that country at COP16.
In its first public appearance at the 16 Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), His Wei assured that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and to restore its industry.
In fact, he stated, over the past four years, his country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, it made it clear that China will not change its objectives, but will continue to work together with the international community in that regard.
It noted that the Chinese climate change strategy is divided into four sections: dialogue; capacity building; institution building and support for pilot programmes.
In all these headings progress has been made, including the adoption last year of a new Energy Act, which reflects the objectives of reducing gas emissions, he explained.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, federal authorities have been working in coordination with state and local authorities to achieve energy saving, efficient energy use and emission reduction targets.
In addition, various multi-year plans, both financed by the Chinese government and by Governments of other countries, were under way or have already been completed.
For example, he referred to the Energy Efficiency Programme, which had been implemented over the past five years and received investments from the United Nations (UN), the Government and the private initiative.
A provincial climate change project is also under way, another for changing incandescent focus by savers and one more mitigation and adaptation, he said.
At the same table, Martin Krol, a scientific adviser to the government of that country on climate change, assured that China's efforts have been greater than generally thought.
For example, it stated that the per capita emission of greenhouse gases in China is six tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9 percent of the historical contribution to pollution.
It has also made unprecedented efforts on energy use, such as increasing energy efficiency by 20 per cent over the last five years and plans to do something else by 2020, it has abounded.
Pasted the Legality Expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The NAP national leader explained that the former Panist leader is in his right to consult the National Order Commission to claim what is appropriate to his right.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was attached to the legality and that the former Panist leader is in his right to go to the National Order Commission to claim what is rightfully right.
In an interview prior to Gabino Cué Monteagudo's protests as state governor, he said that in any case the expulsion of Espino is a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Sonora Order Commission."
"Mr Espino has the right, if any, to appeal to the National Council Order Commission, so that it is a decision taken in the field of a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he clarified that it is not time to think in 2012 and that it was never at the negotiating table an alliance for the presidential candidacy.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that National Action will be strengthened from the internal election of the next 4 and 5 December, in which he will have to choose his successor.
"That (an alliance in 2012) is an issue that was never at the negotiating table, at least not for now, was an approach to the local choice that was successful and met the goal," he said.
The Panist leader specified that the NAP supports 71 years of dialogue, so "we are not afraid of internal competition; the county "we enjoy and strengthen it", he said.
He said that the council will certainly be able to choose the best or the best leader required by National Action for the next three years, hence he will deliver the swindle "to whom the council determines."
"I have that absolute tranquility and openness, any of the five would be proud to hand over to the party president's office."
He predicted that the rally that registered the party in the past July 4 elections will be reflected in the following contents, although "it is not yet time to think in 2012."
"For now it's about accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he pointed out that the three governments emanating from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a point of observation throughout the country, hence that "many hopes, yearnings are placed in them, and I am sure Gabino will be up to the expectations."
When asked about the PRI's criticisms to President Felipe Calderón for his speech within the four years of his government, César Nava called on the priests to reflect on the sexes of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón; they start to defend them; they start coming out of the closet," he said.
He felt that the federal executive holder could make expressions such as those he made in his speech at the National Auditorium, because there was no biting or much less censorship in the country.
Promoting Obama on Twitter law for undocumented students
"If you agree to pass the Dream Act is appropriate, call your senators and urge them to pass it is legislation," tweeted the president of the United States in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today joined national mobilization in support of the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message in his personal account of the Twitter social network.
"If you agree to pass the Dream Act is appropriate, call your senators and urge them to pass is legislation," Obama tweeted.
His brief message kept open a cybernetic link with a broader document that called on the public to communicate immediately with the senators, as the vote in the legislation was imminent.
"With a vote that is expected to happen soon, now is the time to make your voice listen," he says.
The message was released after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote of any legislation, unless the Bush era's tax cuts were approved and government funding were approved.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote in the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned by the Republican blockade to the Dream Act and other projects, President Robert Gibbs' spokesperson entrusted that once the fiscal issue was resolved, a timetable could be set for the rest of the projects.
"I think there's a long time..."
"We all agree that we have to settle the tax matter before the end of the year..."
"I think we can get an agreement at some point on that and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
The leader of the majority Democratic Senate, Harry Reid, announced Tuesday that he would request a "closing vote" for the Dream Act, so the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on next Thursday in the Senate, although it is more likely next week.
The Senatorial version of the Dream Act or American Dream Act would legalize some 800,000 young people who entered the United States before the age of 16, have remained in the country for the last five years and entered a higher education institution or the army.
But supporters require 60 votes to approve the initiative, which requires the competition of a handful of Republicans, at a time when pro-project organizations play an intense role in ensuring the adoption of the law.
The Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, has said he will vote against, and only one Republican has expressed his support for the law, Richard Place de Indiana.
That is why the Dream Act supporters need to add to several Republicans in case other Democrats decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
Among the most courted Republicans are the Senators of Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as the outgoing Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed Senator Mel Martínez's term of office.
Other Republicans who in the past supported the Dream Act are Orrin Hatch from Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but have stated that they will not back it up again.
Another Republican who supported John McCain has not defined his position right now.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
With literature they put their finger on the lake
The second round of The pleasures of the language was a walk where the participants made a storytelling gala
"That sex in the language I understand but... the finger in the tongue? what is expected of me?" asked writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second round of The pleasures of the language, a cycle that celebrates the literature in Spanish and that this occasion used the title of his question (at another fair the round table dedicated itself to The sex in the language, he explained).
The finger on the lake... "puts us in a hurry," the Argentine writer gently pointed out to the public, mostly of young people, who met at the International Fair of the Book of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this round table moderated by Marisol Shuultz and where Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that he dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio and that Shultz would later define as a great story, with Luisa in the first person as the protagonist who seeks to know what the "llaga" is, goes from doctor to doctor, of whom he does not get answers even though he does clues in the same narrative thread.
Of the infectologist, it's convinced: "patience isn't my strength, maybe it's my league."
In the end, after a frustrated approach to the traumatologist who has stolen his breath in the middle of the corridor, but who clarifies it is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the strike is the real open, the symbolic one is the scar".
The protagonist sighed relieved and concluded "I only managed to know that it is the real open and that it does not exist", but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the tongue must go very much introverted.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both of them.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also exhibited a delightful narrative entitled Elogio of the invention, where the finger in the lake is not named but at one point it is discovered.
With brush strokes of magic realism, it tells of a famous witch, who also touched clouds, brought back men who had gone far away or repaired the virtues that a maiden would have lost, a story that came to speak later America, the great novel to which she did not miss from the beginning her own chroniclers who told her and quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticized the excesses of what was told by the conquering captains.
"Certains who invented us all (the writers) made fun of the fake witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but otherwise the history of America would never have come to be told with imagination that it lacked even the smell."
However, he highlighted "it is the crazy and the liars who best imagine" and is where it converges reality and lies, where it is no longer known that the narration belongs to one side or another, where fiction literature reaches its apogeum.
It's actually called the "cervantine tradition."
"By his inheritance we are what he counts."
In turn, writer Mayra Montero embraced and applauded the variety of interpretations to which the invitation of the FIL with her round table The finger on the neck led.
The Cuban-Puertorrhician pointed her towards the great lag of social violence going through her country - and she shares Latin America - the product of drug trafficking and drug trafficking disputes.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit commitment that is of course not premeditated," he said, after quoting that the reality of literature is the communication and the dimension of the commitment that is established between authors and readers, and that in a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The evening she was closed by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero whose intervention also emphasized "that finger on the side of the committed writer of the writer".
He considered that in a world that lives in haste, also in the intellectual customs and control of consciences that results in dogmatism, forgetting "that behind every assertion there is a small no and behind every denial there is a small yes."
"To be the owners of our thinking and to be the owners of the reality we have to tone: and mortify means many times to put the finger on the neck and to disturb those people who are much more comfortable thinking about caricature, in black and white, in established ideas and without nuance and also to disturb the powers that prefer a world in black and white," he said, inviting to recover the sense of writing.
Roman goes for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the end, he has had upswings in his career, but he has already managed to reach the decisive series three times.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the end, they also face two different styles marked by their technicians, who find each other with a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the finals, he has had ups and downs in his career, but he has already managed to reach the decisive series three times, although until now he has gone blank and that is why this occasion is very special to him.
The Argentinian has ended up consoled with the medal of the sub-champ, has left a step behind the winners and curiously with the same team has played consecutive finals.
The saintly strategy came to its first end as coach at the 2002 Opening Tournament, when he wore the reins of Morelia with which he fell overall of 4-2 before Toluca; later, in the 2003 Closure he also reached the decisive duel and also lost it with a global of 3-1 and it was precisely before Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna, at the 2010 Bicentenary Tournament, again before the Devils, Rubén again suffered a reversal, as his team ended tied 2-2 to the choricers after 210 minutes of play, but in the penalty sign he got in favour of 3-1 with two opportunities to seal the title for finally three players of his failed since 11 steps and suffered the turnover 4-3.
Rubén has already lost two finals with the Red Devils and one with Monterrey, his rival in turn, so he does not want to run the same luck, he seeks to get rid of the evil and be able to celebrate for the first time a title, although he claims that for him the most important thing is the institution.
"I want to go out champion, I don't want to break any statistics, this is for a club, for a hobby to which I owe myself, and as a result the title will come to me, but the above is the most important thing," said the helmsman when he questioned about the numbers he has against playing finals.
Very active has the previous ending, which, he says, has learned a lot, "the only teaching we can have is that until the referee sylbes the end we cannot celebrate, we are prepared in the line, the players too, because the previous time, with two criminals to throw already we were ready to go running out and I think that is a teaching, until the party is over we can celebrate."
Knowing that this series could be defined in criminal shootings, something that doesn't bother you, since it trusts its players: "One never tries to get to the penalty mark, one seeks to end in regular time, but sometimes there is no one else and we have to be prepared, in the previous tournament we were prepared, unfortunately made a bad move the fate, sometimes by nerves or the anxiety of having the title in our hands, but it's gone, that left us something for this end that we hope does not get to that instance."
Roman has in his hands no longer to be a sub-champ technician and for the first time prove the glory that the titles give.
I change rules for getting visa
Persons should go to Visa Applicants Service before their interview in the Consular Section; the cost will be lower and as well as the waiting time.
From 10 January 2011 it will change the procedure of processing a visa at the United States Embassy and consulates.
With the new procedure, the majority of applicants should go to the Visa Applicant Service (ASC) before their interview with the Consular Section.
The CSA staff shall take the applicant's biometric information, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages for applicants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, no longer necessary to make a payment to conclude the appointment, another payment to process the visa application, and another payment for the courier service to deliver the document.
The applicant will only make a single payment that will cover the three services.
The current rate will remain unchanged: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visa cases on request (including temporary workers' visas) and $390 for visas from traders and investors.
People wishing to renew their visa will not have to go to an interview with the Consular Officer, but will only go to the nearest CSA where they will present their documents and take their stamps.
Because biometric information will be taken in the AUC, applicants who require a second date to be interviewed in the Consular Section will remain in this less time than in the past.
Similarly, those applying for visas in the Consulates in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra service fee of 26 dollars.

NASA will announce extraterrestrial life finding
The U.S. space agency quoted the press to present tomorrow a finding that will impact the search for living beings in space.
The National Administration for Aeronautics and Space (NASA) of the United States will announce tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery, which could prove the theory that extraterrestrial life does exist.
The survey will be presented at a press conference tomorrow Thursday at 13:00 a.m. at NASA headquarters in Washington by experts in astrobiology, science described as responsible for studying the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
In quoting the press, NASA said it will present "a finding that will impact the extraterrestrial quest for life," which has prompted speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures alongside us and in hostile environments that were thought to be uninhabitable, and they would put on the table the possibility of becoming intelligent beings like humans if they improve the conditions in which they live.
It seems to be a microbio that was found at the bottom of the Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that was thought to be too poisonous for any form of life, as the lake is rich in arsenic.
In some way, the creature uses arsenic as a way to survive and of this capacity increases the possibility that similar life might exist on other planets, which do not have our benevolent atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be demonstrated that "if there is another way of life, a second way of life, different from what we know".
The space agency will make known the true scope of the findings at the press conference on Thursday morning.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (the largest moon of Saturn), from the perspective that his chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergence and Pattern 'block' opponent
With reforms to the Congressional Organic Law, they denounce the arrival of 'bit partyism'.
The 60 Legislature was not installed when there was an opposing bloc in Congress, led by members of the PRD, PT, Convergence and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who declared himself independent, and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of 'bipartism' in the House.
Before starting the installation session of the 60 Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergence; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of the PRD; and Patrón Montalvo, 'tronaban' against reform of the Organic Law, since it excluded them.
With this reform, they reiterated, it begins 'bipartism', because now there will be two people, of the same number of parties, who will control Congress.
These four deputies, along with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the Board of Directors, headed by Panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, as vice president.
Corvera Quevedo explained that these institutional reforms constitute the political marginality of the PRI and the PAN.
He explained that in the next few days they will talk to the representatives of the PAN and PRI to modify the scheme, starting from a political will, and if they do not have it, then they will be devastated again by both parties and with that end the opposing coalition ended.
"So far here (the opposing coalition) is what I look at, because we are excluded, from any decision, they don't even have the political difference to consider the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergence, mentioned that with the PRD, PT and Patron, there are coincidences and therefore they are forming a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, it went on, that Congress after it had been monopolistic, now be "duopolic."
"It is not the spirit of reforming the law that there is eternal bipatidism in Congress."
To begin with, this group is starting with 5 legislators, and they are talking to other colleagues to make them more, the convergent abounds.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, from PT, explained that today the Congress became a 'botin' between two, alluding to the PAN and PRI.
"Before it was just a game, now they're sharing it between two."
Patron Montalvo, asked to respect the personality of the Member, was given his place at the negotiating tables.
"Let's not by cupular agreements, let's leave out to 5 that we're probably going to make 9 deputies, save the five that see us, separated into different fractions, we've decided to unify ourselves to look for a place at the negotiating table, that's the subject that in the reform they made that they agreed, we're out and we're not in agreement with that reform."
Sale $200,000 more for "the supplier"
Pay City Hall of Mazatlan another check to the company's alleged owner of electrical material.
A check for just over 200,000 pesos for Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Hall.
With this, the amount that has been paid in this second semester to the owner of the electrical material company, amounts to 1 million 200 thousand pesos.
According to the Municipality's transparency page, this last check number 9258447 was issued on 16 November, by the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, under the concept of "liquidation of accounts payable".
The Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had advanced that he would pay more money from the Commune in favour of this supplier, which was observed by the State Superior Audit for selling at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total still owed to you and thus how many more cheques are left for dispatch in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing has been bought, he is simply being paid what he owes, like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "repaired" in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two on 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and the latter on 16 November.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal of the State, as the Act shows when a company is questioned by the ESA, in order to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasurer assured that they have not reused their services.
The above, after that on 25 July, Northwest published a revision to the cheques that issued the City Hall to its suppliers, in which it was revealed that, from March 2008 to 9 July 2010, in the triennium of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, Camacho Palazuelos paid over 10 million pesos, through 42 cheques.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, where he collected checks for more than 3 million pesos.
Urgency to meet tourist sites
They lament tourist entrepreneurs accident of the foreign tourist by poor conditions of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlan.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a sinking of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourism sector in Mazatlan asked the authorities to pay attention to areas and sites that are in poor condition and to project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Merchants of the Golden Zone, recalled that on several occasions they have denounced that the image of fate is taken care of and reverse the evil that tourists find with new activities or routes.
He said that the bad state of the streets and banquets has affected because the tourists come to walk and see the mess and take him back to the nearby businesses.
"Politics don't know what it's like to close a company one day and they don't have any idea of the money that's lost, or otherwise they didn't do the works this way in a long time and without proper planning."
Hoteler José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of the tourist exposed the City Hall's lack of prevention and maintenance.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and prevent it from happening again, as it provides preventive maintenance and does not fall into the corrective only," he said.
"We are eager to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area must be maintained, but as inhabitants we deserve a clean place to live and the City Council must change its strategy to keep the city well."
There are other sites that also look careless and incomplete, he said, like the Shield and the Poison of Mazatlan.
"Today, in order for the tourist to come not only depends on the promotion, there has to be a good product, a city that has cleaning on its beaches, on its avenues, permanent maintenance in what are the tourist attractions," he said.
"It has not been given due attention and this type of fact reveals something that is notorious for all, maintenance is needed."
Raúl Llera Martínez, Assistant Secretary for Tourism Promotion, said that rescue of tourist sites in Mazatlan is urgent, as they are not properly exploited and project a bad image.
He spoke of a number of places that should be put in line with the municipality and be priority to have the city up-to-date, clean, tidy and attractive because it is of touristic vocation.
" Fortunately Mazatlan offers many historical and cultural sites and sites that will have to order first, clean and put us online to make them attractive so that we can add them to the inventory we have to promote the destination."
Request IP results to Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CEC, proposed that Members assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing a better Sinaloa for the various challenges it faces.
A law of decent and free labour between parties and the state executive demands the business sector of Mazatlan, because there is a convulsed Sinaloa that faces great problems.
Since yesterday, the 60 legislature, composed of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 of the NAP, three of the New Alliance Party, two of the PRD, one of the PT, one of the Convergence and one of the PVEM, totaling a total of 40 popular representatives.
The list of expectations of the new members of the State Congress is that they will come to conduct a clean and commitment management with society and with the different sectors that require responsible legislative work and that the same patterns of partisanism or paternalism are not repeated.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, president of the Business Coordinator Council, proposed that the newly premiered 40 members of the State Congress assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing a better Sinaloa for the various challenges it faces.
"We hope that Members will actually exercise their right, free from agreements between parties because it is customary for them to make arrangements to ensure their own interests and become carnival appearances of the rulers and leaders of the parliamentary fractions."
Hence, he spoke of certifying the commitment to establish the necessary bridges to move ahead to the Ruler in turn.
"We assume that they will come to do a decent job and, above all, committed to society and to the sectors because it was the Signalians who gave them the vote of confidence in the past elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Association of Hotels Three Islands, considered that one of the major challenges of the 40 popular representatives is to push and add forces in search of the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is very complicated.
"The most important thing is that they push economic growth, which generates incentives for investment and infrastructure, and that will somehow encourage job generation."
With regard to tourism, he asked that the new legislators give him the weight within the state budget to strengthen the State Tourism Secretariat.
"I have understood that it is the second Secretariat in the state with a lower budget and is inconsistent as an important economic activity that generates currency and investment and that directly competes with the agro-industry."
In addition to the need to label resources to detonating tourism projects and to assist them in providing security to the state and in updating the Alcohol Act that they have not been able to resolve in previous legislatures.
A Magic King Searched for
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the yearning of the children of the family Coronado Valenzuela.
For his parents, the next King's Day will be difficult to please his illusions, as his home is made up of nothing more and nothing less than 12 people and a nail.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchor, Gaspar and Baltazar will give them the toys and clothing they so desire.
The family lives a humble house of the Colonia Salvador Allende and lives a day because the father does not have a fixed job.
"For sometimes we look hard because my husband has no chamba, but we sell mandarina and papa... I'm going out with the 'plebs' to sell to the street," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Adelaide, 4 years old, wants a doll or a bicycle, while her sister Isabel, 3 years old, likes a Barbie doll.
For his part, 10-year-old José Alfredo aspires for a long time to have a 'monster' car and for his 8-month-old brother Jesus, Cayetana suggests clothing size for a year.
"He told me (José Alfredo), 'I would like this monster', but I told him 'we're going to see son', because he was very expensive," said Cayetana sadly.
For older children, who were in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
11 - year - old María Guadalupe is size 12; Isaiah, 10 - year - old, is size 10, while Michael, 8 - year - old, uses size eight.
José Juan, aged 14, lacks tennis, so a pair of sizes five and a half or six would be of great help.
If you want to help make reality the dream of the children of the family Coronado Valenzuela can participate in the campaign Searching for a Magi King, giving a toy or cash at the reception of Northwest.
Fourteen alleged drug traffickers arrested
On Wednesday, in Estrie, a dozen persecutions have been carried out in the context of the dismantling of a production and sale network of Cannabis.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The persecutions have occurred in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mainly in the places where drug production was being carried out.
"About 750 plants have been seized from Cannabis, four kilos of hashish, money and production equipment," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman of the Quebec Security.
In total, eleven men and three women have been arrested, including the two alleged network leaders, two Sherbrooke men.
The detainees had to appear at the Sherbrooke courthouse in the hours following their arrest.
They could face accusations of cannabis production, possession for the purpose of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These persecutions have taken place after a long investigation that has lasted almost a year.
"It has been the information provided by the public that has allowed us to carry out the arrests," says Mr Ruel.
This police operation involved around 70 officers of the Quebec Security Strait Investigation Module, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Department.
It will be possible to combat illegal migration without problems
The draft law of the Conservatives, which the Government believes should address the problem of illegal migrants ' loaded ducks, will surely face a great opposition, as the three opposition parties have announced on Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I am principally based on the Charter."
"I meet here with a party that has created the granite that weighs," liberal leader Michael Ignatieff declared, surrounded by the deputies after the weekly meeting of the caucus.
Liberals advocate that the bill in its current form, which would allow anyone from a vessel identified as transporting illegal immigrants to stop up to one year, violating the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The leader of the Quebec Block, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the bill because it points to the wrong target.
"We are against and, it seems, all the opposition parties are against the project, so we will see what the government is doing," said Mr. Duceppe.
NPD's criticism of immigration, Olivia Chow, has rejected from a penitentiary criticism that her party is not strong enough with illegal immigrants.
"The Neo-Democrats agree that measures are taken against illegal patrol officers and that is what we intend with another bill, the C-35," says Mrs Chow.
"We do not support the Conservative Bill because it attacks refugees and imprisons children for a minimum of one year," explained Mrs Chow.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney has accused parties of playing politicians and ignoring the Canadian will.
"The vast majority of Canadians tell Members not to tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations against Canada and to treat the country as a falsifier."
"They hope that Canada will take firm action," said Minister Kenney.
The Government has not announced a vote of confidence on its bill, which could lead the country to elections as a result of its rejection.
However, a Conservative has informed the QMI Agency that the Government was going to request a vote so that each member who is going to oppose will later be explained to its constituents.
The new unit does not achieve unanimity
Although the possible establishment of a permanent unit to combat corruption and collision by Jean Charest had been announced, many observers continued to call for the establishment of a public consultation commission on the issue.
The Minister of Public Security, Robert Dut, supports that this idea has not been raised two days ago: Quebec would have consulted the Department of Investigation in New York since January last year.
Metropolis has had a permanent anti-corruption unit since 1870.
The Tuesday announcement has therefore caught more than one by surprise.
It should be said that, during a meeting of the Permanent Council on Police Services in Quebec on 29 October, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
That was enough for the Quebec party critic who deals with the issue of public security, Stéphane Bergeron, to qualify this ad as "a rabbit taken from the sparkle" and as "a last-minute chapucera solution".
Minister Dutil, for his part, has responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence on possible future unity.
"You'll see the results when we announce it," he simply says.
"We are aware of this problem."
For the president of the CSQ, Rejean Parent, there is nothing that can replace the launch of a public survey.
"The more Mr Charest refused to set up this commission of inquiry, the more people share our opinion, that is, that he has something to hide," he explains.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry is with the resignation of Jean Charest," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance of the National School of Public Administration.
In order to get out of this deadlock, he suggested that Quebec issue a special mandate to the general interventioner to conduct a survey on collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to expand the mandate of the general intervener," he concludes.
He also believed that Quebec could give the same powers as a commissioner, thus forcing people to testify.
The creation of a permanent grid is not the only project in the Charest Government.
Quebec also requests Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to better adapt to this type of crime.
This request appears to be from the Prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who has informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law is not explicit in this type of investigation.
The Federal Minister of Public Security, Vic Toews, has confirmed for his part that his Justice counterpart, Rob Nicholson, is currently inclined to make certain amendments to this issue.
During Operation Spring 2001 related to engine groups, although the Criminal Code had not been adapted, 131 persons were arrested.
Subsequently, Ottawa promoted the adoption of the gangsterism law.
Rivers under extreme surveillance
Several water courses are being monitored closely because of the heavy rainfall that has occurred in several regions of the province since Tuesday.
On Wednesday afternoon, a landslide occurred in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
As a preventive measure, two houses have been evacuated.
At night, another land run occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
A road went down.
From Tuesday to Wednesday night, different regions experienced heavy rainfall, between 40 and 70 millimetres of rain.
In addition, additional 20 to 40 millimetres are expected from now until Thursday night, depending on the region.
Sectors located north of the river and in the valley of the Outaouais were the most affected.
They could get up to a total of 100 millimetres of rain.
Since these rainfalls add to the snow thawing already accumulated in certain sectors, several rivers are feared to overflow.
On Wednesday night, the Quebec Civil Security Unit issued warnings for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
The northern rivers, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentides, and in the Chene, in Lotbinière, have already caused floods in the past and are under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, the heavy rainfall has caused some lakes to overflow in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, the heavy rains have dragged a temporary bridge.
As a preventive measure, ten residences have been evacuated.
In Outaouais, the overflow of certain lakes has led to the closure of several routes, particularly in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The Civil Security Unit remains vigilant and closely monitored, as indicated by Annik Bouchard, a security adviser.
The Quebec Growth Forecast Centre, for its part, issued Wednesday announcements communicating the strong growth of several rivers, in particular Maskinongé, Assumption, Oueau, Achigan, Batscan and Loup.
Partial Culpan in Dupont
The radio host of Quebec Stéphane Dupont has faced a certain set of setbacks to the Canadian Radio Television Standards Council (CCNR) for controversial statements regarding social assistance and Haitians, as well as for their rough language on radio.
The CCNR considers that Mr Dupont and his team of CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their opinion, but certain statements contained "inaccurate information on social assistance, an unduly negative representation of Haitians and rough language that should not be used in broadcasts during the day."
The Council has also indicated that the discussions on suicide, including the disclosure of the name of two people who had committed suicide, do not violate the codes on broadcasting.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding comments made in emissions from 2008 to 2010.
The first decision was issued following a complaint from the common front of persons receiving social assistance from Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts mentioned in the issue were not correct.
Presenters should communicate reliable and not misleading data.
Regarding suicide, the present Stéphane Dupont had demonstrated that suicide was an act of cowardice.
Most members of the Committee have concluded that the message transmitted was that suicide should not be regarded as a solution to life's problems.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes put in question by "Dupont le midi" have dealt with a sensitive subject in a fair and appropriate manner."
Accordingly, any guilt has been discarded in this regard.
The last dispute referred to the statements made after the earthquake in Haiti.
At that time, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had played a media confrontation that had aroused numerous reactions.
The CHOI presenter stated that he had not made any donations to help Haitians because he could not know for sure whether the needy were really going to receive the money.
The Committee considers that these comments are not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an unduly negative representation of Haitians.
"I've already served my three-day suspension up there."
"My file has been clean for a year and a half," said the presenter.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the issue of rough language.
In any case, the CHOI-FM radio chain has collaborated "even more than required".
The consequences shall be minimum for the station, which shall, inter alia, announce the decisions once at the time of the highest hearing within three days.
A king of kung-fu in Montreal
The Algerian-born Montrealans Nacereddine Zemmal have had an extremely peculiar tour.
The athlete, who stands out in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and thai box, climbs to the world's tatamis and ringes in search of new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts like kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria," explained Zemmal, who has lived in the metropolis since 2008 to advance at the professional level.
"In my case, I'm looking for fights everywhere because, for those who don't enjoy the game on the ground that involve mixed martial arts, there are few competitions in North America."
The athlete, who works as a security officer and as an employee of the UPS company, has recently given bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Amateur Championship of the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), held from 23 to 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I have won in the categories of kickboxing full contact and thai box," he explained.
"I am currently preparing to participate in the World Cup of San Shu in China."
"They will invite sportsmen who have finished among the first four positions in the world's last championship in each category."
"In 2009, I won the bronze medal in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished in eighth place."
"In 2007, in China, I finished the tournament in fifth place, but reached the third in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"The interesting thing is that I've been making progress in every competition."
"To this step, I'll be the first time this time or next year!"
The "san hou" or "sanda" is a discipline originating in China where it is allowed to hit with the fists and feet, as well as to throw the opponents to the ground.
The confrontations were originally held on a platform and, less often, in a ring.
The most famous boxist in this type of combat is the Vietnamese American Cung Le, widely recognized in the world of martial arts.
Although Nacer Zemmal should only hold a competition in his career, he will no doubt come to the great "King of Sanda" tournament, the Super Bowl of kung-fu.
"This competition is China's most famous and prestigious," explains the friendly boy.
"It's like the equivalent of Lumpinee Stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand).
"It's been an incredible experience."
Zemmal won his first fight, in the semifinals of his category (80 kg), but lost at the end.
"The one who won me is a real professional," he says.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semifinals are faced at the end of their category."
"Then the champions of each category face to crown a single champion, the king of kung-fu."
450 million in contracts without invitation to tender
Hydro-Québec has awarded direct contracts worth $450 million to engineering companies for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the centre of this avalanche of more than one hundred contracts there is a consortium formed by BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has obtained without a prior invitation to tender the most important contract, the project management company, for a sum of 295 million.
The consortium, called Energie gerance, was created in 2004 following Hydro-Québec's decision to entrust the private sector with its responsibility to manage this major hydroelectric project of $5 billion.
In early 2005, the Energy Management Consortium obtained the lucrative contract without a public invitation to tender.
For the Party of Quebec, the use of company consortia poses a serious ethical problem which threatens to eliminate competition and provoke a rise in prices.
"This is a new method of collusion and elimination of competition."
"I mean, people, instead of doing it in secret, now they do it openly," declared yesterday the member of the Quebec Party Sylvain Simard in a press conference.
Earlier in the morning, Mr Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because, he says, he does not understand how it can benefit the public interest in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, responded in the afternoon, firmly denying a collision with this contract.
"I'm starting to get tired," he protested, arguing that the PQ had acted "dishonestly" and "without rigor."
He pointed out that "the minimum" would be for the PQ to apologize.
The formula of the consortia is a common practice throughout the world.
Normally, it is an alliance with a time limit that allows two or several companies to pool their knowledge to respond to a bidding for a complex project.
The Eastmain project presents a high level of complexity, taking into account the magnitude of the works.
The works have already started and will last until 2012.
In any event, the contract has been awarded without competition being involved; it has been negotiated.
In addition, the consortium formula has ceased to be the exception to the Quebec standard, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir published last week, the consortium formula in the technical advice sector is being investigated in the Government.
A quick look at Quebec's commercial register enables the identification of more than 200 consortia, some of which seem permanent.
Thus, Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, such as CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin, Roche et Tecsult, and others.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to a single legal person, that is, Dessau.
With regard to the Energy Management Consortium, Minister Normandeau has pointed out that "the James Bay territory responds to a particular labour dynamics and Hydro-Québec has been responding specifically to it since the 1970s."
The great head of the Eastmain project, Real Laporte, of the James Bay Energy Corporation (SEBJ), has given an explanation that has highlighted the fact that the project management contract has been granted directly.
"If you respond to a bidding and there are few participants, your prices will be higher."
"You have two options: you can contact the actors in the sector and tell them: we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement with a good price."
"But the idea is that what matters is not the price, but the competition of people," said Mr Laporte.
The contract awarded to the Energy Management Consortium is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
Following the verification, Le Devoir identified 109 technical advisory contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to companies or their subsidiaries, in particular geotechnical laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has obtained 22 contracts, Genivar won 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without taking into account its participation in Energy gerance.
All contracts were negotiated.
The total amount is $449,783.344, including the energy management contract of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard has suggested that the four companies that form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "good known to the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau has dropped that the QP is also linked to these companies, who "finance" it, before specifying that it is more of their leaders.
Responsible consumption barometer. The "green" label does not inspire confidence
More ecological, but deeply sceptical.
The consumer trusts only in the actors of sustainable development, as well as in fair trade marks and ecological certificates to guide their elections.
According to the responsible consumption barometer, the first results of which were published yesterday, the situation is even worse. The consumer is immersed in a media universe by which messages defend more responsible consumption are stacked, but regrets the lack of reliable information and considers that it even slows its commitment.
Even if the consumption of products called "socially responsible" has increased in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those trying to sell them.
Two thirds of them say, in fact, that they do not trust the environmental commitment of companies or the environmental advertising of them, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Centre for Responsible Consumption of Sherbrooke University.
Another conclusion: half of consumers question the reliability of the official certificates that bear the so-called fair products, as well as the credibility of the products and brands that bear labels indicating that they are "ecorresponsible", says the Barometer.
Similarly, only 14.6% of Quebecers take political speeches seriously on this issue.
In any event, information on responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this consumption sector, currently supported by about one third of Quebec consumers.
In fact, gaps and the questionable nature of the information make 46% of consumers want this option.
This is the second obstacle identified by the Barometer, following the highest price of these products.
In addition, one third of Quebecers claim to be suspicious of the alleged yields of ecological products or services they are trying to sell.
On the other hand, almost half of consumers changed their habits in 2010 and, in particular, changed the brand of one or more products to respect their convictions.
A 61% has given priority to shopping in the shops of his neighborhood and has preferred to buy grown food in his region, says the Barometer.
Greener and more responsible (the responsible consumption index has reached 64 points over a maximum of one hundred this year), the Homo consumus of Quebec loves to occupy the position of the King of Recycling who tries to reduce its impact on the environment by worrying about the protection of the fauna.
However, according to the Barometer, this social awareness seems to be from doors (from your car) outside: in 2010, only 28% of Quebecers indicated that they have used public transport or shared cars to defend their ecological principles.
In addition, 39.1% of the participants in this extensive behavioural survey, which has just completed its first edition, supports the use of the bicycle and on foot travel.
A loan for the state to recover eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, to which they have asked for financial commitment to the recovery of the eXcentris cinema complex places the Angus Society and the Parallel, agrees to cooperate, but only through a loan.
The Angus Development Society and the Parallel, which expected a $7 million donation from the Ministry of Culture to buy Daniel Langlois again the eXcentris cinema complex in the Saint-Laurent Boulevard and return his true Cinéfil vocation, have not obtained what they requested.
The Government has agreed to become involved in the matter, but under its own conditions.
Instead of the expected donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan which would, in fact, be lower than the initial expectations; it could constitute a viable solution in advantageous conditions, at least in the opinion of certain public employees.
Quebec had already rejected last spring a first action plan and a request of 12.8 million, but since then applications have been revised downwards.
The president of the Société de développement des Empreses Culturales (SODEC), François Macerola, who leads the eXcentris file, referred a proposal and action plan to the Minister St-Pierre.
He sent her a final report a decade ago.
However, SODEC received a counter-proposal from the Cabinet on Tuesday.
The Parallel and Angus have a deadline until 31 December to respond to it.
In any event, it seems that the hypothesis of a State donation must be completely discarded.
We recall that the Association of owners of cinema rooms and cinema complexes in Quebec opposed a direct investment by the State to support the recovery of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture should not finance real estate projects, since it has not done so with other cinema halls.
On the other hand, a number of representatives of the sector are calling for considerable economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, the owner of the same, has carried for ten years the burden of authoring cinema in his premises of the complex, after financing his own construction, which could justify a derogation from the Treasury Council.
The lack of independent film rooms is evident in Montreal and eXcentris had been able to loyalty its clientele.
Angus and Parallèle, led by Christian Yaccarini, promote a private funding campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to open the way to acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one of these rooms, the Parallel, continues to project films in eXcentris.
The goal of future buyers is to reopen the three rooms on February 27, projecting the beautiful film of Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des dieux".
However, Christian Yaccarini has not contacted Le Devoir again and we do not know what he and his group think of the proposals they have received.
He lifts the veil of Canada filled with...
The new U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks reveal what the United States considers to be the Canadian complex with respect to the Americans, but both reflect the feeling of superiority of the latter to Canada.
American diplomats are surprised that Canadian voters do not think about Canada-United States relations when they are going to vote and believe that President Obama's visit has helped the conservative government to get its budget approved in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy of Ottawa and Washington that have been made public yesterday provide rather juicy details that really substantial content.
A cable dated 22 September 2008, that is, during full federal electoral campaign, relates to how far the United States does not get into the issues discussed by political leaders.
This caused great surprise to the American ambassador sent to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins offers some explanations of this situation.
"Perhaps political leaders are conditioned by a complex of virtually inferiority inherent to Canadians in dealing with daily domestic issues, rather than leaving that choice to the United States (as during the 1988 Free Trade Campaign)" writes.
Therefore, he concludes, the United States is "the proverbial elephant of this choice: omnipresent, but potentially too dangerous to talk about."
The ambassador has even more problems understanding this "single silence" because the two countries have intense political and economic relations.
"Logically, he feels, the capacity of a candidate, of a party and, even more, the head of a party to manage these essential relationships should be a key factor in which voters should think about in voting."
This important feeling can also be observed the cable sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, who is in charge of business in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help ensure the survival of the government during the vote of confidence in early February on the federal budget, through which Canada will record for the first time deficit in the last decade due to a recovery plan of between $30,000 and $40 billion," writes Mr.Breese.
No mention is made of the fact that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas to prevent it from being replaced by the coalition or that opposition parties conditional on its survival to the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another January 2008 communication signed by Ambassador Wilkins alerts Washington on the increasingly negative image that transmits the drama series broadcast at the U.S. CBC.
The ambassador is concerned about the issue of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which subtle references are made to Maher Arar, to the "No-Fly-List" or even to kidnappings for the CIA to carry out rigorous interrogations.
Another cable tells us that during his first bilateral meeting Hillary Clinton asked his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe would be willing to welcome some Guantánamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner replied that he did, but he did depend on "every case."
At the end of the meeting, they wrote, "she delivered a document to the Secretary of State regarding Omar Khadr, a Muslim of 15 years of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary agreed to review the file."
Finally, we can mention that the moods for WikiLeaks have been warmed.
Tom Flanagan, a former counselor very close to Stephen Harper, stated on the CBC radio that the person responsible for this massive escape should be "killed".
In the United States, Mike Huckabee echoes.
A Global Plan for Renewal of Lighting
Yesterday, the UN has proposed in Cancún a renewal plan for domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in one hundred countries to reduce greenhouse gases (GEI) in an amount that is almost one third of the additional decrease to be made to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is part of the set of major specific projects that the UN expects to take in Cancún to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments in industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs, which still monopolize between 50 and 70% of the market, were replaced by fluocompact bulbs or, even better, by light bulbs of electroluminescent diodes (DEL or "LED" in English), much of the 1.800 million tonnes (Gt) of GHG issued on the planet would be avoided to illuminate humans.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
It is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions from the planetary motor park.
In Copenhagen, last year, large issuing countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, were committed to voluntary reduction plans that were expected to decrease global GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, 5 Gt of that quantity should be reduced to stabilise, by 2020, the two-degree temperature increase in order to prevent it from being decommissioned.
In the incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy is dissipated in the form of heat and the rest, i.e. 5%, produces light.
In the case of fluocompact bulbs, energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, energy consumption is further reduced twice as much.
Fluocompact bulbs last an average of 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED light bulbs, like those that the manufacturer Philips has launched this week (a company that has also participated in the UN study), have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, allowing us to get an idea of the savings that can be achieved with the replacement plan that would be applied in one hundred countries.
These new bulbs can also work with reostates and emit very little heat.
Above that, they contain nothing of mercury.
Several experts have expressed reservations about fluocompact bulbs, since they contain mercury and must be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers place instructions.
However, the report indicates, the main source of mercury emission on the planet is not the fluocompact bulbs, but the thermal coal plants, which emit a large amount of mercury to produce the electricity that is spilled with the incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these power stations emit 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report details the advantages that this international programme would offer each country.
For example, Indonesia would thus save one billion dollars a year in electricity and eight million tons of CO2, i.e., the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power stations whose construction would cost it 2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast eagerly awaits the announcement of electoral results
The UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, has requested the "immediate" publication of the results of the presidential elections in Côte d'Ivoire, as the deadlines have expired.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and announce the interim results immediately," said a spokesman for the UN Chief.
"Ask all Côte d'Ivoire parties and institutions to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite the pressure exerted by some foreign governments, the electoral commission has allowed the deadline of Wednesday to midnight without the results being published, three days after Sunday polling.
About forty minutes before the end of the deadline, the President of the CIS had told the television that the commission "keep working" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, the requests for the CIS finally to proclaim the name of the winner of the second round between outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara have been multiplied in the world.
However, the Gbagbo side has had the constitutional council annulling "fraudulent" votes in the north, in the hands of the former rebellion of the New Forces (FN) since the failed coup d'état in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the campaign of the President of Côte d'Ivoire, has stated that the voter intimidation maneuvers carried out by the FNs in the north of the country had deterred the followers of the outgoing president from voting.
The whole election could be cancelled if the Constitutional Council accepted the complaints submitted by Gbagbo.
However, Gbagbo's opponents consider that the highest court in the country is not neutral, since it is led by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a northern man who denies any relationship with the former rebels, has judged the delay in publishing the results "unacceptable" and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, but has not gone as far as to claim victory.
Its allies claim that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows that he has lost and has filed a complaint with the Constitutional Council after preventing the electoral commission from spreading the results, it would be illegal.
The second round of the Presidents on Sunday should have tipped off the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country divided into two years.
The United Nations had warned the Ivory Coast political class on Wednesday that they could be held responsible for possible acts of violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished on the first round, on 31 October, with 38 per cent of the votes against 32 per cent of Alassane Ouattara, who received public support from former President Henri Konan Bédié (25 per cent on the first round).
The unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter
According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), the unemployment rate in France has remained stable in 9.3 per cent in continental territory (9.7 per cent taking into account overseas departments), as indicated by the data corrected by the provisional seasonal variations (CVE) published on Thursday by Insee.
The number of stops remains at 2,631,000 in mainland France.
Data from the second quarter have been confirmed, 9.3 per cent of the active population in continental territory and 9.7 per cent with the DOMs.
In one year, the unemployment rate has increased by 0.1 points.
In general, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter, but they want to work, whether they are available in the two weeks to work and seek or not.
The situation of young people in the labour market has continued to worsen, with a further increase in the unemployment rate up to 24.2% in continental France (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year), 25% including the DOMs.
During the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged 15-24 were unemployed within the ILO.
For its part, there has been a slight increase in unemployment among older people, up to 6.4% in continental France (+0.2 points both in three months and in one year), i.e. 482,000 people over 50 years of age, which is 6.6% with the DOMs.
There has only been a stability of unemployment among the aged between 25 and 49, with 8.3% in continental France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% in all France.
Insee has not published the monthly unemployment rate since 2006, following a controversy over its methods of calculation.
Eurostat, the European Union statistics agency, continued to do so and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (including DOM) in October, after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guerini investigated and detained
Alexandre Guérini, 53, director of waste treatment companies and brother of the PS President of the General Council of Bouches-du-Rhône, is being investigated and has been imprisoned in the Luynes prison, near Aix-en-Provence, as part of an investigation into alleged fraudulent public contracts.
Alexandre Guerini is being investigated for abuse of social property, misappropriation of funds and public property, covering, active corruption, trafficking in influence and possession of ammunition, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guerini will fight and answer all the questions posed to him by the magistrate, not ghosts."
"It is easy to pursue him by a multitude of reprehensible acts, another thing is to prove them," AFP had told AFP his lawyer, Florence Rault, before his client showed up.
Mr. Guerini, brother of the PS leader in the department, Jean-Noël Guerini, has wanted to send through his lawyers to the judge, before his appearance, a document to explain himself.
On Wednesday night they began investigating and incarcerated one of their people nearby, Philippe Rapezzi.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, the only thing your client has done has been dealing with the landfills that must be managed.
As regards the allocation of contracts or the destination of the funds related to their implementation, he knows nothing about this, according to counsel Simon.
As part of this file, he has also been investigated since Wednesday, Daniel Pinna, former director general of the urban agglomeration services of Aubagne, for misusing funds and complicity, but has left him on parole and has forbidden to meet with the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to explain all the facts that have been reproached."
"The investigating magistrate has taken into account the explanations and released him," Mr. Yann Arnoux explained.
On Tuesday night on Wednesday four other persons were interrogated and released, under judicial control in the case of two of them, according to Deputy Prosecutor of the Republic, Michel Rafin.
Michel Karabadhakian, Deputy Director General of Marseille Provence Metropole (MPM), has been accused of "trafficking influences and passive corruption".
Two officials from the Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Brindisier agglomeration have been questioned by "abstracting and misusing public property by a person dedicated to public service" and "complicity in misusing public funds", respectively.
Finally, the companion of Alexandre Guerini, Jeannie Peretti, is being investigated by "covering the abuse of social property".
Among the people who have faced Mr. Guerini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned in a parallel case of fraudulent public contracts affecting Corsica.
Researchers suspect that their societies have served to launder the capital of the great banditry.
The investigation is being conducted in the context of several judicial instructions initiated against X in April 2009 following the receipt of anonymous communications, of course fraud in the allocation of public contracts, particularly in the waste sector.
A source close to the research indicates that research is particularly concentrated on the conditions of allocation and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which collects the wastes of Aubagne, as well as other cities in the urban community of Marseilles (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss case: Elisha exaggerated Syria's mediation
For more than ten months, between July 2009 and May 2010, Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher detained in Iran for "spying", has had the public in disgrace in France, has alerted diplomacy and has accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the close look of the diplomats in the United States.
The US documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some unknown aspects of this crisis.
They describe how Elisha has explained his strategy to Americans to the point of giving them advice to manage their own "rehens" crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of the young French did not occur in exchange for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian arrested in France and sought for U.S. justice for trafficking in materials for the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they reveal the harsh reality of how the French presidency tried to manipulate the media to give the idea that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad had played an essential role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
Actually, he didn't do anything.
A diplomatic telegram written on 12 August 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to handle hostage-taking cases".
Elise's counselor for strategic issues, François Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, talks with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method.
They advise Americans to do the following to repatriate their own citizens held by force in Iran.
"Make noise," they say, "let go continuously" in the media the words "fundamental human rights", "innocence", "instant liberation".
Everything to shame the Iranian regime, careful of its image.
"When the Iranians ask you to stop, do it more often."
Because, once attempts to negotiate through discrete channels have been exhausted, "silence will solve nothing," Iranians are "experts in dilatory maneuvers."
Mr. Richier adds that the detention of foreigners is "a usual Iranian tactic: taking hostages for political blackmail."
It announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss prison (which will take place on 16 August, the day it will take refuge at the Embassy of France) "will require the Iranians to pay a large amount of money" (230,000 euros of reward).
He also notes that Elisha anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that "is going to increase".
Iranians could "in the near future stop another of the nearly 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he says.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss is released from prison after 12 days, but it's blocked in Iran.
The following information is disseminated: Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition requests the United States for illicit trafficking in sensitive electronic material to Iran, has been released in Paris by a judge's decision.
The U.S. Embassy, like many observers, doubt this strange coincidence.
For Washington, close to Iranian clandestine nuclear material acquisition networks, Majid Khakavand's excarceration is bad news.
Did France accept an exchange?
Free the Iranian in exchange for the French?
During a new conversation with Kathleen Allegrone, on September 4, François Richier assures that it did not.
Elisha said, not only "has he been greatly surprised by the judge's decision" but has tried to oppose it.
"There have been intense negotiations between the French Presidency and the Minister of Justice" (at the time Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government cannot nullify the decision" the court comments.
Mr Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand is still under the "close" surveillance of French information services.
The counselor of Elisha marks a telephone number, hangs and then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian "is currently in Paris buildings managed by the Iranian embassy."
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, Elisha does not spare in efforts, uses communications and "fires" organized in the media to make it believe that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays a "important" and "influent" role of "mediator".
The Americans observe this activity with some irony and verify that the manipulation bears fruit, as several press articles transmit the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 mentions "the media blitz of French officials".
For what such "gratitude" is due to Mr Assad, the embassy in Paris is asked.
"Despite their words of praise, French officials recognize in private that they only have a vague idea of what Syrians have actually done."
The document then discusses the reasons that led Elisha to support this fiction.
The great communication effort "is aimed at validating Sarkozy's policy of opening to Syria", he says.
A policy launched in 2008 that "in the opinion of many critical voices in France and abroad, had just been tarnished with prematureness and demerited."
By "exaggerating the Syrian role", Paris tries "to show Syria the praise that can be reaped if it plays a constructive role in the region".
The goal is also to "seed the seed of discord between Syria and Iran."
The U.S. Embassy knows it well.
On August 11, François Richier confides to him: "Of course, we don't know if the Syrians have done anything or not."
"But anyway, we thanked him."
"At least, this should cause confusion among the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy received it in Elisha.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Sirio who had played an "active role in the liberation of our countryman".
From midnight on, young Koreans can't play online
The South Korean Government is going to adopt a law called "Cenicienta" that will prevent adolescents from participating in online games after midnight blocking their access, as government officials have indicated.
A bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to request online gaming companies to block access to these games after midnight to young people under 16 years of age, according to representatives of the Ministries of Culture and Family.
"Many children play all night and then find it difficult to study at school and lead a normal life during the day."
"We think this law is necessary to protect your health and your right to sleep," said AFP Jo Rin, a ministerial officer in charge of the bill.
Online games will be available again at 6 a.m.
Companies will have one year to prepare for the implementation of the law, as specified.
The government is also asking companies to limit the time of daily access to these games when the parents of young people ask for it, he added.
In addition, it will make it available to anyone requesting free software to allow limited Internet connection time.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report on various facts related to intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the indisputable champion of global online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, where 58 other countries faced.
2018-2022 World: FIFA designates the organizing countries
In the midst of the storm caused by suspected corruption, FIFA's executive committee designates Thursday to the 2018 and 2022 World Cup organizing countries, a clearly political choice where influence struggles and lobbying can come to prominence over technical criteria.
One thing is clear, the 2018 edition of the FIFA competition will be held in Europe, a traditional bastion of discipline (four candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal and the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will be much more exotic, as the International Federation hopes to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a premiere on the African continent in 2010, or to continue its implementation in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of the figures that were part of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the heads of Belgian and Dutch Government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) testifies to the economic and political interests at stake in a World.
Transactions between the backrests, therefore, may last until the last minute.
It is also difficult to establish a hierarchy among the candidates.
According to FIFA's assessment report, English, Hispanic-Portuguese (2018) and US (2022) candidatures have better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not be too weighty for the 22 members of the executive committee in voting.
The Sunday Times, responsible for the revelations that led to the suspension by corruption of two EC members (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have ruined the opportunities of his country, the cradle of football, which only welcomed the World once, in 1966.
The BBC added firewood on Monday by broadcasting a documentary that has evidenced three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Enough to disgust FIFA and shame the British officials, who have been thrown into an intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron in the head.
The Chief of Government hopes to re-edit the successful coup by his predecessor, Tony Blair, who had achieved in 2005 for London the organization of the JJ.O.O. 2012.
Will this intense activity be enough to regain England's shine before the EC?
It is not clear, since the Spanish-Portugal duo also has numerous strengths thanks to its stadiums, already ready, its experience (World of 82 in Spain, JJ.OOO in Barcelona in 1992, Copa de Europa in 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
However, the gloomy economic and financial prospects of both countries could bring their ambitions down.
The possible reprisals against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal all they can do is give points to Russia, converted into an outsider of weight despite the gaps in its candidacy (stages, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to move to Zurich and has denounced an "unfair competence in the preparation of the vote", in a direct reference to the accusations of the English press against the members of the EC.
"They're taking out their dirty rags, trying to compromise them," Putin said.
By 2022, the United States, which has the experience of 1994, seems to be the most logical favorites.
The first world economic power and headquarters of the main sponsors of FIFA, the country seems to be giving Japan and South Korea an advantage, which have separately developed an excellent project.
However, these new nominations seem premature for two countries that together organized the championship in 2002.
Another risk: the granting of the 2026 World Cup to China, strongly desired by FIFA, which would cause Asia to run out of way for 2022.
Together with Qatar, which has presented its project based on futuristic stages, and Australia, FIFA would continue to expand to new horizons, but both countries present more risks than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also be affected by the weakness of TV rights paid (depending on the time difference) by European countries, the backbone of the FIFA war.
Second mandate: evidence
De Gaulle had really doubted.
Mitterrand had made it clear that he doubted.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had no doubt about it.
And Nicolas Sarkozy less still.
One mandate in Elisha leads to another.
Therefore, the current head of state will be re-en candidate in 2012.
However, the evidence of this is not well combined with the mystery usually associated with the presidential function.
Therefore, you always have to appear to be in doubt.
To one side and to the other.
In 2006, although they did not believe it, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that he did not discard a third mandate.
On 15 November, seriously, Nicolas Sarkozy indicated that he would make his decision "at some point in the autumn of 2011".
Therefore, the fact that you deal with UMP Members, on Tuesday night in Elisha, the possibility of "two mandates" has caused some resurgence.
Is this the official announcement of your application?
Not much less.
The president only indicated that the 2008 constitutional reform limited the number of five-year terms of office to two.
It simply conveys the facts, not an ad.
It's not the first time he talks about the presidents, with a playful tone, at meetings like this.
"In the worst, or better, of the cases, you will still spend seven and a half years with me," he released in July 2009.
On another occasion, in May 2010: "You don't think I don't think about what comes next."
His claims of yesterday no longer draw him closer to the candidacy, nor less.
Comments are issued for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race by the PS candidacy, on the one hand.
But it is not the fact that Segolène Royal has gone up to the gym what leads Nicolas Sarkozy to be honest.
Rather than the contrary; the fact that his candidacy in 2012 is evident is what leads many PS people to claim that the battle is organized before it is anticipated.
On the other hand, the bad probes.
For the first time, right-wing voters prefer François Fillon's candidacy to Nicolas Sarkozy's ( 46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and in the UMP there is no discussion on the subject," he has responded immediately and prudently to the Prime Minister's environment.
"If you think you can lose, you won't be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"You always think you can win," corrects Alain Juppé, resigned to the evidence.
Euro: The ECB is obliged to maintain its acquisitions of State Letters
The last meeting of the Board of Governors of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should allow for the clarification of the modalities for exiting the crisis or at least for announcing the interruption of a large number of non-conventional monetary policy operations which should end at the end of the year.
Because of the European sovereign debt crisis, the Frankfurt Emission Institute will certainly not be allowed to be so peremptory if it does not want to risk aggravating a more complicated situation today in European bond markets.
The political cost would be equally high.
Yesterday, during a press conference, the French Minister of Finance, Christine Lagarde, supported the ECB's active role in resolving the debt crisis in the European States.
He did not mean to say whether he felt that the central bank should do more, for example by increasing its programme for the purchase of State obligations.
"I reserve my opinion for my fellow Europeans."...
In Brussels, during its hearing before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, was not more eloquent about his intentions, indicating only that the State Letter purchase programme on the secondary market "continued" and that "we will see what we decided" during the Thursday meeting.
The only thing that remains clear is that the ECB will maintain its main invariable type at 1%, the lowest level of its history since May 2009.
In practice, the acquisition of Treasury obligations by the ECB has doubled last week to some EUR 1,350 million.
In addition, according to the indiscreet market operators, it would have bought Irish and Portuguese titles again yesterday.
In total, the Eurosystem central banks have acquired securities of EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt that purchases will follow (see page 29).
Economists do not foresee any significant change of course either.
Although lending operations at more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB’s arsenal, the ECB still makes unlimited liquidity allocations to beneficial conditions and durations ranging from one week to three months.
Economists expect this device to be extended today for a few months.
"I can't imagine he's going to change his program considerably."
"If not, it would be risky to provoke new tensions in the short term," says Michael Schubert, economist of the Commerzbank.
"It seems more likely that there will be a progressive release announced during the first quarter of 2011", anticipates Norbert Bräms, economist in Sal.
Oppenheim.
In relation to interventions on the public debt market, "the ECB should maintain a purchase volume of these obligations in order to keep the market stable," says Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of European banks' exposures to euro area sovereign debt markets, the issuing institution has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It must compensate at any price for the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way that it prevents a marked rise in the yields paid by the weaker states," said an important bond manager yesterday.
Because, if interest rates are put in the clouds, States will have even more problems to reduce their indebtedness, or even to stabilize it.
This is the price of protecting the euro.
In Italy, the government of Berlusconi cape the temporal
After Italy started the week in a disturbing way, the situation slightly improved yesterday with the fall of the types of obligations to 10 years.
A recovery from precarious calm.
At the start of a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional presidents have stated that they have heard Giulio Tremonti describe the situation as "indecipherable" and that a "unforeseen" weekend was expected, which was later denied by the person concerned.
In any event, on Tuesday, the difference with the German long-term rates had reached the record figure of 210 basic points and the price of contracts for coverage against bankruptcy risk (CCR) had been fired up to 263 points, leading to a certain review in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi commented that, in Spain, the difference with German types was more than 400 basic points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, was "deeply concerned" about "the turbulence in the markets" and a possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it's like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
In fact, its problem is the lack of growth and the stagnation of income associated with it, which causes the State to run the risk of not being able to meet its funding needs.
The latest Brussels forecasts have generated a cold water tank for the government.
It is estimated that Italian growth will reach 1.1 per cent in 2011 and 1.4 per cent in 2012, while the budget currently under consideration in the Senate is based on figures of 1.3 per cent and 2 per cent, respectively.
Under these conditions, according to the European Commission, the public deficit will represent 4.3 per cent of GDP next year (compared to 3.9 per cent by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7 per cent).
Hence the rumor that new budgetary provisions could be applied after the parties, for a sum of EUR 7 billion.
"Where necessary, further austerity measures must be taken", says Economic Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn.
For the time being, Italy has the support of international institutions.
"The bases of your economy are in order and your accounts are in good condition, as we have been saying for a long time," says Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund responsible for Italy in the IMF.
"There is no immediate problem, either in the short or long term, because despite its considerable debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts requested from Italy are smaller than those required from other countries," says Pier Carlo Padaan, OECD chief economist.
The problem of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the Chamber of Deputies, after which elections could be anticipated at the end of March.
In such a case, a period would not be conducive to decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on the strengthening of mechanisms to combat the crisis
Christine Lagarde has already repeated this yesterday during a press conference in Paris: "I think we have already shown on Sunday, at night and in the day that Europeans are clearly solidarityal, determined, committed to defending their currency and their monetary area."
Although it was relative, yesterday's relaxation in the types of European States' obligations has moved governments and the ECB.
However, we cannot yet talk about a principle of standardization.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's announced that it could lower the rating of Portugal's debt, the most common target today of speculation.
"As in May, political clarity and transparency are really lacking, which significantly affects banking systems," the economists of Exane BNP Paribas say.
Especially because "political rhythm is much slower than the pace of markets".
Aware of this outbreak and the dangers it hides, European countries are intensifying their debates to strengthen the exit mechanisms of the already existing crisis.
Informal consultations among Finance Ministers that are more directly affected and, in general, with their G-20 counterparts are on the right track.
And this also taking into account the meetings of the Eurogroup and the Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB meets today.
On the agenda, the type of non-conventional measures to support euro area countries in the collimator of markets (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Fund (EFEF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, has started a tour of Asia on Tuesday in Singapore to inform investors from the Far East about the developments in the crisis in Europe.
Although the objective of these visits is not to raise funds, it certainly prepares the ground.
It is expected that the first EDF securities will be issued next month.
Yesterday, an American official representative has entrusted to Reuters agency that the United States would support a potential increase in funds mobilized through an additional direct IMF commitment.
As for the countries on the front line, Portugal and Spain, they are prepared to adopt structural reforms, particularly in relation to the organisation of the labour market.
These reforms are added to austerity measures with a closer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to move on a path different from that followed by Greece and Ireland.
They both want to avoid at all costs seeking international aid before applying their own budgetary corrections and deciding on the structural reforms they consider essential to build confidence on a lasting basis.
Finally, the capitalist partners of the European funds pose the options available to accelerate the process of standardisation of public bond markets.
Passing through Paris, on 24 November, Axel Weber was the first to launch the idea that, if the EUR 750,000 million mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to take out the portfolio again.
The economists of Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European public debt market, consider that an additional amount of about €100 billion would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of direct liquidity injection.
There is the instrument for this: the European financial stabilisation mechanism, currently equipped with EUR 60 billion.
A council that would undoubtedly be able to examine the European capitals in detail.
Especially if the market conditions get worse.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in orange alert
Snows continue to cause circulation difficulties, especially in the secondary network in Britain, and may affect various economic activities.
Currently, twenty-four departments are on orange alert due to the risk of snow and ice formation.
Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have joined the twenty departments that were already on alert orange, eighteen from Wednesday to noon and two, Dordogne and Gironde, joined the group at night.
According to Metéo France, the heavy snowfalls affect the north of Gironde and Charentes, although it also slightly snows on the island of France.
A layer of snow between 2 and 5 cm is expected, occasionally between 7 and 10 cm, in the departments concerned, and between 1 and 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm, in the Parisian region.
The departments affected are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those in the regions of Baja Normandy, Isla de France and Lemosín.
The snows are strong enough to cause movement difficulties and affect certain economic activities, alert Weather France.
In the Côtes d'Armor, access to several departmental roads to heavy vehicles of more than 7.5 tonnes has been prohibited, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes.
According to the gendarmes, circulation in Britain's secondary network is complicated, so they recommend that it not be driven safely in case of need and the movement of certain TER vehicles has been banned during the day.
On Thursday, school transportation in Picardia has been banned.
No specific measures were planned on Wednesday night to limit the movement of heavy vehicles.
Prefecture "calls on all drivers to drive with greatest caution on the roads and to adapt their driving to the situation".
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked airlines to cancel on Thursday 25% of their flights at Roissy Paris airport and 10% in Orly because of the planned snows.
DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro del Grand Paris: First Financial Drafts · Global Voices
Since the debate on modernising transport on the island of France has reached its high point, it has rained billions.
At least in the debate.
In particular, we talk about the 23 billion for the Grand Paris subway that must build the Société du Grand Paris.
To start this GSP, the State has announced an allocation of €4 billion.
At the theoretical level, this sum will be the sum that will later allow the GSP to obtain loans in the markets to finance a part of its double loop.
Today, at last, we have the first accounts.
The 2010 Correctional Finance Act, which was discussed in the Finance Committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains the arrangements to find the first part of that money.
There are two ways: creating a special equipment tax and increasing office tax on the Island of France.
The first, as we read in article 15 of the draft law, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
In addition, it is set in numbers: "The product of this tax is EUR 117 million per year".
The second is a modification of an office tax that already exists "to modernize it, increase its product and allocate this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would you get with this method?
Who knows.
There are no figures in the text.
But it's away from 4,000 million.
"Tax resources are required to be added to the €4 billion of the allocation of funds that will mobilize the State and will be granted to the Société du Grand Paris as the project moves forward," we can read in the explanatory statement.
The GSP is not surprised at this system.
"From the moment income is created (the two taxes, ndlr), we can cover the studies for three years and then receive the 4,000 million later, as we explain."
"It will be recorded in the budget and used according to needs."
The GSP estimates that it will start receiving the 4,000 million in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This device, in which the promised 4,000 million do not appear on the credit, can lead to a slightly lit parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be held on 7 December.
Avenger hackers and diligent spies
The WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On the one hand, it unveils an apparent scandal, a scandal that only seems scandalous in the face of hypocrisy governing relations between States, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes on an international scale and provides for a future dominated by regression.
But let's step by step.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is confirmation of the fact that each file created by a secret service (independent of the nation to which it belongs) is made up exclusively of press clippings.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual customs only reflect what has been written for months in any newspaper (except those belonging to Berlusconi) and the sinisterly ridiculous profile of Khadafi has been giving Cabaret artists ideas for creating their sketches for a long time.
The rule that secret files should only be formed by news of public knowledge is essential for the dynamics of secret services, and not just in this century.
If you visit a bookstore dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that every work repeats (about the Grial, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templars or the Rosacruz) exactly what had been written in the previous works.
This is not only because the authors of occult texts do not want to do unpublished research (or do not know where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who dedicate themselves to the occult not only trust what they already know, which confirms what they have already learned.
This is the mechanism of Dan Brown's success.
The same applies to secret files.
The informant is fearful, just as he is fearful (or has little anxiety) the head of the secret services (if he could not be, I know, editor of the Liberation), which only considers true what he can recognize.
The top secret information about Berlusconi sending the U.S. embassy from Rome to the State Department was the same as the newsweek published the previous week.
Why, then, have the revelations of these files caused such a revolt?
On the one hand, they only say what every cultivated person already knows, i.e. that embassies, at least since World War II and since Heads of States can call by phone or catch the plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic role and, with the exception of some limited exercises of representation, have become spy centres.
Any viewer who sees research films knows perfectly, just pretend we don't know it because of hypocrisy.
In any case, repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy and gives a poor image of American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that a hacker anyone can consult the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world has a significant impact on the prestige of the State Department.
The scandal therefore affects both the victims and the "greens".
But let us enter into the true nature of what has happened.
Formerly, in Orwell's time, he could conceive of all power as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy has come true since he was able to control every move thanks to the phone, every transaction made, hotel visited, highway taken, the citizen became a complete victim of the power eye.
But when it is shown, as is now, that even the crypts of the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control relationship ceases to be unidirectional and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen (at least the hacker, chosen as the avenger of citizens) can know all the secrets of power.
How can one stand a power that can no longer keep his own secrets?
It is true, as Georg Simmel already said, that a true secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be unveiled); it is also true that all knowledge about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually an empty secret, without secret, since it comes from the public sphere; but revealing, as WikiLeaks has done, that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets means taking away all power.
WikiLeaks has done no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but yes, and much, to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound caused to such a powerful power?
It is clear that in the future, States will no longer be able to put any reserved information into the network, as it would be like publishing it in a street poster.
But it is also clear that, with current technologies, confidential telephone conversations cannot be expected.
Nothing is easier than to find out if and when a Head of State has moved by plane and contacted one of the counterparts.
How can they maintain private and confidential relations in the future?
I know perfectly well that, for the moment, my prediction is a matter of science fiction and therefore novelism, but I imagine government agents moving discreetly in due course with uncontrollable itineraries, carrying messages that have been learned from memory or, like much, hiding some data written in the heels of their shoes.
This information is then preserved, in a single copy, in locked drawers: in the end, the Watergate spying attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
In the past, I have written that technology is now advancing like a crab, that is, backward.
A century after the cableless telegraph has revolutionized communications, the Internet has re-created a telegraph with cables (telephones).
Video tapes (analogs) had allowed film researchers to study a film step by step, moving forward and backward, discovering all the secrets of the assembly, while now the CDs (digitals) only allow to move forward or back from chapter to chapter, i.e. to enormous proportions.
With high-speed trains, we can go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, with the travels it takes, we need three and a half hours.
Therefore, it is nothing unusual for politics and communication techniques to take us back to horse cars.
One last comment.
In the past, the press was trying to understand what was secretly happening at the embassies.
Currently, it is the embassies who request confidential information from the press.
Climate: French hats in their funding pledges
A year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to examine whether the rapidly unblocked funding promises (called fast start or early) made by developed countries have been respected.
And the French hats have been unveiled.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries pledged $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union pledged to contribute EUR 7.2 billion in three years and EUR 1.260 million in France (i.e. EUR 420 million per year).
During the opening of COP16, the EU has put on the table its best letters to convince its partners that its commitment to fast start financing is true: a report detailing the measures of its Member States, a press conference, a major complementary event, the distribution of leaflets...
The transparent operation was appreciable and was appreciated for what is really worth: developing countries and civil society would want all developed countries to do the same and at the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released 2010 €2.2 billion, which sets it on the right path towards fulfilling its commitment of €7.2 billion in 2012.
But, if we study the situation in detail, things are more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Agreement, the money must be "new and additional" to ensure that a complementary effort is made, without prejudice to official development aid.
Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached on what "new and additional" means.
When the European Commission proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
At present, each one chooses the best reference.
For example, the European Commission has taken as a reference the year 2009: international funding is maintained and 150 million is added in three years as fast start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references for the year or level of official development assistance.
On the contrary, France considers that the financing of "all new projects" of the year 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, no reference is made to expenditure in previous years or to the total level of official development assistance.
In particular, the total amount of France's aid to developing countries can remain stable (or even shrink), while it intends to respect its commitment to "new and additional" funds...
Another crucial element, the distribution of donations and loans.
Again, there is no standard and each one chooses the method of calculation.
Some, such as France, believe that each euro provided is equivalent to one euro donated.
Obviously, this is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
While the use of loans may be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often, projects related to the reduction of emissions that are based on more efficient technologies), it is meant to present a euro that will be recovered as equivalent to a euro that is donated... As a matter of fact, only the cost of the loan for the country granting the loan should be calculated for its commitments (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France does not find such reasoning useful: "respect" its commitment of EUR 420 million by making 91.5 % of loans (EUR 389.8 million) and 8.5% of donations (EUR 36.1 million); see the EU document for its own eyes.
This is the only Union country that uses the loan so frequently.
Germany uses it in 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands and Slovakia, among others, respect their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the majority of the European Union provides a euro to fulfil its commitment, France only provides 10 cents and considers the effort to be comparable.
That's a good trick!
In short, in its fast start financing, France has double abuse: on the one hand, in relation to the actions in time and, on the other, in relation to the real financial effort.
By spending only EUR 36.1 million, it can give the impression that it costs 420 million "new and additional", as promised.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that Bercy has taken over arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why were the other Member States still giving when they can just lend?) and in the negotiations, since developing countries are not dumb...
The chapter on early funding is a relatively short-term statement in relation to all climate negotiations.
But it could be an extra sand grain in the immense machinery that is the UNFCCC.
Let's hope it doesn't.
Whatever it is, it is essential to learn from this first year of early funding.
First, France could announce a change in its calculation method for the years 2011 and 2012, with the intention of respecting its commitments and in the same way as the other countries of the European Union.
But, especially, France could make progress in the discussions on bets at stake in relation to long-term financing (another essential chapter currently under discussion): we will not get rid of the question of the "additional character" or the method of calculating loans.
France could change its position to become as progressive on this issue as it is with others.
So we have the hope of the new Minister of the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancún next week.
A surprise announcement about France's fast start and its vision of the "additional character" and the use of loans would help improve the level of international confidence needed to advance the negotiations.
Children ' s Pesticide Warning
A 10-year-old child ingested 81 different chemical substances, according to a study published on Wednesday by the Generations Futures Association (the old movement for the rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which warns that its results "do not have a significant statistical value taking into account the limited number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem dealt with," acquired in supermarkets in Oise and Paris between July and September food that usually consumes a child of about ten years in four meals and a tentpies a day.
These foods taken as a model, which respect the official recommendations (five parts of fresh fruits and vegetables, three of dairy products and 1.5 liters of water per day), as well as the goblins, were examined in the laboratories in search of chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other contaminants.
The balance of the plate is overwhelming: 81 chemical substances, of which 42 classified as possible or probable carcinogens and five substances classified as safe carcinogens, as well as 37 substances capable of acting as endocrine disruptors (EP), according to studies from various institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Although virtually all of the cases do not exceed the legal limits for each of the chemical substances individually, our study clearly shows that exposure of consumers to potentially carcinogenic and/or PE pollutants is worrying," says the association.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogenic wastes and three considered safe carcinogens, as well as about a dozen residues that can harm the hormone system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, intended as tentampié for school, contains traces of six chemical substances, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to the green Jews in Kenya, including food, where the study has detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, Russian fillet, canned tuna and even bread bar or gum were attached to pesticides and other chemicals.
In the tap water, the analyses discovered the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon shoot was the most "nutritive" with 34 chemical wastes detected and even the analysis of the plastic dish used to heat the food in the microwave was not completely clean.
The final risk generated by these "contaminant cocktails" for the consumer is "probably underestimated," says the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV), for its part, has proposed "in the face of the gravity of the situation" to apply a moratorium on the use of pesticides to curb "increasing diseases associated with civilization".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EASA) indicated the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 in cereals.
