At the end of the exchange, the Prague grant is going down in the negative
After the fall of Tuesday morning, the Prague stock exchange rectified its losses.
Transactions with ČEZ shares reached almost half of the usual daily exchanges.
Tuesday, from the beginning of the trade, the Prague stock exchange renewed with its fall of the day before, when it lost almost six percent.
This time, the decline is due to the fall in shares on Wall Street.
The reaction of the market to the result of the vote of the House of Representatives of the United States, which refused to adopt the stabilisation plan of the US financial sector, is also perceptible to us.
Actions crash in Asia
The Asian scholarships experience a dramatic fall on Tuesday, even though the indexes succeeded, during the day, to erase some of the losses.
Hongkong stock exchange index lost four percent during trade, but later, it wiped out some of the losses and reduced the decrease to nearly 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index following the Chinese stock movement of the Hongkong stock market lost 3.8 percent, with markets closed in Shanghai.
Sydney stock lost more than five percent, but eventually we managed to reduce losses to 4.3 percent.
According to her index, the Taiwan Stock Exchange loses 3.6 percent.
"Hesitation about the US rescue action will affect the financial markets of the world," notes Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong monetary office.
Although Hong Kong was part of China, it established its own monetary policy, that is, independently of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are the same as in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, US legislators should quickly resume negotiations and adopt the proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, other countries might be affected.
The bloodbath of American shares
Monday, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the financial system support project, to which it should have devoted up to $700 billion (about 12 billion from Kč).
The legislators thus rejected the call for the support of President George Bush's project.
According to Bush, the project is expected to solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. shares live on Monday, a bloodbath and the main indexes of shares have been the biggest drop in the last 20 years.
The Dow Jones index lost nearly seven percent, with a fall of such a size for the last time in 1987.
The index was already lost during the vote, but when it appeared that the proposal was not adopted, it was in a free fall.
Congress ceda: the U.S. government can inject 700 billion dollars into banks
The leaders of the US Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of the financial assistance agreement to the US financial system.
It will be put to the vote at the beginning of next week.
The U.S. legislators made a decisive turning point in the discussions on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of financial assistance of $700 billion (about 12 billion krona), granted to the U.S. financial system.
Success is not, however, certain.
In fact, before the final version of the Act can be published and put to the vote, Congressmen must complete a number of details of the agreement.
The financial system support plan will be discussed on Monday in the House of Representatives.
On Sunday at Reuters Barney Frank, the chairman of the House's Banking and Financial Regulatory Committee.
According to sources, on Wednesday at the earliest, the plan should be put to the vote in the Senate.
According to economists, the announcement that the rescue plan will be adopted should be a major psychological factor in reversing financial markets.
However, given the complexity of the mechanisms through which market aid can be effective, it will follow a "disillusion".
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made a great deal of progress.
We have resolved our divergent views on the shape that the package of measures should have for the stabilisation of the market," entrusts the Bloomberg Agency with the Democrat Nancy Pelosi.
In her opinion, the final vote could be taken on Sunday.
On Saturday night through Sunday, representatives of the legislators met with the US Finance Minister Henry Paulson, to give the bottom of the government a final form.
It should buy from financial corporations the real estate assets that lead to significant losses and threaten the stability of the system as a whole.
"We are about to agree on a plan that will work and must also be effective in the market.
We still need to continue this market recovery plan, but I think we're there," said Paulson.
A signal for Asian trade
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on declining stock markets.
According to the Democratic Senator, Harry Reid does not escape, the legislators make the Congress reach a final agreement on Sunday.
In this way, they want to calm investors before the start of trade in Asian financial markets, which are located in the first time zone, where the Congress's decision could affect trade on Monday.
However, it is now impossible to specify with certainty when the two Houses of American Congress will proceed to the vote, or if negotiations are not likely to remain blocked, at the last moment, by a certain problem.
The legislators hope that it will be adopted in the coming days.
Nevertheless, the Act will still be subject to several amendments.
The total amount for the system shall be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion, as President George Bush wished, must be available as soon as possible.
But if Congress has the impression that the program does not perform its function, it has the possibility to block the remaining amount, following two steps: first, $100 billion additional, and then, to end, $350 billion.
Mr. Bush welcomed progress in the negotiations
Although the President can put his veto on this decision, Congress, he has the opportunity to put it as a minority.
Despite these changes, the main idea of the program, which was to obtain finance for the purchase of bad real estate securities, whose value dropped, because hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to pay their mortgages, was maintained.
"All the work is done.
The House of Representatives should be in a position to vote on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
American President George Bush himself is pleased with the progress in the negotiations.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said that Mr Bush was pleased with the progress made on Saturday and appreciated "the bipartite effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy".
Limitation of golden parachutes
The chairman of the banking committee of the Senate Christopher Dodd, the chief negotiator, said that the legislators agreed on the responsibility of the financial program, the protection of contributors against losses, the discount agreement, the progress of the plan on the time axis.
The new Act also provides for the limitation of such golden parachutes for directors of companies participating in the programme and establishes a committee to monitor the fund.
The latter should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on the issue and made significant progress towards an agreement that will walk and will be effective for the market and for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also provides assistance for real estate owners, who have problems paying.
The government should negotiate new bills in the case of mortgages that it will buy, while reducing the monthly payments of debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological aid
According to the economic leader of Patria Finance David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but its achievement will be very difficult.
"This is due to the fact that we do not know what will be the mechanism and the price of the acquisition of assets with problems.
This point will be decisive to decide on the sharing of losses between the financial sector and the government," said Marek, this week, on the iHNed.cz server.
If the plan is adopted now, or at the beginning of next week, it is not so important, according to Marek.
"It is much more important that congressmen agree, as early as this week, that they support this plan and that we will devote it as soon as possible.
This psychological significance of the agreement, providing for the adoption of the plan, is most important at the moment," emphasized Marek.
An extreme struggle: MP3 players against mobile devices.
We'll advise you, how to choose
While virtually all mobile devices can read MP3 files, no MP3 player can call.
It seems to be clear that it is better to buy only one phone.
Do not prevent there are sufficient reasons to obtain an independent reader.
The choice depends entirely on the mode of use and on the requirements of the future owner.
It would be absurd to buy for the house an expensive high-end gramophone to put on the new album of Maxim Turbulenc.
On the one hand, such musical products do not come out on vinyl disc, and, from the point of view of quality, there is no objective reason for this to happen.
Now, if you have on your shelves vinyl disks embedded, with rock art, jazz or blues, you probably dream at least of such a gramophone.
It is the same with music during travels, namely compressed music, to say it in a simplified way - of MP3 music.
There are also categories based on price and quality.
For one, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for a reader, just as a Pink Floyd fan would have trouble supporting listeners purchased for twenty crowns in the market.
These are two extremes, among which there is enough room for everyone.
The choice is wide.
Battery life is also decisive
Some high-end music readers are capable of much more than just reading music, but these are unknown functions, of course, of most mobiles.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
Apart from the first functions, telephone calls and text sending, it is able to read music and films, record them, it has a variable quality camera and can, for example, even be used for navigation.
And if you take into account smartphones and communicators, you'll have a small computer in your pocket.
Since no fryer knows how to grill meat and no TV will take photographs, we are practically witnessing a miracle.
However, the universal character of the mobile is not without inconvenience.
The larger the number of functions you use, the greater the interval between two reloads will be reduced.
And the reading of music is one of the most important goinflies of energy.
There are few mobiles that are able to read music for ten to twelve hours, in most cases this figure is significantly lower.
In this regard, music readers (especially the most rudimentary) are significantly more effective.
In the case of cheap mobiles, count that they will only play music for a few hours.
If, in addition, you happen to call from time to time, look for, to be sure, a second reload for the job - which is even valid for the more expensive devices.
This problem will not arise for MP3 players who are capable, as a result of reloading, of continuous operation of at least 9 hours, including the least performing.
Another problem occurs when recording music in the mobile.
Unfortunately, that a limited part of the devices has a universal USB connector, especially since not all can be directly connected to the computer, without special software.
Of course, it is possible to record music directly on the memory card, but few card readers are able to take it without reduction, given the minute dimensions of the memory cards used in the mobiles.
With regard to readers, you do not need, except with the exception (iPod), any software.
Simply fill in, through the USB connector, the music device from the computer.
Most of the furniture and readers will create themselves a media library classified according to the name of the interpreter, the title of the album, the style, or then the user's judgment.
Some devices display only an index with a tree structure, in the way Windows Explorer does, others are capable of both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent phones with operating system).
Readers are easier to handle, mobile have more know-how
In the choice of a concrete device, you are particularly interested in the lifespan of the accumulator, memory capacity, quality and type of output of the sound and, of course, the ease of control.
If music is for you, essentially, a background noise and if in the day you will listen to it that for a limited time, for example by taking the tram, you just need any mobile reading the MP3s.
Practically all the furniture is now capable of it.
You don't even have to pay too much attention to music formats that the mobile or the reader is able to read.
All come to read the MP3 and the vast majority of the music that will reach until you will have this format.
It is part of the most popular formats and apart from it, the vast majority of devices also read WMA music.
The AAC (format used by the Apple firm and its iPods) is less common.
The high-end furniture also allows, for example, the purchase of online music.
Just visit, from the mobile phone, the corresponding operator's web pages (or those of another supplier) and buy the song or album in question.
This service alone should be a convincing reason for acquiring a musical mobile.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is miserable and in most cases, it is limited to fast-run radio tubes.
The prices are not the lowest either.
However, it is generally considered that this way of buying music (either by GSM, the internet, or even by wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always wear their furniture on themselves.
Every time you want to listen to something, you just have to get out of your pocket, while you forgot your MP3 player at home.
However, it is also important if you always have earphones on you or a handscreen with connection.
If this is not the case, you can use the built-in enclosures, which have almost all the furniture, but a minimum of MP3 players.
For many, the main advantage of musical furniture is their price.
The cheaper ones normally cost less than three thousand.
For a price of three four thousand crowns, we can already have a very convenient walkman.
In most cases, however, you will be limited by the absence of an output for ordinary listeners.
The price of the best and best used phones, with also an entrance for ordinary listeners, does not exceed fifteen thousand.
The readers, on the other hand, have the advantage of having an easy order.
Really anyone comes to ensure the command of the most rudimentary readers - which do not necessarily match the less expensive (see our choice).
A minimum of functions; and the similarity of the control with that of a cassette post, commonly used in the past, or of a gramophone, is obvious.
There is no risk of collision in the form of a random-connected mobile internet, followed by a huge data transmission bill.
Which device to choose
Even the cheapest mobiles (e.g. Vodafone 527) generally have an exchangeable memory card slot (type M2, microSD, and so on).
Even taking into account the additional purchase of such a card, you will not exceed two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
Basic models normally only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive do it even with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a Cow, a Creative, a Sony, a Samsung, an Emgeton, or an iriver.
Depending on capacity (max. 2 GB), you should not spend more than 1 100 crowns.
If you are one of the most demanding listeners, choose specialized walkman mobiles (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices are equipped with independent control keys for MP3, and this is how easy the control is to approach that of an independent MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose walkman series mobiles have the same user menu as MP3 players sold separately, is the one that went the most in this field.
The same service, in the same price category, but with a memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and a lifespan of the accumulator (normally 15 hours, up to 35 hours) higher, is provided by an MP3 player produced by one of the marks mentioned above.
A first virtual operator will win the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The mobile market in Czech Republic is relatively advanced, our operators offering virtually the same services as their partners in Western Europe.
Despite this, we still lack something - a virtual operator, which would force conventional operators to lower prices.
Maybe he won't be missing for long.
We have already mentioned, on several occasions, the fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
ČTú (The Czech Telecommunications Office), which reported that the price of a SMS was higher in us than in the rest of the Union, confirmed it.
Thus, as a result of the last step taken by the European Commission in the field of roaming charges regulation, a paradoxical situation is likely to occur - SMS sent from abroad will be for some customers of Czech mobile operators less expensive than in the country.
How is it possible that the prices in Czech Republic remain so high, in comparison with Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that would really like to enter the fight.
This may seem paradoxical, given that we still have three mobile networks and a penetration that far exceeds 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this case, Pavel Dvořák, the President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTú), who stated several times that in Czech there was no room for another operator, choruses with operators.
It is probably true that a classic operator with its own network seems to have a lot more chance (in fact, now it would only find very difficult frequencies).
However, there is still a possibility - a virtual operator.
It is precisely the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that led to a considerable decline in prices, to which the traditional operators had to respond as well.
However, even before the arrival of the party disturbances such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market, voices similar to those that are heard today at home would be heard in Britain.
However, it appeared that there was still room for such operators and that they could have a real success.
We are not obliged to go too far to find examples.
In February we informed you of the launch in Poland of the Virtual Operator Mobilking.
In just six months, this operator managed to win more than 100 thousand customers and become the fifth operator in the country.
Let's add that behind Mobilking, there's the Penta financial group, which has, among other things, the U:fon in Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual operators is that they can focus on a much more concrete target group.
For their operation to be effective, they need a lot less customers than a classic operator.
They are, in fact, free from the relatively high costs of construction, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
Thus, in the world, virtual operators profile themselves as low-cost operators - they offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often counterbalanced by a limited service offer.
For example, Tesco Mobile offers text messages in Britain at least twice as expensive as its competitors.
But, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, placing on an unusual target group can also be a good boost.
Indeed, this operator specifically targets men.
"The real men choose Mobilking - an operator they like and can trust," said David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, operator of this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say, if such a concept would be able to walk also at home.
Miroslav Čepický, the spokesman for Vodafone, undoubtedly: "The Czech market is relatively small for a segmentary approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
More and more, it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the provision of services."
In Czech, no chance, say mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if there will be a virtual operator in Chechnya, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are discussing the expansion of this project to success, but in Czech negotiations are not very encouraging.
Mobilking will be launched in other countries in our area," said in a telephone entertainment for Mobil.cz Jana Studničková, spokesperson for the Penta financial group.
It therefore indirectly confirmed that the operators in Czech Republic were, in any case, not in favour of this idea.
On the contrary, they are trying to do their best to ensure that a potential competitor cannot appear.
The Novera GTS group, who would like to take a new step in order to become a real competitor of Telefonika in the business customer field, has not been hiding, for long enough, its intention to launch a virtual mobile operator.
"We have a lot to be able to offer our customers not only fixed, but also mobile, telecommunications services.
And the sooner the better.
We have already conducted negotiations on this possibility on several occasions with all Czech mobile operators.
With some, we have succeeded in the negotiations," said Pavel Kaidl's spokesperson.
The future may therefore be promising.
According to non-official information, it seems that we might be able to welcome the first virtual operator by the end of the year.
But for now, its creation is accompanied by complete silence.
"At the moment, we do not believe that there is room in the Czech market for a virtual operator as such.
The Czech market is in comparison with other very specific ones.
At the moment, no subject with a complex and serious project in this area has contacted us," Vlastimil Sršeň of the press department of Telefonika O2, mentioned in his statement for Mobil.cz.
Other operators also relate to the specificities of the Czech market.
The spokesperson for T-Mobile Martina Kemrová states in a rare agreement with the statement of O2: "We have not currently registered a viable and bilaterally beneficial project, which could serve as a basis."
And she adds: "It is practically excluded for a virtual operator to appear in the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
To operate in such a limited time, we should now have a concrete agreement."
Vodafone instead directs his attention to the completion of requests to obtain his own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický said in relation to this: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and especially in the area of shared costs and infrastructure.
That is what we believe is the most valuable contribution from the point of view of the clients.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is the discovery of a partner to establish a common network for a fast mobile internet."
Responsible authorities: in phase with operators
The approach of mobile operators is easily understandable, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would have led to lower prices and thus to a decrease in their profit.
So how good is it to facilitate the advent of such a competitor?
When it comes to their interests, the operators can understand themselves as larvae in the fair. The chicane accompanying the creation of the U:fon also testifies to this.
The greatest apparent pressure on ČTU, when creating the U:fon, was that exerted by the T-Mobile company.
This is evidenced by information available to the public from ČTú websites.
Today, however, the U:fon stands ready to use as an argument not to accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová noted: "The competition in the mobile market has also been recently expanded by the entry into the market of a fourth mobile operator.
Given the character of the mobile market in RT, it is clear that the entry of an additional player would, and above all, submit it to high requirements."
But given the attitude of these mobile operators, the indifference of Czech regulators seems disappointing.
However, it is not just the attitude of ČTú, which, unlike Britain and other developed countries, has unfortunately not the power to intervene in economic competition in Chechnya.
It belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (UOHS).
However, the latter adopts its typical position in the face of this problem.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible following the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the relevant virtual operator regarding the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No such agreement has been concluded for the moment, as the offer of potential stakeholders has not previously presented sufficient interest for conventional operators," stated in response to our question Kristián Chalupa of the UOHS Department of External Relations.
Such a statement would not surprise representatives of the operators.
But on the part of an office, which must represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, take care that no one takes advantage of its position on the market, such a statement is more than misleading.
Even more so, Kristián Chalupa adds: "To the outside, where virtual operators are normally present, it can be seen that their entry into the market has contributed to lower prices of mobile phone services."
However, pressing for an honest functioning of the market and lowering prices does not appear to be part of UOHS's interests.
What is indeed shocking is the almost touching agreement of the three mobile operators, which stems from their reactions.
The question is, if this is really a chance, it arises naturally.
In the same way, a price of gasoline that is strictly the same as all service stations is probably due to the chance and the hard fight of competition.
"The Office has not noted any signs of anticompetitive behaviour in this regard, so there is no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position, therefore none of them have an increased corresponding responsibility for their behaviour on the market.
The tools necessary for the opening up of the mobile market to virtual operators are probably missing even from the telecommunications regulator," said Chaloupa.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many points of disagreement.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by ČTU, according to which telecommunications is, from the point of view of economic competition, a single market.
None of the Czech operators have a dominant position on such a market.
However, some law experts offer another view of things: in order for the creation of a virtual operator to be possible, the consent of the network operator must be obtained at any time.
And the mobile operator quite logically has the monopoly on his network.
This is how he necessarily plays a dominant role in a certain segment of his activity.
However, even without admitting this argument, it should be at least worrying for the UOHS that three mobile operators proceed visibly in a similar manner.
However, complaints from many interested parties (including the Novera GTS, mentioned above) show that they face similar constraints in negotiations with all operators.
Taking responsibility for ČTú is a fairly common turn in communications, by which UOHS washes its hands.
We have already met with this type of attitude in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, the recently adopted Telecommunications Act was not successful in expanding the powers of ČTU in the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although many specialists promised to improve the situation.
The UOHS representatives must know this very well, but their interests are apparently elsewhere.
When no one's looking, it can work.
However, the operation of a sort of virtual pseudo-operators, many in Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
These are companies publishing their own price lists of mobile telephone services, but they are only public in part.
In most cases, it is a matter of firms dealing with multi-level marketing.
For example, special mobile phone services are offered by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
The price lists of these firms generally reach only elected ones.
The magic tour consists of the fact that the company makes before the operator is a classic business customer, who controls a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, she gets special (and other) price offers.
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such resale.
"If what you mentioned happened, it could be a breach of the contractual conditions that we would consider and which could lead to a halt in our collaboration with the society in question," answered our question on this issue Martina Kemrová.
However, it is unlikely that an echo of such activity will not reach the managers of mobile operators.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned, it can be thousands of customers.
No operator, however, decides against such a procedure.
Indeed, the activities of these companies bring them non-negligable benefits, and at the same time, as opposed to real virtual operators, they do not threaten them with their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický indicates possible problems: "The law allows such speculations, however, the services of these companies are only used by a percentage of negligible customers.
Moreover, they are forced to admit that the SIM card in their phone is not registered under their name, so they cannot fully dispose of it, in the way ordinary customers of mobile operators."
However, this is precisely what should seem strange to ČTU.
In addition, another question is asked at UOHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes on such a procedure, why do they block the creation of a virtual operator?
It should be added that UOHS has relatively wide powers to reveal such activity, and if it does not wish to be satisfied with the explanations of the operators, who claim to have no idea that this would occur, their contractual conditions prohibit it.
When we are no longer the most expensive country
As we have already mentioned on several occasions, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has led to a considerable decrease in the price of services.
However, in virtually all countries where virtual operators appeared, conventional operators sometimes tried to prevent their creation.
The arguments used by the latter were practically the same - a market too small, even too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
However, it was precisely at this level that the regulators, in developed countries, were involved, which did not defend the interests of mobile operators, but those of their clients.
Both by formal measures and by informal pressure, they eventually obtained the creation of a first virtual operator, followed by others.
Unfortunately, Czech regulators deal with this issue in the form of a hot potato to be disposed of by transmitting it to a near target.
Following the experiences we have, we cannot get rid of the feeling that confusion in skills is more beneficial to them in these cases than profitable.
But let's not throw the sleeve after the cog.
If the coulisse information is true and a virtual operator will soon appear in our home, the Czech mobile market may be in motion.
If one of the operators has accepted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, the UOHS can hardly remain impassible from the rejection (to discrimination) of other interested parties.
And we may cease to call more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four achievements of the new Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, on the occasion of Czech Citizenship Day, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek solemnly introduced the new recordings of the national anthem Kde domov můj (Where is my homeland?).
The anthem was again recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
We have four versions - with a male or female solo song, an interpretation with choir and an instrumental version.
The song is provided by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
Otakar Jeremiaš and Jaroslav Krček are the authors of the anthem's arrangements.
You can listen to the four new versions on the iHNed.cz server.
Bělohlávek sees Czech national song as one of the most beautiful hymns.
As he had previously entrusted Český rozhlas (Czech Public Radio), he chose to interpret the solo versions of the singers with young and representative voices, which are marked and appreciated.
"From the beginning, I tried to take care that the two singers, as well as the choir, have a good word, so that we understand the words, that they sing simultaneously," he said.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate next year's 175th anniversary.
For the first time in 1834, Kde domov sang on the plates of Stavovské divadlo (the State Theatre) in Fidlovačka (Kermesse des savetiers), a Czech original piece by Josef Kajetán Tyl, accompanied by the music of František Škroup.
It became popular and people spontaneously appropriated it.
After the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first couple naturally became an integral part of the national anthem.
It remained one of seven national symbols even after the creation of the Independent Czech Republic.
How the "new" hymn sounds
Pledging public transport (MHD) will introduce, on Wednesday, the flea into their ticketing system
On Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be recorded in the history of Pražský Dopravní podnik (the pragmatic transport agency) as the date on which they will ride in the subway, trams and buses the first passengers, who, instead of having a paper ticket, will have in their pocket an electronic coupon.
At the moment, it is accessible for about one hundred thousand people, owners of the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy a coupon 30 days or 90 days (this will be valid from 1 January 2009) and at the same time have it recorded on their chipboard in the information points and offices of Dopravní podnik (the Transportation Agency), located in the metro stations Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
From yesterday, there is also the possibility to buy the coupons on the Dopravní podnik web pages: www.dpp.cz.
Over four hundred people took advantage of the service in the morning.
Those who will start using the online store can permanently forget the windows at the metro stations, where they had to until now peddle in impatience in long queues in order to get tickets in paper.
Indeed, they will buy their coupon over the Internet and be recorded on their Opencard card in one of the thirteen Městská knihovna (municipal libraries).
"In these points of contact, there is a window available to passengers with trained staff, who will help interested people with internet purchase and, in addition, will record the coupon they purchased on their card," said project spokesman Martin Opatrný.
Next to libraries, it will also be possible to record the electronic coupons on the Opencard in automatic distributors installed in the vestibule of several metro stations.
What do these distributors look like?
They are red, recalling the machines to compose tickets and passengers may have already noticed them in the metro stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Today, the city has five, but by the end of the year, there should be eighty," said Opatrný.
Auto control the coupon instead of the driver
The machines that will work from tomorrow are easy to use.
Simply insert the Opencard chip card and the coupon previously purchased will register itself on the card.
The electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital but also in the vicinity of the city.
In the peri-urban trains and bus lines 300 to 499, which mainly use the inhabitants of the municipalities of central Bohemia to access the capital.
"In the integrated trains in Pražská integrovana doprava (integrated transports in Prague), the controllers are equipped with card readers, using which they establish the temporary and zonal validity of the coupons;" explained the control of Filip Drápal tickets of the Ropid organization, which design the schedules of the pragmatic public transports.
The suburban buses are equipped with cards readers integrated into the driver's seat.
When boarding it is therefore necessary not only to show the driver the chip card, but also to place the Opencard at the place indicated on the side of the box.
This is how the driver controls the validity of the coupons recorded.
"In case the passenger would need to verify the validity of the coupons registered, there is nothing simpler than to ask the driver for this information," Drápal added.
Passengers who do not take the peri-urban buses and will not remember the date when the validity of their coupon expires can again join automatic distributors, initially used to record the coupons on the map.
This is where the information on the validity of their document will be displayed on the screen of the device.
Sudanese Claimed a Referendum in the USA
The Swedes Germans in 1945 called for Šumava to be integrated into the United States.
This stems from a letter filed in the collections of the Jihočeská vědecká knihovna (The Scientific Library of the Southern Bohemian).
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want at least to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
In 1945, certain groups of Swedish Germans allegedly addressed the President of the USA with such a desire.
This results, among other things, from a letter preserved in a private archive, which is now deposited in the Jihočeská vědecká knihovna collections.
Germans from Český Krumlov, in the letter, ask the US President not to allow "šumavská župa" (forest region south of Bohemia) - annexed by Hitler under the Munich agreement - to be returned to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation well and want to be truly sure that the words proclaiming that the American troops come on German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," is written in the letter, "People, whose fate of Šumava is at heart."
Since the rally to Czechoslovakia is supposedly promising - knowing the Czech national character - only of brutality, attitude without regard, misunderstanding, oppression and servitude, the authors of the letter ask the US president to take into his hands the protection of Šumava for now and forever.
"We cannot believe, that you would grant this territory to a foreign state to us, which oppresses and destroys minorities and has not contributed in any way to the victory of the Allies without taking into account the opinion of the quarter of millions of inhabitants," is written in the letter.
The alleged reason why authors cannot sign the letter is the fear of the desire for revenge of "Czech oppressors".
If the President of the United States doubted the opinion of the Germans in Šumava, he would only have to organize, according to the authors of the letter, a referendum in the region to determine whether his inhabitants wanted to be part of the USA, or live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text in the letter can, given the current knowledge of post-war history, seem somewhat naive, according to some survivors, it illustrates well the expectations of the Swedes Germans of the time.
While the Czech Germans had to at least observe that the question of their expulsion from the Republic would arise, very few of them admitted such a possibility.
Some hoped that the United States and Great Britain would achieve a certain type of autonomy for the Sudan.
Others believed that they would just stay in Czechoslovakia.
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice, confirms it.
During the war, it was, as German of Česke Budějovice, engaged in the Navy in the Baltic countries.
When he was captured by the English at the end of the war and placed in the catch camp of the Holstein region, dozens of Czech Germans came to see him to teach them the Czech.
"They believed that once they returned home, the Czech would benefit them," said Chalupa.
None of the captured Germans who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war believed, according to him, that, following the Beneš Decrees, he would be expelled from the republic.
You don’t think about paying!
An emotional campaign will attack drivers
The most expensive road safety action in Czech history.
A way to characterize the emotional media campaign to launch, on Wednesday, the Ministry of Transport.
Minister Aleš's office is of the opinion that it will discourage drivers of dangerous behaviour at the wheel.
This campaign costing 150 million will appear on television, radio, cinema, internet, but also on tracts.
It should discourage drivers from driving fast and driving alcohol.
But also remind them to take the belt before starting.
She wants to touch the conscience of young drivers, motorists, pedestrians, and not forget professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Especially personal stories that will attack emotions.
This is also evidenced by the "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign:
You don’t think about paying!
The phrase "Don't Think" is inscribed in capital letters on the registration plate.
Then, in a bloodflake, there's the phrase "Your Pay".
Which must symbolize that one can pay from life a moment of attention.
The spots will "hate" the spectators until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where images can be seen with dramatic images of accident victims.
It is estimated that this will result in a decrease in the incidence of accidents and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG Agency.
The strategy of sugar and whipping against drivers
"What works with drivers is the system of sugar and whipping.
For them, sugar is represented, for example, by gaining time, when they grill a red fire.
The whip is the threat of a fine or an accident.
The risks must be reminded to the drivers," said Martin Kořán, the transportation psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
That is why we need information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative advertisements, says the psychologist.
The signs indicating the danger to drivers are, in his view, already less effective.
"When a static panel that warns against a danger is installed, it will probably quickly merge with the environment and drivers will no longer notice it," Kořán said.
Olmert would make peace in exchange for almost all occupied territories
Mr. Ehud Olmert, President of the Israeli Interim Government, spoke in favour of the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He made this statement in an interview published Monday by the daily Yedioth Ahronoth.
"We have to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to make almost all the territories (occupied), even all," said Olmert daily.
"We will keep a certain percentage of the territory, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage (of Israeli territory), since otherwise peace will not take place," he added.
He admitted that the possible return would include East Jerusalem.
"He who desires security in Jerusalem, and above all does not want tractors and bulldozers to crush his feet, as this has happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem," Olmert noted, alluding to the two attacks in the city in July, in which several people were killed and dozens of wounded people.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mount, the sacred and historical places" within the Old City.
"He who wishes to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will be forced to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won't work," he pointed out later.
Retreat of the heights of the Golan
Olmert also spoke in favour of Israel's retreat from Golan's heights, which he felt was an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
However, this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose to conclude peace with Syria solely on the basis of a retreat from the Golan," he said.
"The Syrians know very well what they will have to give up to get the Golan.
They will have to renounce their current relations with Iran; they will have to renounce their relationship with Hezbollah (Shiite Movement); they will have to give up their constant support for Hamas (Shiite Movement), Al-Kaida (Terrorist Network), as well as the Jihad (Holy War) in Iraq," said the Prime Minister.
Questions that arise after the accident: Are Stewards in the car illegal?
The law ignores them; walking in a long car is forbidden
In the context of the tragic accident of the bus of the Student Agency near Padua, Italy, the question arises whether drivers and passengers can travel on the journey inside the bus.
"If the law was to be strictly and formally respected, the activity of a steward is contrary to the road traffic law," said the spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in question, during which a 22-year-old guest died, was apparently caused by the driver of a truck that crossed the road to the bus.
The girl was at this moment unfortunately sitting next to the driver, on the most dangerous seat of the vehicle, although she had two other seats at her disposal.
However, the coach may have an accident, or even severely slow down, also when the steward serves coffee or distributes newspapers.
What matters is whether the coach is on the basis of its technical sheet equipped with standing places or not.
If this standing-place equipment is not approved, passengers must remain seated.
The long distance buses Student Agency do not have standing seats; this was confirmed at Aktuálně.cz by the director of Radim Jančura.
"This is a question we have dealt with with with the ministry and, at first, it prohibits any travel of passengers.
Then they canceled it and we got that passengers can go to the toilet during the journey provided they have their own seat," he revealed his position.
The law ignores Steward
"There is no uniform legal interpretation of Steward's role - no legal prescription takes care of this role.
On the other hand, there is no legal requirement to prohibit the carrier from offering services.
The Road Transport Act knows only the term of vehicle receiver; it does not define its rights and duties," adds Hanzelka, with more ambiguity.
Josef Pokorný, the director of the road vehicle traffic department, believes, on the contrary, that the law deals sufficiently with the problem.
"It all depends on the fact that the bus has in its approval permission to offer standing seats.
It's all in there," he says.
Buses are divided into urban areas, where there are standing spaces and a maximum limited speed, interurban with standing spaces and a higher allowed speed and without standing long-distance buses with the highest allowed speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
As on the plane, says an expert
Jaroslav Hořín, expert at BESIP (safe road traffic) safely in transport, does not see the shift of on-board stewardess as a major problem.
"During regular traffic, there is no danger; the situation can be compared to that of service in aircraft.
Nor is it safe when there will be turbulence and the hostess of the air can shape its head."
"But in the event that the bus would have stopped abruptly, the laws of physics would of course have been valid.
In the same way as on an urban bus or on a tram.
The carrier must manage the security of the drivers by internal requirements," he said and also felt that from the point of view of the law, the problem was not solved.
Jančura is ready to delete these services
Student Agency is the only bus carrier to offer Stewards services.
He hired two hundred of them.
Even after this accident, the director does not regard his trade as a risky trade.
"However, as soon as I have the impression that this is a risky job, I will remove it.
Passengers can receive their coffee and newspaper on board.
It would also reduce the costs," he said.
The concern for safety is the reason given by the director of Asiana Alexei Litvine, who, in comparison with SA, ensures a very small number of lines in his vehicles.
"We have no hostesses, we have opposed them from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end with a fatal accident," he said, a year ago, at Týden.cz.
An immense tragedy has arrived
A young hostess of the Plzeň region, who had been working for the society for two years, died during the accident on the Naples line.
A Slovenian truck probably left the emergency stop band without using a blinker and he blocked the road on the bus.
The driver tried to avoid it by means of a sudden manoeuvre, but he flaunted it on his right side.
Jančura refuses to sell the two seats reserved for the steward's rest.
"In the case of long lines, it is not possible to reserve these places, they are blocked."
The company intends to file a complaint against the driver of the truck.
For the compensation of the girl's family, the agency will not wait for the judgment of the court, but with respect to the financial compensation, it will also count on the guilty person.
An amendment to the law?
Not in sight
An amendment to the Act, which has been being developed for more than a year by a group of 30 experts from the Ministry of Transport, could provide details on the travel of bus drivers on board the bus.
"But it did not lead to any conclusion on that point.
In fact, she does not care too much about buses, but rather about the point system, at the maximum speed on the highway and the use of the mobile to the steering wheel," said expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of drivers as something that would fundamentally endanger the safety of passengers," concludes the spokesman Hanzelka, stating that the control of bus safety is under the authority of the police and the Office for Safety at Work.
The hopes of the Düsseldorfois are based on Frankfurt.
The main words were not missing in the letter addressed to the household employees by the WestLB Steering Committee.
By a union of the financial institutions of Düsseldorf with the Deka-Bank of Frankfurt, "the central financial market institution of the Sparkasse financial group" could form, according to the letter made public Monday.
WestLB would bring a "competent block" coupled with sustainable productivity in such a case.
All in all, such a relationship could be a turning point for other concentrations in the Länder banking sector.
This is what it looks like when a steering committee tries to demonstrate its capacity for action in difficult times.
Because the WestLB, wounded, is still under high pressure.
It is not only the European Commission, but also the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority, which has only recently made it clear to the government of the North Rhine-Westphalia that time was counted in the search for a future solution.
However, it has been a question for some time already - also on the side of Frankfurt - of a relationship of some form between the Deka bank, which knows the Sparkasse customers from their investment funds, and the WestLB.
The head of the Deta-Bank Franz Waas made it clear during the presentation of the figures for the late August semester that he saw no meaning in the merger of the House of Mainzer Landstrasse with a Bank of Land, whether the Helaba or the WestLB.
However, the Deka Board of Directors, of which every half is supported and by the Länder banks and savings banks, has assigned the Steering Committee to conduct talks with WestLB for common commercial activities.
It could then be the flow of the financial market, or parts thereof.
The talks just started, however, are said in the financial place.
This is not the first time that the Deta-Bank, with its 3000 employees, counts for one of the largest employers in Frankfurt's financial position, comes to play about consolidating the savings fund sector.
In 2003, it was believed for a time that the Deta-Bank could merge with the Bank of Rhineland Palatinat and Halbab.
But nothing came out of this landline bouquet.
The plans had hardly been made public that the Hesse Land Government had spoken out against Hellaba's participation in them.
Later, the other two houses did not join either.
The Land Bank of Rhineland Palatinate was linked to the Land Bank of Bade-Wuttenberg in Stuttgart.
But there have always been new talks about the regrouping of the Deka-Bank with banks in Länder.
Last but not least, Günther Merl, chairman of the Hellaba Steering Committee, spoke out against any commercial merger strategy with his bank.
Apart from this, the feeling appears to be widespread that the grouping of different public sector institutions is particularly urgent.
Now that the election to the Parliament of the Land of Bavaria has passed, a BayernLB union with the Bank of the Land of Bade-Wuttenberg could take place first.
For Helaba, this is not particularly good news.
If the pressure that forces new mergers should increase, potential partners will gradually escape it.
In the South, she would now be a junior partner, although she had so far been more resistant to the crisis than the banks of Munich and Stuttgart.
The group of Hesse-Thuringe savings and transfers, which owns 85 percent of Helaba's capital, pulled a lock at the beginning of the year on any union with the WestLB.
It'd keep the NordLB stiff.
However, such geo-strategic reflections reflect only one facet.
Another facet raises the question of how the different commercial models of each of these banks can be expanded.
In June, Merl stated that the decisive question, namely, through which commercial model, the future capacity of Länder banks should be ensured, had not so far been resolved by the German caisses de savings and transfers group.
In the end, a WestLb detachment could take place, detachment that is obviously not desired here.
This is also the subject of the letter from the Steering Committee in place: in any event, a 'global solution' would be included for the establishment.
How all this will be put in the same basket with the union of certain entities with the Deta-Bank still remains to be seen.
The second weekend of the beer festival is also known as the Italian weekend.
For Elena, this is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena accompanies him as a girlfriend, and so nothing is the same, he says.
Behind them, close to a five-liter bottle of beer from the Kaiser brand, there is a well-built barbu that shows about 200 visitors to the beer festival what deep sounds his dog can produce.
Elena taps Luca first, then kisses her.
From Bologna, they came to Verona.
From there, from the bus station near the Puerta nouveau station, four buses take departure this evening at 23h45, `destination Monaco, feast of the beer', arrived at 6h30.
Three buses are reserved primarily for Italians, on one of the buses travelling exclusively Brazilians.
In one corner of the parking lot, the South Americans sing bears and already next to their flag, they already celebrated last night.
And also noisy, Marco Guarda explains, it's not for the Italians.
The buses belong to Marco, which wears a long coat lined with false fur and glasses with large silver mounts.
For five years, they've been going to the beer party, already three turns nothing but this year.
They go out at night, stay the day at the party, and go home at 10:30.
Spending the night would involve unnecessary expenses, explains Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome pot with a Kaiser beer, brewed in accordance with the Bavarian purity law, health insurance and a German-speaking group manager Marco took a language course in Frankfurt.
And already the buses ride in the night on the Highway direction `Brenner'.
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly, everything gets calm on the bus, travelers sleep.
That's better, they'll still need their strength.
Breaks will be made in Bressanone, and Holzkirchen, while a large number of other buses with Italian registration plates are once again taking a break just before Munich, on Highway 8.
When in the early morning, Marco's group finally arrives at six thirty hours as planned on the parking lot near Thérèse Square, almost 50 other buses from all over Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others gather together, Marco holds a final speech, explains the attack plan.
First of all, it's hairy from the little yellow cap.
From this is written on the left `Beer Day', in Gothic, and next to the internet address of the travel agency of Marco `conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: `When the doors of the beer cane open, we run', shout Marco in the morning.
Run!' Run and book the seats at the bottom of the tent.
`Not in front, if not blocked, and not all yellow hats on the same benches, you must distribute them into the room!'
The chop, create Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget to tell her!
`Show the security officers that we behave well!
As soon as you leave your seats, they're gone!'
Third: `To-night, to be back here ten and a half hours!'
And that's it, it went to the beer party.
On the road, someone new from the yellow jackets to the trees to find the path, the panels and even an electoral poster of a large Bavarian popular party.
We need to be ready for our return.
This is the second weekend of the beer festival, known as the Italian 'week-ends'.
There are no precise figures; we are talking about 50,000 who walk across the Alps and collapse into the beer kiosk, 10 percent of the visitors would have come from Italy this weekend.
The police are reinforced by seven police officers from South Tyrol, by Italian volunteer rescuers who support the Bavarian red cross, which carries out a statistics on the countries where Italians occupy the first place in front of the British (60 interventions) and Austrians (about 80) with almost 200 medical interventions.
The one that is especially appreciated by the Italians is the tent of the Hofbräu brewery.
Insomnia Nights for Hypo Real Estate Shareholders
The German banking system was relatively stable, the Federal Minister of Finance only a few weeks ago insisted.
What a chance the politician was using the word `relatively' and that the German banking sector would not be spared by crisis movements.
This has indeed happened this weekend.
The capital of the Bavarian Real Estate Real Estate (HRE), next to the DAX, obtains a one-billion credit from a German bank consortium to protect itself from market turbulence.
A person in the confidence of the situation told Reuters Monday that the aid credits are issued up to EUR 35 billion.
The Royal Estate Hypo should now pay interest on the fraction to which it would thus be entitled.
Money comes from both private and public banks.
In the background, it is the Depfa-daughter who supports the losses.
According to a newspaper article, the state finance had been refinanced in the short term for long-term projects for which it had borrowed money - which has been no longer possible since mistrust of markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's liquidity reserve had been reduced from 95 per cent to 2.37 million euros, and the equity rate also had a slight decrease of 1.6 to 1.45 per cent.
The current and net profits from financial transactions were, compared to the same period of the previous year, falling to zero, the profits from the allocation of specific receivables and securities and the termination of provisions in credit operations had fallen from more than 70 per cent to 5 million euros.
And it is only thanks to the significant profits derived from the reimbursement of the downstream accounting costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa Group, as well as from the reimbursement of interest according to the book of fiscal procedures and commercial purchases for Konzern's businesses that the earnings deficit of about 16 percent has been moderated.
After its privatization in 1990, the former state finance had initially been poorly speculated on industrial real estate credits, which had then been affiliated to the Aareal Bank.
Because conventional state funding was not profitable enough, the Depfa then engaged more intensively in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint projects between private and state investors (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and internationally diversified.
On the value of the daughter-society, the Hypo Real Estate must be amortised which should have on the calculation of the gains and losses of the group an essential material effect that remains quite unclear.
The fact is, the dividends were amputated.
Already for 2007, they had been truncated to two thirds.
The Hypo Real Estate is, since the acquisition of Depfa, a highly important investor of state and infrastructure.
It is stronger than other institutions dependent on refinancing in the interbank market, since it does not own any customer deposits.
With the bankruptcy of the investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the allocation of credits between banks was again considerably tari, the banks having accumulated their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs a part annually - approximately EUR 50 Milliards - of all the Depfa credits of a short-term means of refinancing.
According to a statement by the Hypo Real Estate, the need for the group's funding is covered with medium-term credit and the protected enterprise from the influence of international financial markets largely out of working condition at present.
Other sources say that refinancing will be provided through the funds until the end of 2009.
On the other hand, HRE Chairman Georg Funke explained that the Hypo Real Estate Group should no longer resort to medium-term financial markets.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Establishment for the Monitoring of Financial Services (Bafin) are based on the principle that the ability of the Hypo Real Group on the market is now assured.
The shareholders and creditors of the bank only have to hope for it.
However, in view of the dynamics and impermissibility of the crisis, there is no certainty.
It is not inconceivable that funding should not be used in its entirety.
But the opposite can no longer be ruled out.
Following the fact that the bank is, according to the latest reports, still at the gates of insolvency on Sunday at the end of the evening, this rescue for the least provisional will not be able to reassure the spirits either.
The course of the action ran from 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
The courses of obligations, on the other hand, are particularly well carried out.
While first-in-chief debt has barely moved, second-rate loans are slowing down.
The most affected are the investment funds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and, of course, those that have a life span beyond 2009.
The obligations of the bank Hippo Real Estate had previously appeared to be an alternative speculation placement, now their value must be considered dependent on the stability of the international banking system after the net hardening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institution itself which brought the crisis into the establishment by the acquisition of the Depfa bank.
While emission institutes, governments and less-affected commercial banks are still ready to support the system, a resupply over time can be assumed.
Or it will happen what no one would dare to expect at the moment - that the financial crisis can be overcome in the next 15 months.
But in the face of the renewed sounds of partial nationalization, the probability that approaching security has now become a mere grounded hope.
This should allow for sleepless nights primarily for long-term creditors to decide whether to separate themselves from their commitments.
Short-term investors can always use what they have drawn on to represent a deferral of losses for the next few years on the next income tax of automatically collected stock profits.
Sylvana and the secrets of the box in Bento
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16 years old, has to show up for the first day at High School in Tachibana, the girls start to laugh: the German is so "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows this word thanks to the Mangas - in her new trading log, she talks about Japan.
"The first day of class in Japan.
That's what I was excited about.
I was already scared to go to school.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and take the 40-minute train to High School in Tachibana.
I had to find my own way, fortunately I didn't lose.
The beginning of the courses does not appear to be as strict as our home in Lower Saxony.
Students appear after each other from eight hours, until nine hours minus twenty, a table tour begins with the professor, the "home room".
But before the course started, it was up to me to introduce myself.
I'm not like to talk in front of people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I had not yet the uniform of the school, I put on an old skirt from my host mother, as well as a shirt, blue-sleeved socks and black leather shoes.
In this outfit, I presented myself before the desk, and tried to pronounce everything correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - My name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and my birthday is in a week.
At that time, I was very happy to have started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class all made low masses, made laughs and made signs, and I constantly heard the word "Kawaii".
I already knew him because of my sleeves.
It belongs to the vocabulary essential to the survival of Japanese adolescents and means "mignon, chou".
Then I quickly slipped instead of me.
The girl next to me gave me a big ironic smile, she thought it was an honor that the corresponding woman had to sit next to her.
The rest of the time was quite quiet, but when the gong resonated, I was tested in the rules.
Everyone was talking to better people, laughing and asking me a lot of questions - in this case, it's hard enough to understand English Japanese.
During the pause, they all left their Bento.
My foster mother had also done this kind of Lunchbox to me - that's really something other than the miserable Germans.
I had rice with aromatic herbs, small sausages, a cucumber salad and algae, fruit and a kind of meat surrounded by Tofu.
Most of the time, I have no idea what I'm eating right here in Japan.
Things have a strange appearance and a completely new taste.
What's certain is that everything is really good.
All right, except maybe we'll get some fresh plums, Brrrr.
Bentos are not just lunches in Japanese schools.
Sometimes a girl offers a boy a Bento that she has prepared herself, and then is prepared especially carefully - in the hope of getting to know the boy a little better during the break.
I read that in my sleeves.
I'm curious to know if I could watch it here too.
"Why especially Japan?" asked my friends when I told them that I wanted to spend a year at school in Tokyo.
Then I always said:
"Because it fascinates me, what"
In the end, reading mangos is what I've been preferring for years.
And in order to better understand the mangoes and culture that is there, at some point, I also started learning Japanese.
For me, it was really clear that I had to travel there one day.
Because I also have a weak one for traditions, customs and customs.
And here, they're given a lot of importance.
On the one hand, Japan is the country of the most recent technologies and trends - on the other, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And since everything is so well organized, I've never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen."
Rats also have feelings
A rat or a cockroach escapes in the face of danger, does that mean he feels too afraid?
The neurophysicist Joseph LeDoux is convinced of this: many animals also have sensations.
But how can we verify that he feels the same way when he behaves in the same way as we do?
In the online magazine "Edge", contributions have been published for several years by famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series of articles of the answers to the question "What do you think is true without having proof?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else until now being able to prove it just as we cannot prove that other human beings have a consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope that all human brains present the same configuration.
As soon as we turn to other species and deal with the questions of feeling or in general consciousness, we will enter into areas that are difficult to practice because the Hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: it makes death, escapes or attacks.
Human beings behave in the same way, which is why some scientists deduct a comparable subjective life.
However, I don't believe in it.
Two aspects of the brain structure make the transposition of our subjective life to that of animals difficult.
One aspect is that the circuits associated almost always with human consciousness include the prefrontal lateral cortex (because of its participation in short-term memory and leadership and enforcement functions).
This vast region is much more developed in humans than in other primates and appears to be entirely absent in other beings.
So at least for these aspects of our consciousness that depend on the Prefrontal Cortex, including the awareness of who we are, and the ability to predict and decide, it is reasonable to assume that the human being differs even from the other primates.
Another significant characteristic could be the linguistic nature of man: a large part of his existence being related to language, which often means that his consciousness depends on him.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if conscience did not depend on language, it would certainly influence it, so that animal consciousness, whatever the way it is produced, would probably differ much from most of our consciences.
This is why it is also difficult to determine what the consciousness of other animals may look like.
If this, internal and subjective, does not allow itself to be measured or, as a result of this particular Hardware, to analyze based on our own experience, then its observation poses serious problems.
Most of my developments refer to the content of the conscious life, but there is another aspect of the consciousness that should be more readily accessible scientifically.
Animal consciousness processes could be examined without taking into account their content, and that is exactly what happened in studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially with the example of visualization.
But in this approach followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, one focuses more on the nerve correlations of consciousness than on causal mechanisms: both can be identical or not.
Curiously, this approach also highlights the importance of the Prefrontal Cortex in achieving visualization.
But what happens then to emotions?
I conclude that an emotional system such as fear is activated in a conscious brain of its own activity.
What we design as "poor" is therefore the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its suites, such as the reactions of the body) takes hold of the vivid memory.
Thus observed, emotions are closely related to the regions of the cortex that characterise primates and especially man.
Subtle degrees of feeling, associated with our volatile nature, emerge, because we can, with the help of words and grammar, differentiate and categorize states to imput them to others than ourselves.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that sensations from primitive activities are born in the regions of the body sensation of the Cortex and the brain stem, as well as Jaak Pankseep, which focuses more on the brain trunk.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it could fully participate in transversal sensations in any kind.
From a purely theoretical point of view, I cannot contradict it, but I believe it is unevident.
Pankseep argues that what appears as fear among men and rats is likely to be as felt in both cases: how can we verify whether rats and men feel the same way when they behave in a similar way?
A cockroache escapes in the face of danger, but if he feels afraid?
In my view, similar behaviours are not sufficient to prove identical experiences.
Of course, the nerve comparison helps: rats and men have similar brain trunks, but cockroaches do not even have a brain.
But is the brain stem the origin of the sensations?
And even if we could prove this to the human: how can we prove it to the rats?
I believe that rats and other mammals, perhaps even cockroaches (who knows?) have feelings.
But I wouldn't know how to prove it.
And because their sensations are likely to differ completely from ours (since human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore emotional behavior than the emotional sensations of rats.
In all cases, progress is nervous, as the same is true of rats and humans.
As I do not explore the language and consciousness of rats, nor the sensations, I do not know if they exist.
We could view this as short-term, but I prefer to move forward rather than constantly forming against a wall.
I am indeed a pragmatic emotion.
Platini, president of UEFA: a grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik explained that preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government considers the UEFA decision in Bordeaux to be evidence of trust in Ukraine and its ability to organize, in collaboration with Poland, the European championships," Wasjunik announced.
"But it's not an amnesty for our country.
The work just started, and there is still a lot to do in both countries."
In the calendar of the construction or destruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, the two guests run after the delays.
The number of stadiums for the European Championship could eventually be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must work at maximum speed," said the President of the Ukrainian League Grigorij Surkis.
"UEFA has constantly kept an eye on us."
An even more radical measure was decided in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish football league PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee after many scandals and replaced by Robert Zawlocki, independent administrator.
The commission met at the request of the Minister of Sports Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There would be "a real danger that the PZPN would not be able to act in the rules," Drzewiecki said of the Polish press agency PAP.
"We assured the President of UEFA in a letter that the preparations for the 2012 European Championship would not suffer."
Several members of the First Division League were already convicted in the previous season for the manipulation of mandatory relegation; in the end, the beginning of the League even took off at the last minute.
Dennis Quaid indignified counter-attack
She wanted to make a promotion for a new film, talked about her private life in an interview - and now has trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan lifted the veil on her former adult Dennis Quaid.
He ecumenical - and counter-attack.
A late Rose War for former couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors are going into a miserable battle - in sight and in the south of everyone.
Last week, Meg Ryan spoke in an interview with the American InStyle newspaper about the causes of the marriage failure: "Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, and it was very painful."
She would have become aware of the extent of deception only after the divorce.
The motive of this striptease of thought lies in Ryan's press relations for his new film "The Women" - is told the story of an adult.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his qualification as unfaithful husband clearly fell: it would be "Monstrueux", said this in the "New York Daily News", 54 years old, that "Meg re-remote the story of our relationship and manipulate".
It would also be "regretable", that "the pain and disturbances that a divorce involves for each child are revived in public" for their 16-year-old common son Jack."
As Ryan lives alone since the divorce, Quaid remarried and soon becomes the father of twins.
Thus was his answer to the gryphon: "In any case, my life goes on.
I feel happy to have a wonderful family that works best."
Prices of plane tickets and hotels fall
In the first half of 2008, flights and hotel nights were cheaper than the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would even be reduced to 50 per cent.
The flights and hotel nights would have become advantageous again - this is the result of a study by the American Express Financial Service and Travel Provider.
The company analysed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and established, after an increase in prices in the first quarter, a sharp decrease in profits in the second quarter.
After prices on the hotel market have increased for years, hotel nights have already been reduced in many places.
From January to March prices increased in 41 of the 48 European cities examined by an average of 6.9 per cent compared with 2007 in 41 of the 48 European cities examined.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than the previous year.
The trend was mostly clear in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay from 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
The causes of all this would be for American Express in the low dollar class that led to "a desire for downward travel of American tourists".
Financial places such as Frankfurt or London would also be more affected by the decline in hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Swedish city, hotel prices are maintained with an increase of 26.3 percent, the record in Europe.
Also in terms of flight prices, the trend was rising in the first quarter:
As a result of the increase in the price of kerosene, passengers in economic class have to pay on average 7.1 per cent more than in 2007, long-run flights, which are very fuel consumers, have even increased to 29.2 per cent.
From April to June, the prices of tickets in economic class fell by an average of 12.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter, in business class and in first class, however, price variations were much less pronounced.
In Germany prices have fallen even more sharply than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices increased by 11.9 per cent, in the second quarter, they fell by 23.6 per cent.
German domestic flights were even divided by two according to this study.
The reasons for this fall in prices would, on the one hand, be slow economic growth, explains the firm.
The application came from the ground in many segments of the air travel market.
On the other hand, there would be an increased pressure on competition from the Open Chile Treaty, which liberalises air traffic between the United States and Europe.
Signs of the tense situation are the abolition by airlines of non-rentable journeys, as well as the high number of airlines that would have filed the balance sheet during the first half of 2008 - they were 24 companies only in Europe.
HSV bat Gladbach 1:0
With a simple goal and methods, the SV Hamburg becomes the top of the ranking.
In Borussia, Luhukay has still not been able to find a functional eleven.
By Kristoffer Klein. Enlarge. Disaster landing for international player Marko Marin.
Gladbach's player was only late in the game and his shot was down against the frame of the goal.
His message was precisely formulated, he was persuasively out of his lips.
He simply knew he was right.
"We need this second goal", sifla Hermann Rieger in the hall of the lockers of the Hamburg arena.
There wasn't much going on in the locker rooms, the half-time was over, and most of them took their place.
Rieger has been HSV's physiotherapist for almost three decades, enjoying a great reputation as former protagonists.
And that's why his application was received in strategic places.
The assistant coach Cornelius Jol acquiesced and lifted the thumb to approve.
Cornelius is the brother of the head coach of Hamburg Martin Jol.
With orders it seems to have been similar: and it jumps with this second goal!
The practice has failed.
"Everything wasn't very nice to see today," Marcel Jansen later confessed.
Bastian Reinhard would have "sustained also to be more relaxed".
This 1:0 (1:0 in mid-time), the Hamburg team owes it to a head hit by Mladen Petric (at 11th minute); and the fact that the very weak Gladbach players could not hurt the low players in Hamburg.
"It was a dirty victory," said Marin Jol.
Hamburg's SV will celebrate its 121s this Monday.
By Saturday afternoon, the supporters celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the provisional ranking tables on the giant screen that indicated their club as the first of the class.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to go back," said Marcell Jansen.
It is doubtful that the intermediate result of the table reflects more the unpredictable nature of the First League than the domination of its HSV.
The team with its late arrivals – Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goalkeeper Petric, as well as Jansen debauched from the FC Bayern – is certainly slowly formed, but it does not shine yet.
"We need more charm and more dribble," Jol demanded.
After the failure of the vote
On Wall Street, fear circulates.
The first news of the failure of the rescue plan has caused the Dow Jones to fall temporarily by 700 points.
It was the biggest loss of points in the space of a day of all history.
Later, the Dow Jones got a little caught up.
About 8:30 p.m., the world's largest stock exchange index cost 10,579 points with a drop of much five percent.
The Nasdaq technology grant index was at 1548 points with a drop of more than seven points.
The most losers of the Dow Jones were at that time American Express that lost almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12 percent.
No title could report profits anymore.
Bank Goldman Sachs' shares declined by almost 10 percent.
Just a few days ago, the great investor Warren Buffet joined the company.
As part of the rescue plan, the means must be mobilized for the purchase of what is called spoiled mortgage paper.
However, the amount must not be paid at once, but gradually.
On the other hand, the State should retrieve options on the actions of the financial society that can be exchanged in line with the course's evolution in order to reduce its burden on the Public Treasury.
The Courses of Aspired Actions in the Turbillon in Europe and the United States
The billions of aid for banks in Europe and the United States do not pay for investor concerns.
The course of the action of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate collapses and pulls the Dax into the background.
The U.S. index of Dow Jones collapses despite the rescue of the state's financial market.
The German index (Dax) has led to a profound deficit in the courses of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank.
The share of the Bavarian Real Estate Financial has lost three-quarters of its value at the moment despite the rescue operation of the federal government and private banks, the Commerzbank has incurred a decrease of more than 20 percent.
The Dax clearly slipped below the important psychological bar of the 6,000 points and was at 5,839 points with a deficit of 3.7 percent.
Around the world, stock markets have fallen on their knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors feared that the US government's $700 billion heavy rescue plan could not be sufficient to restart financial markets.
The Dow Jones at 10,809,25 points lost in the first opening hour 334 points or 3.3 percent.
The House of Representatives of the United States intended to vote on the bailout, and the vote in the Senate was expected to follow on October 1.
The other European scholarships also had one direction: in London, the FTSE 100 index claimed a fall for the moment of 3.2 percent, CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.

Dark matter influences the flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has left researchers in perplexity: dark matter influences the speed of space probes during what is called gravitational support maneuvers.
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity is not completely correct.
For almost 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" has flown into space.
As fuel pipelines are soon frozen, cryogenous death threatens it.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has been the cause of disarray among researchers - the anomaly of gravitational support.
Gravitational support is a manoeuvre of space probes, by which they gain additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example the Earth.
So the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The American-European research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick, as did the Ulysses solar probe.
This is what has surprised researchers for years: flying objects do not always behave to 100 percent of the way they are expected according to the venerable laws of gravity.
What is more, irregularities appear at the speed level.
The probes become unexpectedly faster or slower.
Until now, physicists could not explain this effect.
They baptized him the anomaly of gravitational support.
Some experts feared that the theory of the general relativity of Albert Einstein, which describes the attraction force of the matter because of the curvature of space, might not be entirely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study always thinks it's hard to do that Einstein didn't cheat and tries to explain the anomaly of gravitational support using what is called the black matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
"The black matter could be responsible for this anomaly, which is also located near the Earth," he wrote.
Space researchers have only known the existence of black matter for about ten years.
It apparently emanates from it an attraction force whose effect is observable on other celestial bodies.
On the other hand, it is completely invisible, i.e. it does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, particularly no visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, black matter would still represent a good fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Tourists taken from Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their captors, tourists kidnapped in Egypt should be released and the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs confirmed it.
The Sudanese captors had demanded a ransom of several million euros.
During the shooting before release, six hostages were reportedly killed.
In southern Egypt, five Germans were abducted.
The ransom negotiations would already be initiated.
The Germans are constantly in the kidnappers collimator.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are visibly free.
This has been reported in concert by the Egyptian state television, the Arab television channel Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
The Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the Italian television channel Sky TG 24, "Our fellow citizens and other hostages have been released.
We're checking their health," said Frattini.
The five Germans, the five Italians and Romanians as well as their eight Egyptian escorts are doing well and safe, announced Egypt's national television.
The 19 participants in the desert tour should already be on their way to Cairo.
The circumstances surrounding a shooting prior to the release of the hostages remain unclear: thus, the kidnappers would have been close to putting an end to the kidnapping, according to the statements of an Egyptian security officer, before the Sudanese army kills six of the kidnappers without shouting the station.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with a ransom," said the agent.
There was nothing left to collect the hostages," when suddenly, "this surprise" happened.
On Sunday, six of the raptors in the border area between the Sudan, Chad and Egypt had been killed by Sudanese soldiers, and two of them had been arrested.
The hostage takers had demanded from Germany a ransom of €6 million; the money had to be delivered by the German woman of one of the hostages.
The daily "El Masri El Jom" stated that, according to a German mediator, the release of hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the article, the raptors wanted to release women's hostages after ransom payment.
The men had to be held back until the rappers found a safe road to escape.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to comment on this account.
Abuse of a father-in-law who leads suicide.
A court was informed that years of abuse by her father-in-law led a woman to commit suicide.
Michael Trerise, 57 years old, of Stithians, in the Cornwalls, was imprisoned for six years after having admitted eight counts for indecent evidence.
Truro's High Court reported that he regularly linked his daughter-in-law, Stéphanie Randle, during his childhood, from 5 to 7 years old.
Trerise wrote in a letter of confession: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court was informed that Ms. Randle, aged 34, committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007.
As a child when she lived in Coventry, Trerise had tied her up and taped her before forcing her into sexual activity, while her mother worked in the pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and returned to live in the Cornwalls.
Her daughter-in-law went to Plymouth.
But the court was informed that Miss Randle, a volunteer assistant to National Trust, was haunted by the abuses that had been inflicted on her twice a week.
The Attorney General, Ramsey Quaife told the court that friends had reported that Miss Randle, who was a good surfer and a cyclist, had seemed "emotionally dead" since 2006, and "he had lost all hope for life."
In April 2007, his real father, Terrance Randle, found him dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
We think she killed herself by suffocating with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle faced the beautiful father of his daughter who had also written a letter of confession, which ended up saying, "I attached him and the bandeis regularly."
"I didn't sexually abuse her.
"I feel responsible for his death."
Justice Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "You are really weird as a fetishist, your victim must have been terrified, especially at the age of seven.
"This unpleasant saga ended with the victim's suicide.
And even more surprising, it is the fact that if she had not done this gesture, her story would certainly never have ended in court."
He added: "In particular, as described by his father and mother, the effects of your crime have been committed for years on Stéphanie.
"Without these, she would probably be a happy, promising, successful young woman today."
Condemnation for the loss of official data.
The Cabinet officer who had forgotten top secret documents in June on a train will be sentenced by the Office of Secrets Act to the BBC.
The man in the Ministry of Defence was on his way when he forgot two highly classified documents, on a train in the direction of Waterloo.
The documents were passed into the hands of the BBC before being delivered to the police.
This is the least serious conviction of this act, without any insinuation of criminal intent.
BBC correspondent Frank Gardner said that this episode had a lot of Whitehall people.
"They would have thought that this case would have remained between the walls of the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet," he said.
The employee who cannot be appointed is charged with a violation of section 8.1 of the act, i.e. the clause dealing with the safeguard of information.
.The Crown Prosecution Service suggested that the ministerial officer be placed under the supervision of the Metropolitan Police, given the very sensitive nature of his work related to the Associate Committee on Secret Services
His lost documents contained an appreciation of Al-Qaeda as well as the resources of the security forces in Iraq.
He was informed of the decision Monday morning and was then transported from his home to a secret place.
Building companies in front of the B&B invoice.
British construction companies may have to pay an invoice of over £80 million to cover the rescue of Bradford & Bingley Bank.
The Government provided £14 billion to protect the deposits of the 2.6 million Bradford & Bingleys savings.
The interest of this loan will be paid by all companies that collect savings, including 59 construction companies.
The Director General of Building Companies Association (BSA), Adrian Coles stated that it is "irritating" to know that companies and their members will have to pay the broken pots...
The £14 billion loan will be repaid when the Bradford & Bingleys mortgages are released.
But the interests that are going to increase at the same time will be debited each year to the 700 financial companies that collect deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 companies in the building are included in this list.
It's annoying to see that institutions that have acted prudently... now have to pay some of the bills from institutions that were much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It is stated that each company must pay a proportional amount to the deposits it holds, and that intermediate companies must pay about 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that the interest in the loan will be £450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find £81 million to settle the interests of the first year.
Adrian Coles, Director General of the Commercial Committee of Building Companies, told the BBC that this decision seemed unfair to him.
It is "irritating" to see that institutions that have acted prudently during the recovery of the real estate market must now pay for the much less prudent institutions.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since 1945, the date of the first years.
"We need to look at all aspects of this case over the next few weeks, to assess the options to be adopted in order to prevent building companies and their members from paying this paid bill," said Cole.
Interests for 2009 cover seven months, from the end of September of this year to the end of March.
In 2010, the interests of the whole year will have to be paid, which could also double.
In view of the fact that the building's companies are non-shareholder organizations, their members end up paying the invoice either by higher charges or by lower interest rates for savings accounts.
Milk increases up to five pennies per litre
Jersey people have to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy announced that she was going to increase the wholesale price of her milk, from five penny a litre, from Monday.
This is the second increase in the price which follows an increase of two penny in February, and is followed by a research carried out by a consulting company.
Retailers need to decide whether they are going in turn, increase the price to consumers.
Before the February increase, Jersey's wholesale milk price had been varied for the last time, in 2002.
An ex-Pm from Bangladesh was refused bail
A court in Bangladesh rejected a motion for bail from the former PM Sheikh Hasina, which could thus be arrested on his return to the country.
His lawyers said that the court refused to grant him his bail because of his examination for extorting a businessman, 50 million Taka ($729,000.00) when she was PM.
This is one of the many charges being brought to him.
Khaleda Zia, the always rival of Sheikh Hasina, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to Bangladesh within a few weeks, but her party, the Awani League, has demanded that the interim military government of the country first give her its full freedom.
Correspondents pointed out that the terms of his release were contradictory because if he was allowed to leave the country for medical reasons, they did not see why he could not remain free when he returned to Bangladesh.
His lawyers have announced that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court rejected Sheikh Hasina's request that she does not require bail since she was allowed to go abroad for medical reasons," said counsel Rafiqueul Huq.
"We will appeal against the order of the Supreme Court"
His lawyers argued that she needed this bail to return to the country to prepare the elections in December
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return after October 17, said a former leader of the Awami Party.
She was detained last year after the military acting government assumed power, but was released in June to take care of herself abroad.
Sheikh Hasina, like Zhaleda Zia, denies the charges they face.
Concerns about the Afghan antipolio campaign.
In Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children have missed the recent polio immunization campaign, as a result of Taliban-related violence, said the United Nations.
Last week, the United Nations carried out a vaccination campaign in the six provinces.
However, it states that it is not successful in contacting children in the dangerous areas of Helmand and Kandahar, in the south.
One United Nations spokesman said that this occurred despite the Taliban's promises not to attack or obstruct thousands of nurses during vaccinations.
BSkyB loses the judicial battle of ITV
BSkyB lost its trial following the verdict of the Competition Commission, which would force it to reduce its participation in its rival ITV transmitter.
The Competition Appeal Tribunal ordered BSkyB to reduce its share of ITV by 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The commission stated that MSkyB's participation in the past had prevented competition and enabled it to unfairly influence ITV.
BSkyB purchased its shares in 2006 following an agreement in fact to prevent NTL, now known as Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Fair Trading Office reported that BSkyB's purchase of ITV shares has caused doubts about the effective independence of ITV, thus encouraging the Competition Commission to investigate
Virgin's boss, Richard Branson, a group of consumers and the regulator Ofcom were all opposed to this purchase.
BSkyB retorted that forcing her to reduce her share of ITV would not be reasonable and on the contrary it was excessive – especially since BSkyB just gave up her voting rights.
New investigation into the case of U.S. prosecutors.
U.S. Attorney General appointed a special prosecutor to verify the issue of the dismissal of nine U.S. prosecutors in 2006.
The whole came from the report of the Department of Justice Inspector General's case, which criticized the actions of certain ministerial officers.
The report was critical of the White House officers, legislators and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation is based on the theory of lawyers who claim that their dismissal is due to political causes.
The Special Prosecutor, Nora Dannehy, will now investigate whether the officers interviewed during the investigation lied to the investigators, thus obstructing justice.
"Several charges of potentially criminal conduct, unfounded, have not been fully confirmed or resolved," said Inspector General Glenn Fine, in his report.
The appointment of a special accuser capable of forcing witnesses to file was one of its greatest recommendations.
The dispute began with the resignation in December 2006 of nine U.S. prosecutors formulated by the U.S. Department of Justice.
At the time, the department had stated that prosecutors were dismissed because of poor benefits.
But then it emerged that the dismissed prosecutors were no longer criticised than their colleagues, thus encouraging some observers to award these dismissals a political connotation.
Some of the prosecutors have been accused of being close to the Republicans of Congress, while others have refused to investigate allegations of fraudulent voting against the Democrats.
U.S. prosecutors investigate and prosecute the judiciary for the government.
It is certain that they may be dismissed at any time, but cannot be dismissed for political reasons.
The head of the department of justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, ended up accused of being involved in this dismissal case, and in the end he resigned.
A number of departmental officers in the Department of Justice also resigned.
The Inspector General's report was very critical of Mr. Gonzales' role in this case, stating that he considered him "first responsible" for these dismissals, and eventually "abdicate" his leadership role," which was remarkably successful in not being involved in this case.
Other ministerial officers, including former Bush collaborator Karl Rove, were criticized for failing to cooperate during the investigation.
The Meat Loaf epic must be honored.
The Rock star Meat Loaf, must be honored at the Q Awards for its epic song Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will receive an Oscar at the London ceremony next week, said he was "honored" to get this recognition.
The nine-minute and fifty-second song was the title of the 1977 Meat Loaf album.
The award-winning evening is presented by Coldplay, with this year, a selection restricted to four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are songs that transcend things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell certainly does.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a great voice like that of Meat Loaf.
It begins with an instrumental section that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was put on the market in the United Kingdom, as a single in 1979, moving to the fifteenth place.
In addition, his album Bat Out of Hell remained nine years in English rankings, and was sold to over 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf- or Marvin Lee Aday, of his real name- has suffered from health problems in recent years, even undergoing surgery to heal his heart beat became irregular, after he collapsed on stage in 2003.
In 2007, a strong laryngite forced her to cancel concerts.
Then we found a cyst in the vocal cords.
A Sombre Street in the City, Often Forgotten, and Can Be Soon for Sale.
New York has hundreds of avenues, boulevards, streets and other parallel roads, some famous, others only functional.
And even some veteran taxis as well as long-time local residents do not know how to get to Extra Place, because they have never heard of it.
The street is located in the East Village and runs north of First Street- not to be confused with Second Street- between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide for 120 long, it looks like a dusty alley rather than an active artery.
. No signs indicate the street.
It is virtually impossible to find it on a standard atlas.
This street, however, has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the builder of recent luxury buildings on First Street.
He would like to revisit Extra Place, and create a more fluid passage to shops and shops, which should open in new buildings.
Other admirers, including long-standing neighbours, have stated that they are charmed by this shortcut simply because it remains one of the last and oldest streets of housework.
But the Department of Preservation and Real Estate Development of the city that manages the street has no interest in keeping it.
This month, at a meeting of neighborhood owners' committees, representatives of city agencies and Avalon Bay drafted a proposal authorizing the real estate manufacturer to buy the street.
But the committee prefers that the street remains in the hands of the city, and asked for a new proposal to submit next month, said Susan Stetzer, the local manager of Committee No. 3.
"There are only a few spaces left in the city, and we would like the city to retain Extra Place," she said.
"They could propose to restore and manage it, what Avalon could do, but we want to keep it public."
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that she wanted to re-enter the small street and install seats there, some would also be used by a coffee that the manufacturer would grant space to.
The proposal for this potential acquisition was made public at this month's meeting.
Michele de Milly, the spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that although society wants to exploit the street, it does not necessarily mean that it wants to be the owner.
"Avalon Bay's main interest is to relocate this abandoned journey, and make it public," she said, stressing that it was the city to suggest the sale."
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Immobilier Preservation, confirmed that the city wanted to sell the street, stressing further that the agency's mission was to develop property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left a slight historical footprint.
Some believe that Extra Place has been named since 1802, when the inheritance of the large farm of Philip Minthorne's many children was divided, leaving aside this small piece of land, which has been abandoned since.
The back entrance of the CBGB, a rock punk monument closed in 2006, reopened to Extra Place; the street is certainly more famous thanks to the cover photo of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia"
"This place was beautiful," said Danny Fields, manager of the Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976.
It was full of scrap metal, hazelnuts, barrels, posters, leaves and ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers who had already talked about the evolution towards the luxury of the East Village, opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, saying that this humble small property should remain public.
Others have proclaimed Extra Place as a true rareness - a fragment virtually identical to the city that should be set in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, who conducted a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled "Le Livre des Contestations: Un Regard Arrement Nostalgica sur Une Ville in the Process of Extinction") relates the history of the City and Extra Place, published in The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a small narrow ass-sac, dark day as at night, and delimited by the doors of a rusty iron warehouse and Persians, full of last week's newspapers flying along the cliffs."
With few exceptions, the street is always the same.
A rat shorts up at the bottom of the street, near a door that once led to CBGB, and has now become the seat of a chic clothing store.
Graffitis on the walls, a bottle of beer of 22 ounces empty, lies next to newspapers that have just been dumped.
Some passers-by said they rarely think of Extra Place, and suggested its development.
Mr. Field, on his side, said that some underestimated the attractiveness of the street in its current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "have gone out in dark, wet and disgusting places."
The Bilingual Debate: Immersion in the English Language
In this part of the Education Supervision program, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the position of candidates on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a former student member in California, and former director of the Department of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "not as Good as You Think. Why the middle classes should be able to choose their school."
Attracting the favors of Hispanic voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama's proposals on education are an interesting example.
Mr Obama's campaign points out that "African and Latino students are less likely to graduate than white students."This is a fact.
In order to combat these differences, Mr Obama's education program in particular supports among so many other subjects, "bilingual transitional education" for those who learn English.
However, the question for Obama is whether his desire to achieve bilingual education that defends language-class education other than English goes beyond his interest in eliminating differences.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles.
The students of this school are mostly Hispanic and low-income.
More than one third of students, consisting of many new arrivals, study English.
Among the students of the CM1, 100% passed the 2008 math state exam, expert level.
Likewise, almost 93% of students have passed the English-language-art exam.
This incredible success was achieved through another ingredient than that made by Mr. Obama.
Sixth Street focused on analysis, practice, constant capacity assessment and exemplary attitude.
In addition, here is an example that Mr. Obama could copy, says Linda Mikels, chief of Sixth Street, this school has introduced the English language education "full immersion".
The total immersion in English focuses on the almost constant use of English in education.
Miss Mikels, contrary to bilingual education, told me "we had a huge success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico, 12 months later, if you went without his class, you would have had no chance of identifying him."
"It works, she observes, "it works for us"
Mr. Obama should not take the example of Sixth Street Prep and replicate it in other schools composed by majority of Hispanic students learning English.
The excellent results of this school speak of themselves; but the policies on education within its party (the Associations for National Education have long supported bilingual education) and its enormous support for bilingual education, obscure the prognosis of Mr. Obama's response.
Although he is in favour of the learning of English by immigrants, Mr. Obama recently considered this issue to be insignificant, when he claims that we all must stop arguing about the English language language language language.
"On the contrary, he said, "you must make sure your child speaks Spanish."
If Mr. Obama really wants to eliminate the differences, then he should consider carefully, the educational models that work, rather than detach them or consider them insignificant.
Fleet Petroleum Net Following New World Economic Concerns
Oil prices have fallen sharply on Monday, as people fear that the rescue plan for financial markets will not succeed in bringing the economy back to life.
The final operations of crude oil fell by 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel. The New York Mercantile Exchange, at this morning's sales.
Prices have fallen from over $20 per barrel since last Monday.
In the last two weeks, the commodity markets have been shaken by the financial turmoil of Wall Street, as well as by two powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After having seen an increase of $145.29 in the barrel in July, prices fell to almost $90 in the barrel this month, before rebounding in view of the profound uncertainties in the financial markets.
This Monday, investors are again concerned with the rescue agreement, the largest in history, concluded this weekend by the leaders of Congress.
The news was mitigated by recent concerns that the crisis would be sustainable.
In the most recent episode of this financial disaster," Citygroup will purchase the banking operations of the Wachovia Corporation, said the government on Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partly nationalized the European financial conglomerate, Fortis.
Barclays Capital analysts have stated that the frenetic negotiations of this weekend, concluded with the rescue agreement, seem to have failed to bring the market back."
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for raw materials, including oil, should slow down.
"the prospector of global equity, interest rates and market exchange has become uncertain," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a letter to their investors."
"we believe that raw materials will not be able to escape this contagion.
"As far as raw materials are concerned, our most pressing concern is to understand how far the American virus would spread globally and in particular in China."
Bank analysts have reduced their expectations for the next year, given the fall in oil consumption due to the slowdown in economic growth, they are obliged to decrease by 20 per cent, oil and gas price forecasts for 2009.
The Second Time Celebration Determinant for the Improvement of Team Record.
After spending the last eight seasons, more time than anyone in the Shaun Ellis Jets uniform, the defender thought he had seen everything.
He was watching the second time, when the Jets turned 0 to 0 into an explosion.
"I've never seen anything like this," Ellis said.
The second time began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals played salt under obscure clouds.
Then the quarter back Brett Favre managed to make a pass to Laveranus Coles allowing a 12-yard touchdown, a precursor sign of one after noon during which their relationship made a leap forward.
Favre found Coles for another two more touchdowns, the first when a corner back fell and the second, 10 seconds from mid-time.
"I didn't get out of my area," Favre said about all his passes to Coles.
"he's a poor player"
"We communicate extremely well, despite what people think."
As Favre and Coles played in the catch, the defense beat Cardinals' quarterback, Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, corner back, intercepted a lost shot and struck 32 yards up to touchdown.
Eric Smith took another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker, David Bowens let the ball escape because of Warner.
In the last change, the loss of Bowens' ball might well be the most charming event
The Cardinals took control of this possession for the last 10 seconds, and then the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely made a 20 yard goal with a benefit of 34 to 0.
It was the best that the Jets could have scored in a while.
"The Jet coach, Eric Mangini, who was asked to describe this madness," said "second or third time?"
When he was told the two - the Jets have allowed to pass 21 indisputable points in the third time - Mangini said: "I can tell you that I enjoyed the second time more than the third time.
"Many points have been marked in a short time."
Gebreslassie rested, surpasses his world record.
Haile Gebrslasie, Ethiopian, again proved to be worthy of his title as the best runner in the century, after beating his own record of the world at the Berlin Marathon Sunday, becoming the first to run 26.2 miles in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a win in 2 :03:59 of an accommodating race on the plate, Gebrsellasie beat his record of 2:04:26 last year in Berlin by 27 seconds.
At 35 years of age, Gebrselasie won the 26th world record of his superb career in which he won the World Championship or the World Record for any distance, from the 1600 meters of the Marathon.
Last month, Gebrsellasia had missed Beijing's Olympic Marathon, fearing- it can be exaggerated in today's eyes- that air pollution does not increase its asthma problems.
On the contrary, he promises to run to Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions- sunny time, 48 degrees at departure, 55 at arrival- Gebrsellasia won Sunday, now an impressive average of one thousand in 4 minutes 43 seconds
The racers such as Gebrselassia and Paul Tergat, both Kenyans, converted into background runners, contributed to the reduction of the marathon record by more than two minutes in the last ten years, since 1998, when Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin at 2:06:05 .
After Sunday's victory, Gebreslasie told the reporters, had suffered cramps at the spring two weeks before, and had missed training for a week.
Clearly, rest allowed him to remain bright, but not rusty.
"I'm so happy," he told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I was there last week, and today I had doubts; but in the end, everything went for the best."
He has been reproached in Kenya, the African rival of Ethiopia- for having too much orchestrated his races, avoiding the world stars of the marathon, actually counting on the hares as if they were in a track competition, and considering world records more than the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the size of Gebrsellasia's abilities as a runner in the background.
Sunday, Gebrselassie, preceded by four Kenyans, recorded a time of 1:02:04. in my path.
Two Kenyan elite riders, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to challenge Gebrsellasia after the heads of the ranks disappeared.
At just over three miles from the arrival, Gebrselasie made his final ride to depart from Kwambai, which ended second in 05:36, improving his best personal record of five minutes.
Kamathi arrived third at 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, now a German citizen, finished a remarkable year obtaining the seventh time of 2:19:19.
Englishman Paula Radcliffe holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko surprised everyone winning the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She could not participate in the Beijing Games because of a hypothetical back injury, but promised to win in Berlin, improving her third marathon, her personal record of almost five minutes.
It runs through a skilled strategy, allowing the group of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners to take a good advantage, then exceeding them about 18 thousand 1⁄2 after.
Askale Tafa Margasa from Ethiopia arrived second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop, Kenyane, finished third in 2:25:01.
In a city in Part, the Orgueil and the trials of Black Life
Hidden in the development of its immense park, a few miles from the sunny, brilliant and giant Orlando, is a quiet little town where pride and complications of African-American experience arise.
"Eatonville, the first completely black city to integrate, Zora Neale Hurston's childhood home, this description she made in 1935, is no longer so simple to do today."The city with five lakes, three croquet, 300 dark skins, 300 good swimmers, full of goyaves, two schools and no prison."
She has now become a city of pilgrimage
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the Zora Festival, held annually in Eatonville, to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous writer of the Renaissance Harlem.
And in various ways, the city she describes- has become a tourist thanks to its inclusion in the tourist guide of Florida edited by The Depression-era Federal Writers' Project- remains a separate place.
She is also independent, dignified, and private that she was not already in the 1930s, when hurston told that Florida's black rural population was often reluctant to share her true thoughts with the white man, who "we know so little, don't know what he's missing".
Even though it is the year of the election of a black president, Senator Barack Obama, who has also invoked an open dialogue on the subject of race, many here remain cautious of the foreign view.
"We are very careful about how to tell the story," said Hortense Jones, 59, who has always been the oldest parishioner in the city.
"It must conform to reality.
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and fighting.
At the same time, it represents a historical model of a takeover of blacks and a community of almost 2400 people where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
This is a central point but also an example of Southist black rural culture - sometimes detached, sometimes acclaimed - which recalls the birth of American slavery.
This would explain why residents are both proud and protective.
The interest in Eatonville's image born with Zora, whom everybody here calls Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world through sincere, dialectic books, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "The Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida guide transformed this city, just at the exit of Route 17, a road that crosses the centre of Florida, often forgotten, which leads to the chapter of the black history and the human drama.
Audacious such a large caisse in life as in literature, Hurston led the readers to the property store of the first mayor of Eatonville, Joe Clarke, which was then divided into several private parts.
"past the road on the left," she writes, "you will find the modern brown and white public school, with its gardens and well-preserved playgrounds, which Howard Miller has always taken care of, although he hardly knows how to read and write.
She also mentioned the new husband of Widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn" sells drinks of any kind as well as anything that can serve passing people.
So, in just a hundred words, Hurston associates Eatonville with self-government, but also with illiteracy, remarriage, and sex.
Of course, Fodor wasn't like that.
It wasn't actually a portrait everyone liked.
Zora described the reality," said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's girls who died, quoting the colourless songs, interpreted by men who praised their beauty."
She added: "Some people didn't like it."
We always remember Hurston as a living and eccentric person, who came back frequently after his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77 years old, recalled that hurston usually arrived in town without warning, aboard a large Chevrolet, a cigarette in his mouth and wearing pants here, where even today we are proud of traditional clothes.
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin told, while many mocked her.
"People were always happy to see Zora," he said.
But he also added, swinging in his back patio chair that gives on Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was certainly baptized, that "she never stayed too long."
At the death of Hurston in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of production.
Eatonville and the whole world seemed to have forgotten it.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman from Barnard College of the 1920s, she was buried in some grave, in Fort Pierce, Fla, where she lived.
In Eatonville, no great commemoration, no plaque for the general public.
I don't think they understood the contribution or legacy it offered to the world," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography of Hurston published in 2003.
A crucial moment came about in the 1980s.
Orange County public officials wanted to take a five-way highway to the city to replace Boulevard Kennedy, two-way main street in the community.
The development of Orlando has already pushed Interstate 4 to the west corner of the city.
The proposal was made when Eatonville was just about a difficult time in his history.
Forced integration, among all other things, has put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the conflict over the mix of races led to hatred at the gates of the community.
"at that time, a band of white youths came to launch oranges or objects against people sitting on the side," said Franklin.
"A lady is even dead."
They started a pie from their car" .
In a letter from 1955 addressed to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's request for forced integration, defining its decision in Brown v. Board of Education" insulting rather than glorifying my race."
Residents now proclaim that the elimination of racial segregation in schools, although positive in some respects, has diluted Eatonville's cohesion and weakened young people's confidence.
"The black children used to be kissed - I remember it well - we kissed our master in the morning, and also in the evening," said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins as well as director of the Savings of the Community of Eatonville, a non-profit group.
It lasted, she adds, until teachers and students came from the same place.
"You don't kiss your white teacher because it's white- I mean there's a cultural demarcation line here," said Melle Nathiri.
Civil rights, moreover, have created space for many other Zora Neale Hurston- black writers, actors and artists who have gone beyond harm, such as it, armed with a joyful self-confidence and lines of conduct such as: "how can they deprive themselves of the pleasure of my company!"
It's beyond me."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker visited the anonymous tomb of Hurston and began to struggle to revive his reputation.
Five years later, a biography acclamed on Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway, a real best seller, reintroduced it to the American cannons.
The highway project arrived just when Eatonville's most famous girl had found her attraction.
And this time, the old neighbors of Hurston consider her a savior.
The community began organizing a Hurston festival to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences this highway would have.
Hundreds of fans came to the inauguration of the festival two years later, and many return in January, to commemorate it.
After many years, the contents have pushed down the motorway's proposal.
"The fiasco of the five-way highway, extremely fast, a true civic pride," said Melle Nathiri.
Miss Boyd summed up the statement that "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the highway project allowed him to change his own image.
Non-residents, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been attending our church since 1993, began to come in large numbers, and residents began to reconsider the past.
Eatonville has been a historic city since 1998.
A single theme library (known as Hurston) opened in 2006 on a beautiful Kennedy Boulevard, re-enacted.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly for Florida: at six miles from Orlando, it can at any time consider itself a rear street after a summer rainy day, small as it was when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
(Today there are 90 percent blacks)
Foreigners who come to discover the story of Eatonville, his reason for being, are still treated with caution.
We must ask permission for most interviews, and some things- like the walls of the old church of Eatonville, painted by the white man, illustrating black men in the fields- should not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Miss Jones, a courageous teacher who has a low for the bright red, are always afraid that their island community will not be well understood.
However, given the expansion of the hurston festival, a certain level of local pride has emerged.
Young people in particular tend to regard Eatonville as Hurston's entire race: beautiful, problematic and all, not better or worse, but as proud, creative, bossy, crazy and mixed with other ethnic and racial groups in America.
It is of the sincere civic affection that is heard in the voice of the nephew of Mr. Franklin, Edwin Harvey, 18, who plans to return to Eatonville after the college to work for the local government or for the police forces, who need additional strength.
And even for young people, such as 11-year-old Alondra and 11-year-old Alexia Kenon, winter Park twins, seem to have learned the Eatonville description correctly.
"Most people, passing through this area, will think: "oh, this city has nothing compared to others" Alondra Kenon said after Mass last Sunday.
But if you stop and take the time to contemplate the story, it's a very beautiful city."
Here in New York, they all talk about finance.
Yet nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the kiosk and giant TV screens in Times Square, they would not realize that they are in the eye of the cyclone.
They could never think that in the glass and bee nest offices above their heads, bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York, spend the worst day of work in the office since the 1929 crack.
The delivery workers continue to falsify on the sidewalks, with their carts and muffin trays for morning meetings.
The Latino always drags between residential buildings carrying, like mules, some fifty luxurious shirts hanging on a yoke arranged on his shoulders.
Office employees continue to queue to buy their morning sandwiches to street vendors, and it's still impossible to find a taxi between 16 and 19 hours a week.
I had not felt the crisis despite the completely pessimistic accounts until this afternoon when I decided to go open a new savings account.
Fortunately, I planned to work late at noon, because I found out at my local branch of JP Morgan Chase, about 20 people tailing.
Not in front of the cashiers' window, not to withdraw from the species or make a payment, but in front of the customer service window, where regular customers ordered their cheques, tourists asked for direction for the Macy store, and new customers opened accounts.
Most of those in front of me, I'd learn later from Starr, my "authorized personal banker," all of them tailed for the same reason as I did.
Not the same, because they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks, such as those in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They withdrew their money from savings accounts known as trifts (such as a building corporation), credit associations, and the type of local savings banks and their subsidiaries that operate only in one state, who claim to treat clients as their family.
In a recent past, 15 of these banks failed.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank in the capital of $327, resorted to the bankruptcy syndic, and while the New Yorkers would return home for the weekend this Friday evening, another bank, Wachovia, in the accounts saved $440 million, desperately sought a buyer to save it.
The office and the shop employees who are in front of me, frightened of another potential debacle, have transferred their money to a bank that seems reliable to them, that is, the one that makes the most of the rescue on Wall Street.
Some New Yorkers have become very familiar with the world of finance in recent weeks.
"I heard a lady at my local Chinese supermarket, speaking on the phone of Lehman Brothers, the bank that went bankrupt, and her lean CEO Dick Furd, with the same familiarity she could have had to criticize a colleague.
And Lyn, the uniform concierge of my building, changed the subject of our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or the deliveries of my fruit and vegetables merchant.
She told me, following my visit to the bank. "I put all my savings in the money market.
"I've changed, I don't want to take risks."
Moslem tombs desecrated while Austria oscillates to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, who left the right wing of the Austrian Freedom Party and , Filip Dewinter of the Belgian Right Vlaams Belang, took part in a demonstration to present the organization of the "city against Islamization" in Antwerp, Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They wear road signs depicting red striped mosques.
The Police accuses extreme right extremists of desecrating an Austrian Muslim Cemetery, the end of the victory of the extreme political parties Right to the country's general elections.
More than 90 graves were seriously damaged at Traun Cemetery, near Linz, between Friday night and this morning; this is a police action organized.
The offenders painted on several graves, Jewish symbols such as the Star of David; however, the detectives believe that this could have been done to disguise the sense of hatred of extremists against Muslim immigrants.
This accident could in some way be related to the elections.
A spokesperson for the local Islamic Community declared to be "deeply shocked" at the announcement of this desecration, which occurs just during the religious month of Ramadan that touches on it.
Austria is seriously thinking of regaining its courage, following its oscillation to the right during yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties, which had nearly 30 percent of the votes, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, carried out an anti-immigration campaign. Some of their slogans were even considered, according to critics, to be xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won over 18 percent of the votes, led his campaign against the port of the scarf and the burkas, and even expressed his opposition to the alaha food.
During his final race in Vienna, he spoke of "a European fraternity" to avoid the rise of Islam.
Both parties are trying to prevent the construction of mosques and minarets, claiming that they would constitute a political symbol of the Islamization of Austria and Europe.
The polls and analyses carried out just after the elections have defined the extreme right as the country's strongest political bloc, which is demonstrated by the majority of young voters who made the difference, because they are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter forbids travel abroad.
The courts prohibited rock star glamour, Gary Glitter, accused of child sexual abuse, expatriation in France and Spain.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter, after he expressed to the authorities under his control, his intention to travel to Spain through France.
The Police in Kent had issued this prohibition to travel on Thursday after proving to the magistrates the guilt of Glitter for child sexual abuse.
Glitter, or his real name, Paul Gadd, was not present at the court hearing in Ashford, but was still represented by his lawyer Corker Binning.
A court spokesperson declared "Tuesday, 25 September in Ashford Court, the Kent Police requested an application to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from travelling to France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd wasn't there then."
Glitter, 64 years old, informed the authorities that he wanted to go abroad, left to be registered in the lists of accused of sexual abuse.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to go abroad for more than three days.
It must also inform the police, 7 days prior to its scheduled departure date.
If he does not communicate his movements to the authorities, he may serve a sentence of up to five years' imprisonment.
Kent's police stated that it would not discuss any particular cases or potential movements of Glitter in the contents.
A spokesman for the Kent Police said, "Kent Police will do everything they can to protect our children like those from abroad.
"in our view, it is easier to monitor someone who remains in the United Kingdom because we have devices capable of managing any potential risks, in a much more effective way.
"Protecting the people of Kent is the most expensive intention of the Kent Police, and we closely monitor the behaviour of those accused of sexual abuse in the region, in order to minimize the potential risks to the public."
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month, after having purged 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for having abused two girls, respectively, aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, Glitter took the plane to Bangkok from where he would have to board for a flight to London.
But he said he didn't feel well, and refused to leave for London.
The Thai authorities blocked him from controlling his passports, and eventually he left for Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities refused to enter their territory and were therefore forced to leave in Bangkok; the Thai police and immigration officers insisted that it return to England.
He finally arrived at Heathrow Airport Terminal 3 on August 22 and, he stayed there while his lawyer, David Corker, went to the court of limited jurisdiction of Uxbridge, West London, to register him on the list of persons accused of sexual abuse, as required by Scotland Yard.
In the past, Glitter had already been served a sentence of four months in the United Kingdom for the detention of images of child abuse.
A source from the Ministry of the Interior stated that Jacqui Smith, the Minister of the Interior, was reassured and pleased to know that Glitter had been banned from travelling in France and Spain.
"I photograph the master out of the scene to capture elements of his character" Günther Bauer - Photographer
No heels, no outer garments.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, freed from all tensions to obtain the relaxed aspect of man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Inseparable except in the intimacy, in these unknown moments of the general public, where we discover intimate gestures and stolen eyes of artists who do not care to go on stage.
German Günther Bauer mixes in "Flamenco - people" the theatre of some staging with singers, dancers and guitarists with this less-known side of artists.
In this project, the photographer resumes the specific iconography of flamenco in different angles.
Including in the programming of Flamenco Photography Month, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, more every day", explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco - people" "may be anyone but, after seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not typical images of artists on stage.
These people photographed "on the street" are artists capable of transmitting on stage passion, sadness, joy ... by captivated the audience.
To capture moments of personality of these artists you don't have to take pictures on stage.
They have a clean personality and character.
What I was interested in was to create an intimate atmosphere that allows me to capture with the camera the moments of personality of flamenco stars."
With the festival "Chant populaire des Mines", Bauer began a long journey in 1997 to photograph the singers, guitarists or dancers with a flat-screen camera.
They are portraits that, thanks to the choice of the camera and the material, reminisce the classic photography.
The implementation of different stylistic means breaks with the classic side of the image, giving it a touch of modernity, this reflects the perception of flamenco according to Bauer: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and surprises every day".
It is not about dancing or singing in itself, but about the personality and character of the artist who captures the audience with his art.
The search for the essential and the magic was the constant of this work that is being presented these days at the El Fotómata gallery.
The flamenco stars such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are part of the selection made from about seventy artists photographed.
The project has become an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a collection book of portraits exhibited at the gallery.
The passion for Bauer's portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with the "Portraits of Old Sports" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco - people", the photographer admits that he loves to photograph the portrait of people, to know them and to be able to enter into their lives for a moment or less.
I think in photography the portrait is the most difficult kind.
You're in front of people, people that sometimes you don't know or leave you just a few minutes to get a picture of them.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try that my ideas become reality."
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco called "Flamenco - people", is exhibited at the Galerie El Fotómata, located at the number 20 of the rue de la Mata (road parallel to the People's of Hercules) which will be opened until 16 October next.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is "true bold"
The novel takes place in places nobody knows and deals with unknown subjects, but once again, Mario Vargas Llosa is determined to advance the new project on which he works, a novel that has for principal character Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who has lived twenty years in Congo and passed through Amazonia.
The Nobel Prize-winning prize for Literature yesterday confessed to the Hay Festival Segovia, that the novel currently occupying it "is a real audacity" and that "all demonstrates that it should not write it".
"If I was reasonable, I wouldn't, but I'm going to do it and I hope to finish it," he concluded in his intervention at the festival of exchange of ideas and thoughts that for four days he saw parade in the city of watering a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was the most expected character of the third edition of this festival and has completed his contract.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival prize with the majority of the votes of the participants, held a meeting room at the Juan Bravo Theatre.
The presenter of the Festival, Félix Romeo, found himself in front of a fascinating audience who did not see the past hour during which the Peruvien, with a wonderful memory and with a great amount of humor, traced the birth of his literary vocation, which is due to "his thirst to read" and "to experience new experiences"; how he wrote of a "very methodical manner" thanks to an intense work of documentation, correcting and rewriting part of the text to face his "inspirational hunger"; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas influenced his vocation and how his memories inspire his novels.
The Spanish-American novelist recognized that "there is no means" to measure and to know if books change life."But I refuse to believe that literature is a pure fun, an ephemeral experience," Vargas Llosa said, who said that it "has effects" and "makes people less like", because writers were asked "not to let go to the frivolity" and to assume their vocation.
Bad weather spoils the fair of Pozoblanco
The banner party that concluded the bull races at the Pozoblanco Fair was suspended yesterday morning, after the bullfighters checked that the arena was impracticable.
In this way, the organizational committee, in agreement with Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Léonard Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the bull race.
The evil of time stuck in this fair, since finally two out of three parties could not take place.
On Saturday it was rain that prevented the celebration of the second course of bulls planned.
At the poster, there was José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz y Juan Bautista, who should have fought in the arena of Castilblanco.
So only the Friday party took place
On Friday, the winner was Daniel Luque who cut three ears and was triumphed, after making movements of arms in front of the bull with taste and aesthetics.
In the afternoon, Alejandro Talavante concluded two banners planted on the bull's back and a cut ear that the exposed steps applauded more than his own fight with the bull.
Even worse for El Juli, who entered the arenas of Los Llanos without pity or glory.
In his fight with the second bull, after a much better fight, he was blown up by most of the public.
Police control of a van in the province of Alava: two thousand kilos of hachisch found
Five hours minus ten in the morning.
Control of the movement of the Euskadi Police (Ertzaintza) at the border of the Comune d'Arminón (Alva).
Police officers arrest two occupants of a van and these two undertake escape.
Its loading, more than two tons of hachisch, what to stop them.
The police prosecuted them and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old man identified as A. A. J., according to information provided by the Department of the Interior of the Basque Government.
The arrested individual was charged with drug trafficking and forgery of documents.
The incident took place when various officials of the Alava Traffic Unit carried out vehicle control on the N-1 at the border of the Comune d'Arminón.
They were ready to stop a van to inspect it when the driver disobeyed orders, suddenly accelerated and control began.
The police began their pursuit until the vehicle stopped two kilometres further on the coast, where the two occupants went down to flee to a wooded area.
The Basque police finally arrested one of the two occupants and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hachish they carried and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The later part of the vehicle was loaded with achisch balloons, and then they moved to a police station for comprehensive inspection and to weigh the drug.
In addition, officials found that the registration plate had been "false" since it did not coincide with the one written on the gray card of the van, that is also why they charged the prisoner with a crime of falsification of documents.
Ertzaintza continues its investigation to arrest the other suspect, who managed to escape and determine the origin of the seized drug.
The 28-year-old A. A. J. has been warned to carry out the various steps and will be tried in the following hours.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the effects of a drug
Actress Heather Locklear, the famous Amanda from the Melrose Place TV series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Bárbara (California) for driving under the effects of a drug.
A witness saw him make strange maneuvers by trying to get out of his garage in Montecito, according to what a spokesperson for the California police patrol revealed to the People magazine.
The witness said that around 4:30 p.m., Locklear "supported the accelerator in the background, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the garage, and going back several times, she rolled over her sunglasses."
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who at first had not recognized the actress, saw that Locklear stopped in the middle of the highway and got out of his vehicle.
This person, at that time, called emergency services because "she was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which partially blocked the road.
"She looked disoriented," which is why the agents took her to the drug and alcohol center to carry out a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and alcohol abuse was eliminated from the beginning, although "according to the observation of the police officers at first sight, we thought Locklear was under the influence of a drug."
Locklear was arrested being suspected of having led under the effect of a substance that was not specified and was imprisoned around 7 p.m. and released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left the clinic in Arizona where she was hospitalized to treat a nervous breakdown.
Llamares has requested the Andalusian Federation of the United Left to assume its responsibilities in the Silva case
The Coordinator General and Member of the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, today stated that it is the regional federation to take a decision on the case of the former Youth and Sports Advisor of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of performing treatment for his family members.
"In these cases, I am very federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that will have to assume its responsibilities," Llamazares said with regard to the behaviour of the political party that he will have to adopt in the municipal council of Seville.
However, the leader of the United Left asked that investigations show "transparency" for the irregularities that Silva might have committed: "The United Left has always defended this kind of business for them to have a maximum degree of transparency".
He also stressed that the political party has "very strict ethical codes for all officials".
"Mayo Blood," Garci's osé bet
By drawing inspiration from the accounts of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recreates the famous battle of the Spaniards against the French in "Sangre de maggio", which is the most ambitious film of his filmography with nearly 15 million euros of budget.
The filmmaker tried to "set up the many characters and illustrate the social analysis" he always admired in the work of the famous novelist, explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of the long list of actors.
The film of more than two and a half hours, "May Blood", will be released in the cinemas next Friday, which will then become a television series for Telemadrid by more than four hours.
A great admirer of the literature of Galdós, José Luis Garci ensures that he realized with this film "a dream of a child" thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who three years ago commissioned him to film a commemorative film for the two hundred years of May 2nd Madrid, which he always accepted when the story was held to national historical facts.
The €15 million provided by the Madrid Commune is a "one-time opportunity" for Garci to reproduce with the appropriate decorations and clothing the atmosphere of "a Spain that has deceived itself as a leader in the struggle for independence, since the struggle for independence has led the people to rebellions under the rule of Ferdinand VII", he said.
But the filmmaker regrets that he did not get funding as for the films "Captain Alatriste" or "The Ghosts of Goya" - more than twice as much as the one obtained for "Mayo Blood"-, because he could not shoot some scenes written in a script signed by Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he collaborated during almost his entire career.
The filmmaker of "Retour has begun" has influenced his usual way of working, on the stage of actors, with whom he usually repeats before starting the shooting and to whom he does not make casting, since it seems "humiliant" to him and considers that "the role of the filmmaker is to go to the theatre and to the cinema to keep himself informed".
Many actors in "Sangre de maggio" repeat before the camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Four times candidate for Oscar (he won one), Garci considers that the three candidate films that represent Spain this year at the Academy of Hollywood, "Sangre de maggio", "Seven tables of French billiards" and finally the winner," "The blind sunflowers", are not representative of the young Spanish cinema, "which would deserve to be better known," he said.
With this movie Garci doesn't expect a price.
"At first you think you're working for the posterity, then you realize that you're working only for prosperity, and now you're happy to make an extra movie," Garci explains after more than 30 years of career.
Isabelle Bayón gets into the skin of the Serbian dancer Tortola Valencia
A sevillane dancer will pay tribute to an equally sevillane dancer.
Carmen Tortola Valencia, daughter of a Catalan father (Florenç Tortola Ferrer) and of an Andalusian mother (Georgeina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district and who at the age of three will live in London with his family.
She was a free dance dancer and Oriental dance specialist.
She had an exciting life, a pioneer in women's liberation, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was Buddhist and vegetarian and advocated for the abolition of the corset that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman, who has marked the history of dance in Europe in between wars, has fascinated Isabelle Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and the latter offered to interpret the Danes of Seville Tortola Valencia and it seemed incredible to me."
According to the dancer, "we try not to tell her life but to translate her way of thinking.
His dance titles made me think of flamenco.
Thus, "the butterfly dance" made me think of a popular Cuban dance and "the snake dance" to some tangos.
Her dance was sensual and they told me that my way of dancing was identical to hers," she says.
The performance was done with two remarkable contributions: that of Miguel Poveda who will again sing Isabela in one of his performances, as he had done at "The Open Door"; and that of Professor Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to collaborate with the one who was his student.
"Matilde turns Tortola into a mature character.
I'm happy because she agreed to play a role in my work and it honors me."
The performance was also made thanks to the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres y Paco Arriaga, the popular song by Michel Ortega, el Pulga y Moi de Morón; the percussions of El Pájaro, as well as the rape of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "who plays the role of the eternal companion of this kind of artists who were considered divas".
This work also tells, in a certain way, of the life of this woman who has exhibited herself in such distant places, especially for the time, as in India, the United States, or Russia, but also throughout Europe, since she was usually living in London.
"I wanted to remind her because I think it's these women who have enormous influence in their time and now nobody knows and does not highlight her work," says Bayón.
The show will begin at 8:30 p.m. at the theater Lope de Vega
The publication of the "Newly Married Poet's Journal" concludes the Triennat
The presentation of the first edition illustrated by the "Newly Married Poet's Journal" in Saint Stephen's Church in New York, where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia to celebrate the "Triennat Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature and their deaths.
In this way, the "Trentennat Zenobia and Juan Ramón" arrives at its end with the re-editation of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and with the travelling exhibition " Juan Ramón Jiménez: This poplar of light" that was inaugurated in May and that, after travelling in the various Andalusian provinces, will go to New York at the International Congress.
Similarly, the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia purchased eight hundred copies of the "Newly Married Journal of a Poet", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to perpetuate the work of one of the most known Andalusian poets.
America less without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people
Paul Newman was part of it."
This phrase is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him in the "absence of malice", and illustrates the despair of American cinema, and all America, in the face of the shocking idea that Newman is no longer in this world.
He was in pain to get an Oscar.
He hasn't turned since 2007.
Everyone knew he was sick.
That was a hard time for everyone.
"Sometimes what one feels goes beyond all expression, and now I've lost a great friend," cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better thanks to its existence."
No one was afraid to become ridiculous or exaggerate.
One of the fathers of the cinema and the country died during a particularly dark period, where terrorists and stock markets were afraid, the American esteem was low, desperately seeking reasons for dignity.
When times are so hard and without reason to live, there is only human beings admiration and there is no need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
He embodied for everyone an ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the enemy of Richard Nixon and the defender of lost and defeated causes, such as the foundation for the drug fighting created in honor of his deceased elder following an overdose and the creation of his own bio food brand.
It was a victory for a country that was struggling against a suicidal food culture.
This expanding wave of admiration swept Hollywood without paying attention to both nationalities and passports.
The last James Bond, Englishman Daniel Craig, found that no James Bond died before him.
Another Englishman, the oscarized Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman marked the top of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to name Newman as his greatest inspiration.
"He put us in the top bar," said George Clooney, who is perhaps the only one today trying to break the screen as Paul Newman did: being very honest and having a serious privacy and far from goals.
It's still not easy or possible in the media jungle today.
But there's the one who's trying, and Paul Newman is an example.
After a divorce, he was married to Joanne Woodward for fifty years, to whom he was faithful even though the opportunities were not enough for him not to be.
"But why should I eat a hamburger out of my house, if I have a steak in my fridge?" he used to joke.
In heaven, he proudly attends to meet his daughters with his fans on earth, something that is not so common in America.
"In all the great roles he has played, he has never been as proud as the dedicated husband, the loving father, the caring grandfather and philanthropic," he says.
Madrid in the race for the 2016 Olympic Games
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid can organize the Olympic Games, after the failed in 2012, this could take place in 2016.
But I wonder if we're ready.
If we take the example of yesterday's race: we are not!
They call it the perfect race, but I think it was the worst race I've ever taken.
If they had taken into account all the errors that occurred during the race, they would have been the subject of an elimination note.
But let's look at everything in detail and from the beginning.
Mistakes begin with the removal of the backrests, which forces you to go ahead.
It's not bad, but if they make you move it would be better if they gave you everything (including the electronic chip for the races).
Well, no.
They made you go there just to take the back (first mistake, move only for this) and (after a long queue) surprise!, there was only the size 'S' for the jersey (second mistake, because I need an XL size)
In what world do we live?
Is it because of the crisis they have decided to buy that small jerseys with less tissue and at least expensive?
Well, this is nothing compared to what happened on the day of the races.
Apart from the fact that we have to go there very early to remove the electronic chip, the waiting line is 15 minutes and, moreover, we have to leave the bag behind the entrance.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible as 11,000 people are expected for these races.
Since there was a long line of waiting, the competitions started and we had not yet left our bag behind at the entrance, although once we did, the withdrawal was worse.
In addition, the rain accompanied the waiting period of more than 40 minutes during which rebellions and attacks took place in the barracks.
I think about 500 people will have pneumonia tomorrow, and some people like me, we won't even be in the classification with the exact time, because of the chip they gave me that, I think, didn't exactly score the start.
Of course, if they asked me to cite an example of a perfect race, it would not come to my mind above all.
So I think we can always dream of becoming the host city for the 2016 J.O..
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtuelle)
At MIT Microsoft's conference on Emerging Technologies, a new system of image recognition and human interaction was introduced, a kind of Artificial Intelligence with little intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to travel on the business campus) in response to what was requested during a conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people there are in the place, who are - including remembering which positions they occupy - and listening to and listening to the key words of their conversations.
But also bring them together by conversation groups
In the video presentation, the receptionist detects a third person but she understands that she does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that she is not part of the company.
She asks if she's here to visit someone and she tells her that she will answer him in a few moments.
All this without a blue screen.
Impressive.
But of course this represents the future.
Now the company has other things to focus on, for example on the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week, we talked about a change in Microsoft's strategy.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will no longer have associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if computers were sold with the indispensable instead of unnecessary applications, they would go five times faster.
This represents a discovery since Microsoft, version after version, has not stopped adding functions and "extras" to Windows.
The change of strategy is welcome.
Microsoft is right, its operating system is losing its importance but also its software.
When Google Chrome arrived on the network, I was one of those who adhered to the theory that Google Chrome is the first step by Google to compete with Windows.
Several people rightly pointed out that an Internet browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary as this is the essential basis for the understanding of computer equipment and software.
He handles the same function as your wife or husband when you have to say something to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never disappear but we must see the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth but as a relative truth.
This week, Ballmer confirmed this idea.
People pay less and less attention to the operating system but more and more to the Internet browser.
We light up the computer only to turn Firefox, Explorer, or Chrome and every day people spend more time browsing the Internet than going through windows.
Who serves half of the applications provided with the system?
Who can most can at least.
And Windows 7 will have to contain less applications, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, month clumsy, less complex.
For the moment, Microsoft is more interested in launching its own online services to finally become an alternative to Google.
They desperately need this, indeed, and I show you an example.
The photo presented in this article, was taken at the beginning of this month in one of the rest rooms reserved for Microsoft employees in Redmond.
On the beverage distributor, a poster asks them to use their own search tool - "Ta search. Our future".
In 2006, a study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search for information on the Internet.
Last week a delay occurred in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not come out in early 2009 but by the end of 2009 or see 2010.
Microsoft will certainly try to launch at the same time Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, looks more and more like a computer.
But the launch of Android being late and the iPhone is already on the market, it will cost them dearly.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso was lying on the Côte d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio wore one in Edward Zwick's 'blood Diamond, as well as Al Pacino in 'Le Parrain' by Francis Ford Coppola and is part of the holding of the association of the gay muscles.
And if we put all of his appearances on the list, we could also quote this moustache that raised weights in an encircling circus.
It's not just a men's shirt in cotton, weaving and without sleeves.
The English call it 'tank' but the Fabulous Marcel of Brussels stands out among all the others.
First of all, by his flamboyant name - although it is known as ' Marcel' - which has to do with sport since he takes the name, according to legend, of boxer Marcel Cerdan, a lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
Marcel ' is distinguished from others by his excellent cotton, by his unisex cup, by his distinctive logo and by the little Belgian flag (unrecognisable) that the most known body jerseys have in the neck.
But be careful, because the Belgian brand does not only produce top tanks.
But it also produces sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, babes, mini-shorts...
Dresses designed for the comfort of underwear.
Even if it's too bad to wear them just as underwear.
They're too charming.
"I want to become a young mother; the candidate doesn't worry me"
His enormous resemblance to his sister did not prevent him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
At present, Sisters Cruz take their new activity very seriously in fashion.
According to Monica, they are not just beautiful and famous girls who give their names.
She was present at the promotion that the Mango brand made in Paris at its new headquarters but also at the presentation of the most important prices of the fashion that the Spanish home sponsored.
Monica is warm and shy.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I created for Mango for the new fall-winter season, but also to attend the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the opera dinner in Valentino's honor.
A very intense day but, at the same time, exciting, awaits us.
On what basis is your new collection created for Mango for this fourth season?
The cinema in the 1950s and 1960s enchants us and we inspire much for our collections.
I love to walk around town and watch women to see how they're dressed, how they combine their clothes, I do it often.
Dancer, actress and designer, you're a very versatile woman: aren't you?
I think so, but in the end everything comes together and these activities have a lot in common.
Since I was very little, I liked the clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother's home to look in my aunt's wardrobes and to see her clothes.
It was great, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, when I became a dancer, I always tried to take care of my dress.
The dancers like to dress very well for courses and tests, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress, when you wear your clothes, it's at that moment that you actually put yourself in the character's skin.
All of a sudden, it's all tied up.
You haven't been there for 30 years. Was that hard for you?
Not at all.
I feel better than ever, my 30s rejoice.
I find that the woman is maturer, has more experience and enjoy life with fewer problems.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I've done all the things I wanted to do since I was a child and it has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, you think you're gonna become a mom?
Of course, I want to become a mother because my body asks me for it and, besides, I want to become a young mother; I don't want to lose it.
As far as the candidate is concerned, I'm not worried.
What I will do is give my son a lot of happiness and raise him with a lot of love.
Let's go to the movies, you're waiting for the different movies you shot last year to come out.
True, I'm looking forward to them coming out.
I who am a woman from the theatre, I am very impatient and worried, I would like to have everything now but of course this is not possible.
I look forward to the fate of the films 'The Last Hour' and 'In search of the tomb of Christ'.
Let's see what you'll think...
A few days ago you started on the bridge with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Don't say that!
I didn't get on the bridge to make the model.
Simply, Naomi Campbell called me, I have known her for not long, to invite me to participate in a charity parade in London for her association in favor of support for women and the clothes we were displaying - I exhibited two clothes from our collection created for Mango - were sold at auction to collect money for Naomi's NGO.
The people Naomi is a tender person.
They say so much about her, I know her, many things aren't true.
Besides, this nice side of Naomi fascinates me.
She asked me to parade for such a noble cause, but if she had asked me to pry, I would have done it anyway.
The important thing is to make women in the third world better.
Recidivists of alcohol at the wheel will have to install the 'alcock' system
The Minister of the Interior wants the driver who has had more than three administrative penalties for alcoholism, to install in his vehicle a system that prevents him from starting the vehicle in a state of drunkenness, or if he does not suffer from it.
The initiative was already announced last June and now appears in the report of the Minister of State in which this initiative is considered to be a pilot project that will last one year.
Its purpose is to reintegrate the driver by offering him road rehabilitation courses.
The Minister of State for Road Safety, as well as the Directorate-General for Road Safety and the Institute for Automobile Safety Foundation, will participate in this initiative.
According to the statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists arrested for driving more than once in a state of drunkenness resume the car.
The alcohol would avoid this because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the alcohol rate in the haloine and prevents the vehicle from starting if the driver does not blow before; or when the driver's alcohol rate is higher than the allowed one.
Its cost is over 1,000 euros and is borne by the driver.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with this device reduced up to 65% of the offences during the first year of installation.
And in Spain it is estimated that this could save 115 people every year.
This is based only on administrative sanctions for two reasons: dealing with these behaviours before they become criminal offences.
And facilitate its implementation, since legal reform can be done by ordinary means, but, however, criminal reform requires reform of the organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial form, although some industrial and functional vehicles already have an experimental form.
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on an initiative of the Spanish Socialist Party which proposes to install this system in school buses as has been done in France.
In Mexico without 'peep-toes'
At 5:40 p.m., the scheduled official hour, the plane of the Spanish air force in which the Princes of Asturias were travelling landed in the Presidential Hangar of the Benito Juárez airport of Mexico DF.
The sun was on the eve of bed, but his rays still forced him to put his hand as a visor in order to see the royal couple get off the plane.
At the foot of the staircase, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities were present.
A few hours earlier I had asked in the street, to the taxi driver, if he knew the Spanish Princes were visiting the city to finish their official trip.
- Oh, all right, so we can't go to the airport to pick up customers at this time... are you from here or then...?
- No, no, sir, I'm Spanish, but I lived here thinking two years.
- Oh, very good...
But the Mexican press knows very well who are the Princes of Asturias and knows the importance of travel.
There are several waiting in the airport hangar near the red carpet and a military range of 27 marine soldiers.
The Prince is smiling and dressed in sea blue, the Princess, when she has her hair in the wind, is dressed very excessively and does not wear her usual 'peep-toes'; perhaps they had told her that a storm was threatening.
They make a brief stop at the photographers before they go to the room where the official court awaits them.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the four largest hotels in the city, a ridiculous Mexican television journalist awaits them.
The most prestigious price of fashion
Surely there is no place more suitable in the world to present a fashion price than Paris and there is certainly no living designer more extraordinary and good living than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the Mango Fashion Awards, in order to strengthen the international image of new fashion talent.
The winner will be rewarded by a price of €300,000.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at his models in the window of Mango at the 54 Haussmann boulevard in Paris and she cried almost with emotion.
True, it is the second largest store in Europe that has just been inaugurated with 1,335 square meters of surface.
The first shop is in London.
The events, as well as the desire to thank the stylist Valentino, president of the competition jury, made us find ourselves in a luxurious dinner at opera Garnier de Paris.
With a table next to that of the extraordinary Chagals family, the Presidential table prepared by Mango seemed even more spectacular.
Having big on the heart and making bad fortune good heart, because of the recent death of his brother, Nati put on a dress of Mango and some beads of ELAH, who cut the breath, and arms on it, arms beneath with his son Luis - a beautiful man almost two meters high - she accompanied Valentino to his dinner prepared in his honor.
Andik, the owner of Mango, a gallant man, as well as the Baron de Rotchil ended the evening without a vestion because they had lent them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who showed up at the store with a pair of pants and shirts - from her own collection - and who for dinner metamorphized by wearing a sexy and black long dress, was moved when during the night visit of the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us the hall of ballet rehearsals and recalling the good old time, she grabbed one of the bars and she made the gesture of a 'big fold'.
Inés Sastre did not stay for the visit of the palace's dependencies, but she showed us before on her mobile phone the photos of her son.
The next morning, we had the pleasure of seeing Olivier Martínez – another beautiful man who moves by motorcycle – and John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his sheets, towels and having asked in advance, that there is no smell in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, there's life.
1001, the antistress number
There are only 1000 but 1001 ways to forget the chaos and frenzy of daily life.
And to crown it all, they are all listed in a book that will bring relaxation to the bookstores on September 30.
The morning awakening almost appeals to us when it rings every morning at 7 o'clock, but it's even worse when we think of the rhythm of activity that imposes on us the present life.
The office is synonymous with tension and the back pain computer.
Stress represents the evil of the 21st century.
But there is neither one nor two methods to combat day-to-day fatigue and work-related problems.
But 1001, not one more, not one less.
Apart from yoga positions, classical massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott gathers in the pages of a book an 'menu' of methods adapted to the taste and time of each.
The antistress work is called '1001 ways to relax' and will arrive at the booksellers directly from the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that it is not possible to obtain tranquility in places such as work or through personal relationships, this 'manuel' denies such belief.
In addition, this manual offers other methods such as contact with nature or natural recipes 100% that help you relax.
If adrenaline does not run in your veins to restore the balance of your body and if stress has become a problem, it is time to sit in the couch, disconnect from your mind and focus on reading.
Talk Sleeping
Some kids talk during the night.
I do not refer to those who wake up very awake by telling us something that happened the day before, but to the children who talk during their sleep.
The first time this happens it may surprise you, but in reality it doesn't matter.
It's a benign sleep disorder that's called sleepwalking.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
It's sure there's more than one talking during the night.
This phenomenon may appear very sporadic (once in life, for example, associated with an episode of severe fever), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the day after the child no longer remembers anything.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance
They are often related to other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night terrors, night enuresis (pipi-bed) or sleepwalking, but this is not always the case.
As mentioned earlier, they can also be associated with very strong fever, stress or overexcitement.
In any case, it's a poorly studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it occurs is also very variable.
He may speak with a quiet little voice, with isolated words, murmurs or on the contrary with screams, cries, long speeches ...
If sleeping becomes very frequent, it would be wise to observe the child and consult a specialist, to check whether there is a problem that causes a lot of anxiety and to get an explanation for this problem.
We said it is a benign alteration, so there is no treatment, unless it is related to another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, if it is related to a sleep apnea or stress).
What we can do is take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child before going to sleep.
Therefore, look for quiet games and avoid television shows or programs that are more or less violent.
With very nervous children who have difficulty relaxing, relaxation techniques can be used to help them calm internally.
This will allow the child to have a more peaceful sleep.
As soon as sleepwalks appear try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will not remember what happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake him up.
It's useless because he's unconscious and you'd wake him up.
Even if he speaks, he sleeps and rests.
Remember that if he is very anxious several times, it is advisable to consult a doctor or check what causes so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not usual), do not be tempted to question him for information.
You won't get anything, because he's sleeping in it, he's not aware to be able to organize his thinking.
In addition, you will hear what he says, but you will not know what he is dreaming about, suddenly watch out for the way you interpret the information and conclusions you draw.
Never tell the child that you can ask him during the night to know his secrets.
Not even joking.
This causes a lot of anxiety.
In conclusion, don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... at last
Illhaeusern finally found the way to victory on his field after a long period of disette.
Without making a big game, the Yellows and Blacks have created themselves the most opportunities and managed to transform one for the game's gain.
The pace was not very sustained during this meeting where the attackers were having trouble expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by Captain Kauffmann who floundered the lucarne on a long shot, Illhaeusern would take the climber and turn turn from afar, then with Hirn above, Romein at the end of the foot or Diebold came to chat with Dannemarie's defense.
In front of us, we were building a block in the middle of the ground and we were just leaving Riahi to the tip of the attack.
The beginning of the second half-time would be decisive with first two occasions signed Riahi and Temporale for Dannemaria, and immediately after the opening of the score for the Illhousians by Marais, well positioned to resume a ball set on a first attempt by Diebold (53rd').
But the Illhousian Butter will not be able to taste his happiness long and will be obliged to return the lockers a dozen minutes later and thus leave his teammates in digital inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not be able to take advantage of it and will not pose any big problems to an Illuish Onze who just pulled back a little bit to "compact" his defense, ogreed in the last few seconds of play where, after a big cockpit, the ball passed very close to the transverse.
Sarkozy at the meeting of angry fishermen
Before flying for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy is going to turn around Britain.
In the face of the demonstration of the fishing force that severely disturbed Monday the access of several Breton and Norman ports, the President of the Republic decided to visit on Tuesday morning at the port of Guilvinec, in the Finistère, to meet with their representatives there.
They promised to welcome him "in a constructive spirit" and hoped that he would "come with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit that falls at the same time as a general meeting of the "crisis committee" created by the Breton fishermen to obtain measures against the flow of diesel prices, which reached a record of more than 1.14 euros per litre on average.
According to Elysée David Martinon's spokesperson, the president "will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their companies regain competitiveness and to secure the conditions of employment and compensation for the sailors".
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected to stand firmly by the fishermen.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out snail operations in Morbihan and Calvados, causing stoppers of nearly 10 km.
Quiberon's pleasure port was also blocked, but the links to Belle-Isla were not stopped.
A leaking dam was launched on Quiberon's peninsula.
The sailors have already demonstrated their determination on Monday by burning, from dawn, tires and pallets in front of the fuel deposits of the ports of Brest, and Lorient, while demonstrations took place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports of the Atlantic facade and the Manche, as in the Sables of Olonne, in Vendée, where the trawlers remained at docks, or at Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the movements of commercial ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and the Croisic, in Loire-Atlantique, stopped in the evening the blockade of the important total refinery of Donges.
Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the Wednesday meeting to be held in the department to decide on possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" must decide on Tuesday to follow up on the movement and its participation in the interview scheduled for the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by officials of the National Fisheries Committee, who did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "fishers will not let go" and "don't want to move to Paris", for example announced Liliane Cariou, the chairman of the Eastern Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on the gazelle, currently pay about 50 cents per litre but believe that the cost-effectiveness threshold of a vessel is only reached with a diesel less than € 0.30 per litre.
Paul Newman The Magnificent
The unforgettable performer of "Butch Cassidy and the Kid" died as a result of cancer, at the age of 83, in his Connecticut home.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes hailed the film legend and the committed actor, Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embracing maintains its delivery forecast in 2008
Brazil's aircraft is 215 aircraft delivered this year in spite of the recession threats on the world economy.
The fourth world aircraft manufacturer, Embraer, maintains its 2008 delivery forecasts with 215 delivered aircraft, reaffirmed Fredrico Fleury Curado, its president.
In the first half, the plane delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer looks forward to the Chinese market, particularly for its range of aircraft ranging from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG plans to transfer more than 15% of its assets
The insurer American International Group, which the U.S. monetary authorities have cooled, plans to sell more than 15% of its assets to reimburse the $85 billion it has received, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is ready to study the sale of most of its activities beyond its international life insurance and retirement activity in the United States, states the newspaper that lists sources close to the file.
The AIG Board of Directors met on Sunday evening to examine possible transfers, according to the FT.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets of which IGA plans to separate include its International Lease Financial Corp. Air Leasing subsidiary, its 59% share in the Transatlantic Holdings Resettlement and its real estate portfolio and its investments in private equity, adds the FT.
No final decision has been taken on these transfers, FT continues.
AIG must quickly cash in order to repay the loan of 85 billion that the Federal Reserve has granted it at the risk of the US authorities taking 80% of its capital, diluting the current shareholders by two proportions.
Analysis Paris History of the sitting Morning Meeting History Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange accused a historic fall Monday after the rejection by the House of Representatives of the Paulson Bank Rescue Plan: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a loss never seen approaching the 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dived from 777.68 points to 1O.365.45 points.
In terms of points, the biggest drop in history (684,81 points) had previously been recorded on 17 September 2001, on the day of the resumption of trade after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The technologically dominant Nasdaq index gave rise to 199.61 points to 1,983.73 and the larger Standard & Poor's 500 8.81% ( 106.85 points), to 1,106.55 points, according to the final closing figures.
Already depressed at the beginning of the session, Wall Street sank after the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the Banks Rescue Plan that was expected to restore a bit of stability in the markets.
By 228 votes against and 205 in favour, the representatives denied the Secretary to the Treasury Henry Paulson the means he requested.
Nearly two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
"This is a bad signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"This shows how much the market counts on this," she added, fearing that a project adopted within several days will not come "too late".
"If the project is indeed dying (...) then the relay will be quickly passed to the Fed (the U.S. Central Bank, Ndlr) and other central banks to manage the crisis, which would further tighten credit conditions," said Brian Bethune, economic leader at Global Insight.
And intensifying the sense of urgency, "every day that passes brings the fall of a financial institution" to the United States, pointed out Mrs. Piegza.
After the Washington Mutual bankruptcy on Friday, the authorities organized the purchase of the banking activities of Wachovia by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has sharply accelerated, leading to emergency interventions for banks in the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, indicating that markets are facing "not only an American crisis, but a global crisis", said FTN Financial analyst.
The bond market has grown strongly.
Ten-year Treasury Bond performance declined to 3,632%, compared to 3,827% on Friday night, and the 30-year-old at 4,161%, compared to 4,357% on the eve.
Obama, winner at the points of the first television duel
In the first Friday debate between the two candidates at the White House succeeded another to find out who took it from John McCain or Barack Obama.
Without surprise, the Republican and Democratic campaign QGs proclaimed their own victory in this television duel which would have been followed by one third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, although honorable, was not quite "bright" enough to allow him to slow down in the five-week presidential polls.
The Gallup Institute, whose poll was published on Saturday, gave Obama a five-point advance (49% versus 44% in McCain), judges that it was the democrat who drew his pin from the game.
In the undecided voters, who are the ones who count, Obama was victorious for 39% of the polls, while 25% of them grant McCain victory, according to a CBS survey.
Obama should be able to confirm his progress on Thursday with the good performance expected of his colister, Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
"This would be a mistake of underestimating it.
She has good instincts," however Bill Clinton warned this weekend.
The seven-year-old McCain continued to highlight his undisputed experience in foreign policy, while highlighting the "naïvety" of his opponent on these issues that were at the heart of this first face-to-face.
" Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that..." he has accused several times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge needed to be president," he also assured.
An angle of attack hammered since yesterday in Republican television ads.
Obama stressed that he represented the future.
Without distancing himself, he proved concise and precise.
He highlighted his ability to make the right decisions, and to restore the image of the United States around the world.
"McCain has not yet understood, while Obama, yes", retorted, this weekend, a democratic spot against the Republican to have not taken the full measure of the impact of the crisis on the "American of the Street".
"During the ninety-minute debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you, Obama said yesterday, in front of 20,000 people in front of an election meeting in North Carolina under heavy rain.
He didn't even say the words "middle class" or "worker."The financial downturn clearly benefits Obama, who is seen by the Americans as the best way to save the economy on the edge of the precipice.
"The coming week could be a decisive turn," said yesterday, the influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
The Democratic representative of Rahm Emanuel, an old Clinton administration, compared Obama's "good economic instincts" to that of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current debacle "is the final eight-year verdict of a bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain."
Reiterating that it would still reduce the taxes of 95 per cent of Americans in spite of Wall Street's surmounts, the Illinois Senator also noted that the achievement of potential energy independence in the country through the promotion of renewable energy was his first priority, with the establishment of a health insurance system.
McCain, he, wanted to build a park of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Prudents, the two candidates avoided the financial rescue issues of $700 billion (€470 billion) adopted last night by Congress and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "did you notice there was an election?"
Young people and opponents manifested Sunday night in the main place of the capital of Belarus to reject the results of legislation in advance.
A few hundred in Belarus met on Sunday evening as soon as the polling stations were closed in Minsk Central to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislatures.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexandre Lukashenko: "the dictator, resign".
Some confessors have not even voted: "What good, because they will do what they want of my voice," said one young man.
They do not believe that the regime that has been good for foreign observers in order to resume language with the European Union is ready to take a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including the prohibition of visas for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered to be clean by observers.
They didn't do it under the opposition.
"We have been kept away from the electoral commissions and our observers have not been able to participate in the removal," lamented Iuri Potemkine, the spokesperson for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous grouping of twelve parties.
"It's a cosmetic change," said Alexandre Milinkievich, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, because it's the important thing that counts the voices, and at home, it's the executive power.
If members of the opposition come to Parliament, they will have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament can mean space on television, meetings in the regions and proposals for laws."
The opposition must therefore enter into the political game because " dialogue with the European Union must begin.
For if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, enters into crisis, and we do not reform, we may become a protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which followed the electoral process, does not recognize the validity of the vote.
She pointed out that participation figures seemed too high, and that the generalization of advance voting (26% of voters in Minsk) opened the voice to all manipulations.
"You have noticed that there was an election, you ask the Social Democratic Leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be no more than five members of the opposition to parliament, those who are best suited to power."
The silence of the night returns to the place of October.
On television, President Lukashenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission welcomed their success.
Interview - Blood came back safe
Hema-Québec celebrated the 10th anniversary of his foundation yesterday, and his president, Dr. Francine Decary, was right to rejoice, because Hema-Québec became one of the most secure and effective blood suppliers in the world.
And above all, he regained the public's confidence that had been seriously shaken by the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were contaminated by the acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In the face of this drama and the public, the Government of Canada in February 1994 instituted a public inquiry, chaired by Judge Horace Krever, which aimed to shed light on the circumstances leading to such a tragedy and to make recommendations for such a disaster to cease to occur.
While Judge Krever was slow to file his report, some provinces then set up a committee to plan for a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau committee has fulfilled this mandate.
Following the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Hema-Québec to serve Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to supply all other provinces and two territories.
"In 1998, when Hema-Québec started his activities, only 38% of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec, Dr. Decary recalled.
The situation was discouraging.
In an effort to improve the safety of blood products and work in the field during the years that followed, we have regained public confidence," she said before proudly stating that in early 2008, nearly 94% of the Quebec population had now trusted in Hema-Québec.
Dr. Decary, however, has to bear in mind that "trust is something extremely fragile."
From its creation on 28 September 1998, Hema-Québec applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, there were many cases in Europe of the human form of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease, which has been holding the fort since its foundation in 1998.
"And we did not know at all whether this disease could be transmitted by blood.
One of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports was that when one does not know about it and a serious disease may result, in this case the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterized by a degeneration of the brain which inevitably leads to death, exclusion measures are introduced.
In April 1999, the blood of those who had been living in the United Kingdom for more than a month had been refused since 1980.
A few years ago, however, it was demonstrated beyond a doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood.
This episode showed us that the precautionary principle applied was meaningful."
In 1999, a much more sensitive technique of HIV testing appeared on the market: nucleic acid (TAN) tests that directly detect the presence of the virus itself and not antibodies against the virus, on which the tests used so far were based.
The NTAs shorten the silent period, which extends between the moment the person was infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
This period could have been reduced to less than a week.
This has substantially reduced the risk that some donors are infected without knowing and cannot be detected.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS through a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of receiving HIV-contaminated blood.
"In other words, it means that 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
As Hema-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will take more than 24 years before a case of transmission of HIV by a blood product occurs.
I believe that today we can feel comfortable receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to recover health," says the head of the Hema-Québec management.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
We never know what pathogen is going to emerge in the system.
Not later that last year appeared on Réunion Island the Chikungunya virus, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
We must be constantly vigilant," Dr. Décary continued before pointing out that in addition to a security supply, Hema-Québec must also provide sufficient supplies.
"The needs are increasing because the population is getting older.
Since anticancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need a refill in red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has consequences on the network of blood donors who on average group only 3% of Quebecers eligible for blood donation."
Any person aged 18 and over who is in health can still give blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14% of those who offer their blood are not accepted, because they are affected by AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have traveled to a country where malaria is plagued, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
"With these 3%, we manage to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
The shortages are very rare.
But members of this donor network must be renewed as they get older and can no longer give their blood.
It is difficult to convince people to give their blood, but above all to hold them back and encourage them to become a regular donor.
Today's life is so frightful, we rarely find the time to spend an hour giving of his blood," says Francine Decary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Québec provides not only blood products but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eye and skin globes that are almost exclusively used for large burned people.
These fabrics are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored at Hema-Québec, which also manages the only public cordon blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was once considered a biomedical waste is filled with blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukaemia.
"We celebrated, a few weeks ago, the banking of our thousandth sample of cordon blood and are expected to take more than a thousand per year.
It should begin to be proposed for transplants at the beginning of next year," says Dr. Decary who describes this cordon blood sampling program as very popular.
"More mothers are disappointed that they can't have access to it", because Hema-Québec does not have the means to propose this complex and costly program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Soccer - The Impact on Half-Final
The Impact of Montreal has qualified for the semi-final round of the elimination series of the first division of the USL, thanks to a win of 3-1 (4-3 total goals) at the Sounders of Seattle, yesterday, at the second and decisive match of the final quarter series to the total goals, at Saputo Stadium.
The terrain medium Antonio Ribeiro marked the decisive goal at the 90th minute of play.
After a first half aimless on one side as on the other, the field environment David Testo and Rocco Plancentino marked the other nets of the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one to play Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Remember that during the first round-back game on Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, in the suburbs of Seattle.
The Impact will be measured at Vancouver Whitecaps in the semifinal.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, Thunder filled a 3-1 deficit in the return game to win it 4-3, but the Whitecaps still reached the 5-4 semifinal round total goals.
The Impact should face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
In brief - Winning goal of Kovalev
The Canadian trio number one is ready to start the season.
The unit composed of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn led the attack in a 3-2 win of the Canadian with dams fired in front of the Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Centre.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the meeting, scored one goal, Plekanec amassed two aids, and Kovalev collected a pass in this gain, the fourth of the Tricolore in six preparatory games.
Kovalev gave the victory by marking the only goal of the shooting.
"I'm not ready yet, the Russian has warned.
I need another game to feel comfortable."
"He tried too much to do in the first period," said Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he liked the end of the game.
He had a nice ovation."
Charest placed on the North
The Prime Minister does not exclude the triggering of elections before the end of the year
When the Liberal Party's general council was finished, Jean Charest went to Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), tried to be elected on the occasion of today's partial election.
"Repulse the limits of our last major northern border": this is the long-term ambition Jean Charest presented with visual force while remaining in the broad lines, at the end of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, a kind of Moulin was projected with images.
They circled, on three huge screens, spectacular clicks of hydroelectric dams, mining operations, Quebec seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Large means, as in the election period.
At the press stage, the Prime Minister refused to rule out that he would trigger the elections this fall, even if he noted that his schedule was very busy.
The "North Plan" is the fourth piece of a "vision" that the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes an agreement on labour force with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches recently, the opening of the North - northern territory at the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, agreed to explain why the North was "a joy to the immense potential", but did not give a deadline, investment amounts, nor a precise priority in future projects.
At most a few avenues of what could be developed further: in particular hydroelectricity, forest, but especially the mining sector, driven by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamond", according to Mr. Charest's list.
This "territorial twice as large as France", "it's at home, it's in Quebec.
Not only is it at home, but it is within us," he insisted, as to show that he was asking for a national myth.
Quebec built a lot in its relationship with the North, he stressed: the gold rush in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
"It's ours, it's our future," he added, after taking a theatrical break to contemplate the immense map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes a portion of the Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, said the Prime Minister at the press point.
"It is a traditional position that all governments have reiterated.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a long time and, when the opportunity arises, I repeat that position on behalf of the government," he said.
In addition, "with climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the North," he said, speaking of the northwest pass, which will open all year round because of the ice source.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that occupying the territory is a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit young people, especially.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pakistani MP of Ungava), have already begun consultations with some thirty communities.
An interdepartmental committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and where Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important place began work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a big meeting, "not necessarily a summit," but a moment when "we will give ourselves a common vision".
North development would be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be "concerted, orderly and environmentally friendly," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as continuing with that of Liberal prime minister who preceded it.
"Like the Liberals who have preceded us, we have thought differently to turn the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was also one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which started on Friday by a great cocktail to highlight the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival at the head of the party.
One of the resolutions proposed to re-baptize the Beauharnois Central in Barrage Adélard-Godbout.
"De Godbout, who created Hydro-Québec, in Lesage who made the Quiet Revolution and the Nationalization of Hydroelectricity, in Bourassa who made James Bay, our party has forged the future," said Jean Charest.
At the press point, he invoked another reference, conservative, the "Roads to the North" program by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
In addressing the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydro-electric dam project, Mr. Charest stressed that its deployment was scheduled for 2012.
"This remains between us, but I plan to be there," he told his militants, raising in their homes applause.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and no doubt in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of polling this fall, which is what the law allows.
He stressed, however, that his schedule was filled, including a mission by the Council of the Federation in China and a Quebec-New York summit.
The General Council of the weekend provided the Liberal leader with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, including "constitutional aspirations" which were passed as a letter to the post: the PLQ calls in particular for recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
He also wished Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission and to have a veto on decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, we welcomed the main lines of the North Plan with skepticism.
The Pakistani leader, Pauline Marois, pointed out the Northern Quebec Development Policy that the Landry Government had launched in 2001.
According to her, the Liberal Government, when it came to power in 2003, gave up its implementation.
If he had done so, "we would be more advanced today" said Mrs. Marois next to her candidate in Jean-Talon (scrutin that takes place today), Françoise Mercure.
The ADC said it supported the adoption of a North Plan by the government.
"But what we want is that it's not just a show," said Sébastien Proulx leader, instead of Mario Dumont, who comes back from vacation today.
Letters - A Dishonored Country
It was Mr. Vic Toews, former minister of the "Justice" (O irony) in Harper's office, who had allowed the last summer to say to Louise Arbour that she was an "honor" for Canada.
Thus cast the reproach on this woman who has led an incessant fight for justice and deserves all our admiration in saying as much about the Prime Minister as about Stephen Harper himself.
We see in front of a government that is the only one, of all the Western countries involved, that we have not returned to the Guantánamo concentration camp.
A government that ignores the fact that Omar Khadr was a young teenager at the time of the facts against him.
The only government that, despite Canada's signing the Geneva Convention, denies its word and lets a child-soldier die in inhuman conditions.
The only one who resorts to a parody of justice to assess the guilt of the accused.
It is recalled that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, inter alia, plead for the repatriation of Omar Khadr to receive a fair trial in Canada.
It is the same government that closes its eyes on torture: it does not matter whether a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, probably forever after so many years of action.
We are not aware of this yet, but we are now witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy", this word that Harper never ceases to brand and that sounds so hollow in his mouth.
Here comes the time when no morals exist no more: we can harm, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen according to the good will of a head of government up to this minority (which will then be after October 14...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that upholds the Truth, the Law and the Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what made our country's reputation and dignity.
The shame, Mr. Toews, is here in this resignation, and not elsewhere.
Libre opinion - Barrick Gold Orwellian Speech
In his September 17 issue, Le Devoir issued a letter from Patrick J. Garver, vice-president of Canadian mining, Barrick Gold.
Pursuing an Orwellian logic, the latter asserts that the world's largest gold company has attempted a defamation of six million against three authors and a small publishing house with no sour in order to launch a "transparent public debate".
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of defamation proceedings, but the law.
Without surprise, this fundamental difference is completely hidden by Mr. Garver.
Because, for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to lead to ruin anyone who dares to support a position contrary to his own?
Whatever the outcome of the trial, the authors and the publisher of the Black Canada book will have to spend considerable amounts to prepare their defence and to fight, with very uneven weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by the almost bottomless pockets of the mine.
Tactical, in these unequal struggles, is often to ruin the defendants in order to impose an amicable settlement that will ban the opposition in addition to frighten anyone who dares to reconsider the matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was in front of public opinion that she should have presented her vision of the facts.
Contrary to what is happening in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, discussions in Canada are normally conducted by exchanging ideas and not by beatings.
It was therefore enough for the mining industry to open its books, dossiers and establish a real debate, through newspapers, the media, publications and funding of independent research teams that could have shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to trust public opinion and rejects the petitions and letters of support to the authors of Black Canada from the back of his hand.
Perhaps Mr. Garver could explain how he could at the same time ask for a "public" debate while ignoring the opinions of the same public?
In the vice-president's world, it seems that this word refers only to paid and not to all Canadians; this is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In democracy, even the detractors have the right to speak.
What does not understand - or doesn't want to understand - Barrick Gold, is that the public who supports the authors and publishers of Black Canada does so primarily because it rejects the brutal way of mining.
This public is willing to hear Barrick and judge, but on the basis of civilized exchanges of arguments, and not in the context of what many perceive as a barbarian prosecution (following the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just filed a settlement at the place of the authors of Black Canada who are trying to stop the use of this term...).
Beyond Mr Garver's surreal speech, the pursuit of Barrick Gold is a direct attack on academic freedom of research and the quest for truth, essential to any democratic society.
It denies, in a block, the right to quote credible sources and the debate on facts and interpretations, which are the very basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss topics that displease rich businesses in this world in a country like Canada, under repeated prosecution, who will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could do so by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Black Canada.
She has a right to reply.
The academic environment, which we belong to, has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
The ongoing pursuit of Barrick Gold clearly shows that, contrary to her claim, she has no desire for a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the academic world, as well as for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place devices limiting this kind of abusive prosecution.
Wall Street Rescue Operation - Democrats and Republicans Agree
The Bush administration and the leaders of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached agreement yesterday on the largest economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the US$700 billion plan aimed at curbing the financial crisis that has been shaking Wall Street for months has yet to be endorsed by the two Houses of Congress.
In particular, it provides: better control by the elected members of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of public money committed, new provisions to contain the number of houses seized for non-payment, as well as a right of consideration on wages paid to the managers of the assisted enterprises.
The US Treasury Secretary, Henry Paulson, President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday at the end of a two-day negotiating marathon.
"We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be effective in the markets," said the representative of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson.
"Everything has been done to protect the real economy and ordinary Americans from the ongoing crisis at Wall Street," the democrat explained.
"This is the fundamental point: if we do not do this, trauma, chaos and disturbances on the daily lives of Americans will be immense," said Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had turned to the sprinkling in the last few hours because of the impact that would cause a further failure on investors' mood.
The deadline was the opening of the markets this morning.
Lately associated with the negotiations, the two candidates for the U.S. presidential election were rather in favour of the agreement, but they did not fail to express their discontent that they were forced to reach this end.
The Democratic Senator Barack Obama has attributed the addition of certain provisions to the agreement, including that to allow owners to keep their homes and the salary of the managers of the state-run enterprises.
"When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there is nothing to congratulate.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on the waves of American television.
Asked about another channel to find out if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, said, "I'd like to see the details, but I hope so."
"The broad lines I have read [show] that this is something we will all have to digest and with which we will be able to move forward.
The option of not doing anything is simply not acceptable," he said.
The 700 billion plan aims to buy with taxpayers' money the suspicious, active and inventable claims of US financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis triggered by the burst of a real estate bubble that first led to the collapse of mortgages at risk (subprime) before extending to other more widespread forms of credit securities (PCAA) and leading to a freeze of liquidity and the breakdown of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of elected Republicans who had brought together the first draft agreement last week.
It is believed to have come out of this deadlock since the Democrats have accepted that some "toxic" assets of companies in difficulty are only insured by the government rather than purchased.
In order to round the angles for everyone in Congress, a provision has also been added that if the government were to incur losses for five years with this program, it could put in place new taxes to help it recover its implementation.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first tranche of $250 billion to be added to another 100 billion if the President deems it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion should be endorsed by another Congress vote.
In exchange for his assistance, Washington will obtain participation in the assisted companies that will pay him dividends in case of profit and that he will be able to resell when the torment is passed.
The federal government will have the opportunity to delay the procedures for seizures of housing related to the real estate loans involved in this plan, as well as to set limits on remuneration and severance allowances paid to the managers of affected enterprises.
The architects of the plan would like to see him put to the vote in the House of Representatives today, and to the House of Representatives on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will have the green light.
In fact, votes continued yesterday against this project, both in the Republican and Democratic camp.
"Of course, Washington doesn't hear you," said Republican Scott Garrett, member of the House's Finance Committee.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one that consists of taking advantage of taxpayers."
Animator of a small group at Congress called "the caucus of skeptics", Democratic representative Brad Sherman presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred eminent economic professors, including three Nobel Prizes, have written us to tell us: we are asking Congress not to press and carefully examine the way forward," he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, we had once again evidence of the global nature of the crisis.
At the end of an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for EUR 11.2 billion (US 16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been made necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas had indicated that it had refused to acquire its competitor in full shipwreck since it lost EUR 2 billion (US 2.9 billion) in the crisis of risky real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and ten largest insurers.
"This is not lost money," said the Dutch Minister of Finance yesterday, Wouter Bos.
In return, a right to vote in the bank and influence is recovered.
It's just something that savers and households now appreciate that times are telling themselves uncertain."
Meanwhile, on the other side of the Channel, the British government seemed to be in the process of nationalizing another bank damaged by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take into account all current loans at Bradford and Bringley Bank, of which more than 41 billion (75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would purchase the branches and accounts of the British bank.
The Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after the Northern Rock, that the British government should nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of an engaged icon
Its beauty in the eyes of azur was long its asset map, some of them will say its weakness.
Had he been released from the narcissistic mirror, the American actor with the charming smile?
Yes and no.
Its stinking, sensitiveness and talent flowing from the source will also have taken it away from the register of power that fills the true sacred monsters.
But what a great runner!
Paul Newman, who disappeared on Friday, at 83 years of age, from lung cancer in his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last icons of American cinema in the early years.
Less monumental than Brando, to whom he resembled and whose for a long time he was a kind of opponent to the screen, more cautious in his game, certainly more fragile, but also apostolate of the freedom and the outburst of the dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often makes beautiful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, from a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
No demesured ego, ultimate quality brand.
For he planned an entire country of the self-made man, from the Pacific War fighter, wounded in combat, who in the early 1950s studied dramatic art in Yale and then attended the Actor's Studio in New York, before triumphing at the theatre, on television, soon at the cinema.
The same man who fought for civic rights was also the motorist who ranked second at 24 hours from the Mans in 1979, doubled with a sex symbol, although a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
The shadow zones of this secret star, discreet, engaged, allergic to the sparks of the show-business, with which the enigma will not be fully pierced, also disappear with him.
An honest man, in the noblest sense of the term.
Paul Newman's disappearance provided vertigo to the cinemaphiles this weekend, as his great roles on the black screen of memories are intertwined.
More than half a century of a seventh American art in perpetual parade mutation through it.
Resurrected in memory of Butch Cassidy's charming cowboy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man rejecting his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in La Chatte on a suitably hot roof of Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), his sensitive Mr. Bridge is mentioned, troubled in his old age by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
So many other Paul Newmans have gone to history.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Lukes Me (Marked by Hate), by Robert Wise, a role destined to James Dean, resumed after his death, which really launched Newman in 1956.
This friendly evil in the brilliant The Sting (L'Arnaque), Oscar of the best film in 1973.
A bitter and vengeful billiard player in Robert Rossen's beautiful The Hustler (1961), he will resume his character on the return to Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which in 1987 earned him his only Oscar on nine appointments.
This face across the ages, it was him.
Him again.
The eras flow through its course.
Young people are particularly familiar with the cultured Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen Brothers.
With a last role as a sponsor of the Irish Mafia in Road to Losing Sam Mendes in 2003, the loop was blocked.
In the face of several film legends that soon left the trade, Newman will remain on the saddle for a long time while denouncing Hollywood, its gold, its bands and its concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered it, not without humor, "as a living challenge to "underplaying" judging its benefits too supported.
The profession has not always been tender for the beautiful Paul Newman to whom roles take all cooked in the beak for a long time.
However, he played less often among young people than the marginals: neuroses, alcoholics, bastards or desperate, whose perfect traits reflected the drifts and revolts.
As a director, Newman revealed ill-known facets of his true pudical sensitivity.
His Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (according to the novel of Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the main role, drew an end to the female portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott by overdose dedicated his film Harry and Son to him in 1984, a work of rot and sadness.
Among the rain of tributes that was pouring on Newman yesterday, his great friend and former gun companion Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, very attracted: "His presence has made my life and this country better."
Generosity, love of existence are vibrant traits of the missing actor.
Beyond his legendary career, he is also a great activist for civic rights, ecology, independent cinema, a challenger of Hollywood's drifts.
We've seen a lot of his goodies jogging on pots of vinegar, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging the process of pretty bad taste, though gag at first.
The profits of these sales were, however, paid to its Children's Foundation in difficulty.
Newman, rather than sitting on his myth, will be committed to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these phrases: "Every day and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there."
And a privilege for us to have followed the course of such a lucid and generous American artist.
Model citizen, in sum and sus.
What could make Zushlag &amp; Company in their billing plant?
On 8 October, hearings will begin in connection with the ongoing criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his accomplices.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of fraud, in the form of a criminal organization, permanently and on a regular basis, resulting in particularly significant damage, and other charges have been held against them, such as false and false.
According to the prosecutor's office, the money from subsidies was spent for personal purposes, while the benefits were justified by false invoices.
The money from the state and the municipalities, about HUF 65 million in total, went on the one hand to the banks of the Fiatal Balldal movement and on the other hand, to the pocket of some people.
Their method, also made public by the investigating authorities, was to pay the money from the subsidies obtained by issuing invoices of fees, behind which no actual benefits were provided and thus, associations never complied with their commitments.
According to the indictment, a large part of the invoices were false.
For the latter, they were looking for invoice books at the Józsefváros market, while they made the caches in Kiskunhalas.
For the names of companies that were to be included on the invoices, it was decided, among other things, during the northern tours of Lake Balaton, made by István Lados, at the request of János Zuschlag.
According to the latter's statement, he was required to locate pensions and restaurants.
For his personal consumption, he asked for an invoice, on which model they made the other invoices they were going to introduce, inter alia, to the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the Municipality of Capital for access to grants.
The majority of the invoices were created by István Lados and his partner András, who, according to our information, was mainly concerned with writing the files needed to obtain the subsidies.
During a "research circuit", one of Lados' choice was a bistro.
According to the two invoices issued by the Zuschlag in 2003, this place ensured the restoration of a group of 90 people, members of the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
However, according to the manager, it would have been impossible for so many people to occupy this place at the same time.
In the same way, in the summer of 2002, the invoice established on behalf of the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, which will subsequently be known as Együtt a Harmadik Évesredert, ransacked of faults of form and substance.
A pension, located in Badacsonytomaj, actually had only three rooms, and up to ten people could spend the night there. However, the invoice mentioned 100 customers.
In their accounts, the name Jobb Jövőért or the name of Hoppá did not appear, according to information given to the prosecutor's office.
Győző Farkas, the manager of the company, told hvg.hu that when the prosecutor summoned him and showed him the invoices, he knew immediately that it was false documents.
"The name of our company and our tax number were placed in a bad place on the cache."
He added: "In addition to the form, the fact that according to the invoice, a hundred people had stayed there did not collate either, since this establishment has only eleven rooms, which do not have as much place.
In addition, the invoice also mentions meals, and our restaurant has been closed for a long time."
Zealous invoice issuers have also not been informed about the travel agencies in Budapest, being part of their choice, but only organizing travel abroad. Thus, they have naïvely reported stays in Hungary on cash bills, which also goes against the agency's accounting practices.
Surprisingly, as appeared during the investigation, they also added VAT on these documents, while the travel services, the destination of which is outside the European Union, are charged without VAT.
Similarly, the VAT rate of the four invoices established on behalf of the Revfülöp Hotel in the order of Jobb Jövőert was incorrect, since the company's benefits do not bear a 25% VAT as indicated, but a 15% VAT. Moreover, the hotel employees only issue printed invoices, while the falses were handwritten.
The prosecutor's investigation revealed that "emitters" also made mistakes by mentioning as a service the transport of goods by road, that the issuing company of invoices could not exercise, since its profile was the investment council.
Moreover, it is also for vice versa of forms, such as inappropriate invoice types and false caches, that invoices issued in the order of Együtt a Harmadik Évesredert Alapitvány, XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont have proved false.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or Kunfehertó's sports internship, which both deny to be the authors of invoices issued on their behalf.
The fact that HIB Kft., established in Nyíregyháza, was in liquidation was also ignored by the fact that (in 2001) the Fiatal Városért Egyesület group was supposed to have a meal at their home. According to our information, that is why the liquidator of the company did not issue the invoice.
Deliberate proceedings
Another category of invoice issuers was that of those who were fully aware that they were asked to issue fictional invoices.
The Foundation Esély Budapestért Alapitvány, at the request of the group of Fiatal Balldal - Ifjú Szocialistták, has established an invoice in the order of the foundation Együtt a Harmadik Évesredert, for a sum of four million HUFs.
According to the indictment, the manager of Collab Kft. was forced to issue false invoices by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi.
Similarly, it cooperated with the Zuschlags, the company Biogate Kft., which is currently under liquidation and which in 2003 issued invoices to the order of the Jobb Jövőért Alapitvány Foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület Association and the association Vörösfenyő Egyesület, for an amount of approximately five million HUF, but behind which no service was actually provided.
No financial movement has taken place, either since the invoices issued have subsequently been cancelled, but this has prevented organizations from mentioning it in their accounts.
The following category of companies issuing invoices is that of companies directly related to the accused.
For example, the administrative delegate of the Director General of Delta Trió Kft., dealing with the trade in fuel and motor vehicles, whose head office was in Budapest, but where it could be found, was Ivan Kubatov.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices for the sale of computer equipment, amounting to approximately HUF 18 million.
According to the investigation, these equipment would have been purchased by the Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which had been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The director of the company was a Romanian-born man, whom Ivan Kubatov would also have provided documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005.
According to what we know, Kubatov recognized during the investigation that he issued invoices at the order of Atlasz, Hoppá and Együtt companies at Harmadik Évesredert Alapitvány, and that he charged their value.
It was precisely at the request of Ivan Kubatov that Romanian masons created Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In fact, none of these companies worked, which the accused explained because they did not receive work.
He also used these companies, since at the request of Master Zsolt Szente, co-accused and editor of the founding acts of companies, he made invoices to their names, to the order of associations relating to Zuschlag, such as the Atlasz and Y-Generació associations.
Kubatov gave organizations, 15 total invoices, issued by Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, for a value of HUF 14.2 million.
The parquet thought that 10% of the amounts indicated on the invoices and VAT were in Kubatov's pocket.
The man even used the company Szi-Beri Bt. to establish fictional invoices that were used as part of the Biztos Pont grant application.
In January 2006, the Association Y-Genéració and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországert introduced a grant application to the public utility organization of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapitvány (TMA).
They obtained this grant twice as much as 500,000 HUF, but those amounts were not used for the objectives indicated in the application.
To prevent this from becoming known, five fictional invoices received from the Works Team Kft. were submitted to the TMA.
In fact, these invoices were found during the search of the Kemecsei Árpád office in the Ministry of Education.
At the hearing, some of the accused will report the method of making invoices, as she had already done before the prosecutor's office.
What could be really interesting would be that the principal accused, János Zuschlag himself, decides to lift the veil over all history.
So far, his confessions are not very detailed, and although he has promised several times to tell the least details, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest, or whether, if any, the socialists would have concluded an agreement that in exchange for the reimbursement of a large part of the HUF fifty million, Zusi would bear only the hat.
Today, the latter is probably vexed, since the applications for his placement in a supervised residence, based on a relief from his conditions of detention, are constantly falling in the ear of a deaf person.
While those who have caused much greater damage, and the perpetrators of non-repairable economic crimes, walk freely or at least, await their own home the end of the procedure. He does not have this possibility.
The psychology of over-heating: why do we spend more money?
In auction sales, buyers tend to spend more, and overestimate the goods.
The New York University's neurology and economic researchers have been able to update the neurological and economic basis for this apparently irrational behaviour.
According to their study published in the journal Science, human beings do not want to be distanced from this type of competition, such as auction sales on eBay, and that is why they prefer even to pay too high a price.
These researches attempted to develop a neurological pattern of this kind of "game" using experimental auction sales.
One of the volunteer groups played the loto, while the other group took part in a playful auction, while using a functional magnetic resonance imaging process (MRI), researchers analyzed the active brain domains of experimental subjects.
In both games, participants could earn money, but during the auction sale, a key element of which is the over auction of a third, the whole of which was under the brain stem, called striatum, was placed in intensive motion during the loss of the party.
This part of the brain, alongside several other functions, plays a role in the "self-stimulation" mechanism of the nervous system.
This is why, according to researchers, the rise in prices is explained by the flight to the violent reaction of striatum.
In support of their theories, the economists of this group of researchers continued financial monitoring analyses.
At the same time, three groups were overindulging against a partner in various circumstances.
They simply informed the control group of the actual value of the product in question, and thus carried out their assessment.
To another group, they promised that if, in addition, they were winning the party, then they would receive an additional $15, in reward.
While the third group received these $15 before the auction, the members of the group also lost that money, if they lost the auctions.
The difference between these two groups is in fact that the focus was on victory, while the other was on failure.
By thus proving the hypothesis of neurologists, members of the player team "against failure" were willing to put higher than those performed by the control group and the "for victory" group.
"These results cannot be demonstrated by any existing economic theory.
In fact, each of them explained the phenomena found during auctions only by the pleasure of winning and the parade in front of the risk.
Only neurologic imaging methods have helped to remove the contradiction between the two theories, now resulting in a third explanation." - Andrew Schotter, Professor of the Faculty of Economic Sciences at the University of New York, found.
Hepatitis: When should we consult a doctor?
In the world, about half a billion people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary, chronic liver disease is mentioned among the first causes of death.
It is estimated that the diseased carriers of the hepatitis virus in Hungary are estimated to be 100 miles, but only seven miles are being treated, which is because the patients often do not know that they are carrying the virus.
Hepatitis name is a generic name given to infections affecting the liver and caused by different viruses.
There are many similarities between their symptoms. Inflammation of the liver and yellowish are characteristic, but pathogens and diseases generated differ from one another.
Hepatitis viruses, according to pathogenic genes, propagate mainly in two forms: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tube (e.g. food or contaminated water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses by blood and organic liquids (sperm, vaginal secretion, saliva).
For travellers, vaccination against A and B viruses is recommended in any way. There is no vaccine against C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after the consumption of contaminated foods, in general, accompanied by poor general condition, weakness, stomach disease and nausea.
Then it develops on the skin and on the white eye a visible yellow, the soles become clearer and the urine takes a darker color. The healing can take two to three weeks.
Around the world, every year, one million people die of the most severe form of this pathology, such as liver cancer or cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main cause is that, according to estimates, only one in ten patients receive medical treatment.
Hepatitis C may also have serious consequences: if it is not treated, it may lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most patients do not know how to reach the virus, because the pathogen gene destroys the liver cells in a sneezing way. In many cases, the first symptoms only appear after 20 to 30 years.
Therefore, early prevention is very important, as well as regular screening tests.
Contamination is much higher than the average among a population of three groups: people who had suffered from a blood transfusion prior to 1991, drug users and tattoos.
Currently, 200 million patients with chronic type C hepatitis are found worldwide.
Since the disease can be detected by a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to consult your doctor who treats you as soon as you observe symptoms of unknown origin.
The disease can be cured if it is detected in time. The virus can be eradicated from the body, thus the risk of contagion disappears and the development of cancer is prevented.
September 30 is the world day of hepatitis, first organized in 2004 by the organizations representing the sick from around the world.
Its objective is to draw attention to the cirrhosis of the chronic liver caused by viruses, the causes of its development and the importance of early diagnosis of the disease.
Does the one who grows up in God feel less pain?
According to the results of a recent research, religious belief would function as a sort of analgesic, which would have already contributed to making the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
The British newspaper Telegraph published an article that researchers at Oxford University had an interesting experience analyzing how belief in God could influence tolerance to the pain of human beings.
As part of this experience for the least odd, 12 Catholic believers and as many atheists were subjected to electroshocks, while each of them observed a painting representing the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude much of suffering.
Through a technique of palpation of the human brain, it was also discovered that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain responsible for the regulation of pain.
This analysis is the first of a series of experiences, with academics, scholars, philosophers and theologians participating from different sectors of the university.
Specifically, the experience takes place in the following way: an instrument emitting sparks and spreading electroshocks is fixed on the left hand of the experimental subject.
The researchers asked the participants of the experience to look at two paintings in a sustained manner, one being the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and the other, the Lady to Hermine painted by Léonard de Vinci in the 15th century.
The researchers behind this experience hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary would evoke a kind of state of faith among believers, while the choice of Da Vinci's painting, not very different from the first, was concerned with its soothing effect.
Experimental subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and during that time they received 20 electroshocks in four succeeding parts, while looking at either the religious theme painting or the more general theme one.
Catholics said that in the eyes of the Virgin Mary, they felt like "safe", as someone who "takes care" and they "quieted, and peace invaded them".
In view of the painting of a religious theme, they reported 12% of pain in less than when they looked at Léonard's work.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who himself took part in the experiment, thinks that we can achieve the same effects with any other strong image, in atheists, provided we find the appropriate photo.
"We should find an image in front of which they react very positively, such as a mother or father," said the psychologist.
Tom Wright, Anglican bishop, welcomed the results of this research.
"The practice of faith should change, and in many cases, it does change our personality," Wright added.
After these excellent results, is there no longer the question of what would be the effect on the regulation of subject pain if believers were to show a Madonna painted by Léonard or a painter of the same caliber?
Would the view of a better quality Virgin Mary produce better results?
You're what you're telling me about yourself.
On the occasion of its tenth anniversary, Google states that it can be found at the bottom of the pocket of people in the same way as the sky over their heads. He knows where they spent their holidays, which specialists they consult and which are their centres of interest.
However, it is not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, who is one of the influential people of society.
While with regard to skeptics setting a parallel with Orwell's horror vision, they do not see the core of web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently stated in the Financial Times that Google's main ambition is to gather even more information about its users. This is necessary so that Google's founders can meet their original goal which sounded as follows: "We collect all the information from the world in a system!".
According to Google's leader, after ten years of a world-wide work, they are still only at the beginning of their goals of being able to process all the information.
To the question: What will there be in five years? Schmidt replied that he would like Google to be able to answer questions like "What can I do tomorrow?" or "What work would I do best?". However, software will not be able to answer this kind of question, simple at first sight, until the day they know enough about users.
It is not perfectly clear for all netizens that the words used during Internet searches, the IP address of the computer that launches the search and the pages subsequently consulted by the interested persons are specifically listed.
Through the Custom Search program launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own research history and consult what they looked for, on which they clicked. By this, in the long term, Recommendations, Program based on the same logic, will be able to give much more personalized answers, and will submit products and services based on our previous statements and registered preferences.
What happens if someone uses my data against me, if he looks at what my job is? ask users, who are worried about Google's monopoly of information.
In most cases, it is the potential power represented by society that can stir up fear, and it is not the remorse, the fear of punishment, the desire for freedom or possibly the revolt against power that can provoke counter-reaction among netizens.
However, it is confirmed that the terms sought are not only recorded, but in justified cases they are passed on to a third party, and in such legal cases nothing protects the personal rights of netizens.
The most striking example of recent times is probably the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google transmitted to the Brazilian government the information it had collected on the public page called Orkut, thus allowing identification.
Human rights-responsive netizens were able to raise a sigh of relief last May, when Google, with the EFF electronic legal protection agency below, proved its right to the court in the face of the FBI. According to the judgment given in the future, Google will still not be obliged by any of the points of the constitution to disclose information on the FBI's secret request, of any kind.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully obtained some 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 research terms it had won in relation to the strengthening of the Child Protection Act, voted several years before. But ultimately, it did not succeed in obtaining the lists of searches of private users, nor the full list of websites and keywords of the last two months.)
Thus, Google's judgment is quite contradictory: it is flogged by those who fear the transmission of their personal data, because they think that their private sphere and private domain suffer from it when they begin to use Google services. Therefore, they attack them in the spirit of revolt that is manifested against multinational corporations proud of their conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its "sauvageons" bringing together the enthusiasts, activists and enthusiastic users of the computer that appear in many countries see in Google the next generation of big companies, the "connected corporation", as opposed to its rival, Microsoft, catalogued as an invader of the world because of Windows, and this, even though both are fighting for the same goal.
This can be explained by the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its identification code users, does not ask for money for its applications. The documentary code and the program package, continuously cooled, has a much more accessible, younger and cooler effect, compared to the practice of the official software giant.
The reason may also be that the geeks see very exactly the problematic relationship between human rights and the internet, and what web 2.0, the most proclaimed keyword in recent years, draws right behind it.
Indeed, web 2.0 concerns nothing other than collaboration, than the fact that we intentionally leave traces behind us, and that we use channels of communication at our disposal, and while the dimension of these changes one by one, the main thing remains the same: we are exposed.
A young man, in general, can hold a profile on several public pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and he can even link these to other benefits, such as Twinter, or last.fm, listing his musical habits. Then he can link them to a prosecution system, such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. These young people can also hold blogs, in which they automatically show up their latest photo galleries that they store on Flickr or on Picasa.
While you can see many examples, such as that of the girlfriend who easily understands the morning photos, taken by the circle of common friends, with whom his unfaithful friend spent the evening, or that of the society that fired one of his employees, nothing but for the sincere opinions that he wrote on his blog about top management, we can be on one thing: the term of private life is totally to be reconsidered today.
He who lives online is made up of what he shows himself, and that is how the principle can be defined by hiding behind the behaviour of today's youth.
He wants to hide something, or at least, he wants to try to bypass Google's monopoly, he can do it (starting, for example, with Scroogle, using the Google search system, but at the same time, he doesn't intentionally leave any trace).
The number of people who deliberately do not register on public pages so that it is not possible to find them, is not fewer. Google's services online, through the processing of text to image processing, can be replaced by alternative versions, which are not linked to huge parks of servers and that do not combine our best profile, having so far existed.
Public opinion awaits, without truly hiding, the moment when Google will reveal its true nature.
The company, with its current value of $156 billion, is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion). AdWords/AdSense advertising areas threaten the turnover of advertising agencies, while benefits introduced at an ever-increasing rate lead to serious migration not only to Microsoft, but to many other IT program creators.
However, critical observers find, in addition to all this, contradictions with worrying effects: for example, the top management of the company has rejected, in its entirety, the protests of employees, after it has doubled the price of the employer's maternity and after the company has considered the daily multiple restoration too costly, taken at any time. All this seems to be hilarious alongside the fact that already in 2006, Google has acquired before the Chinese government and according to the terms of their agreement, the company detects all the results that hurt the good taste, as well as the interests of the Chinese regime.
According to one of the internal rules of society, new services are not announced only when they can be used. What is on, it is that in the coming months and years, they will move the world on new points. While some think that Google's book and magazine scan and archiving project takes such important dimensions that the company will soon find itself facing the United States Supreme Court, others tremble in front of its health system, because in it we can build a complete medical profit from our results of previous analyses, our doctors and our problems.
The fact that Google sets up a genetic database can give good raw material to the next generation of science fiction authors. The novel of the famous Cory Doctorow, written with half-ton Orwellians, describes the future in which a man could be approached in a baffling way only through Google's data.
Two juveniles helped to make the double homicide of Ozd disappear
"The police summoned two minors to interrogate them in the case of Ozd's double homicide. According to well-founded suspicions, they helped to make the traces of the crime disappear." - said the spokesperson of the Borsod department.
The young have recognized the facts that have been brought against them, and for the time being, they are accused of complicity.
The two minors, who, according to information from MTI (Hurroise Telegraphic Agency) are girls, defend themselves freely.
The complicity of murder may result in detention of up to 5 years.
The suspect of the double homicide of Ozd, a young man from 23 years of age, was placed in pre-trial detention on Sunday.
The charges against him are multiple homicides, committed with premeditation and interest.
During the investigation, it turned out that the 23-year-old boy owed a large sum of money to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to settle his debt, and that's why he attracted his creditor, last Wednesday, to a site in Ozd where he killed him, as well as that man's 9-year-old girl.
According to information from the MTI, the young man premeditated his crime. The weapon with which he was going to commit his hidden crimes at the crime scene is proof of this.
The police examine the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the help of specialists.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange makes a proposal for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw stock exchange offered two hundred million euros, about five billion Czech krona, to buy 100% of the stock package from the Prague stock exchange.
Ludwik Sobolowski, the president of the Warsaw stock exchange, confirmed this proposal that the Polish made despite the fact that the Czechs had previously excluded the Warsaw stock exchange from the new potential owners of the Prague stock exchange.
The reason for this exclusion is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state who wishes to separate from more than 60% of its shares in a few months of activity.
According to the Czech economic newspaper E15, the Polish proposal represents the highest offer that has so far been made for the purchase of the Prague stock exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna stock exchange, the Nasdaq transatlantic stock exchange, the Stock Exchange in New York, the London stock exchange and the Deutsche Börse have made an offer so far.
Petr Koblic, the director of the Prague Fellowship, said last week that among the interested, the Warsaw Fellowship would be the least good owner, and did not exclude the fact that this could lead to the disappearance of the Prague Fellowship in the future.
The value of the Prague stock exchange is estimated from 5 to 10 billion Czech crowns by market specialists.
On the basis of an agreement between shareholders, some 90% of the papers would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague stock exchange is the Patria Finance investment bank, with about 25 percent of the stakes, followed by the 14.7 percent of the Ceská Sporitelna bank and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the European press's point of view
In their comments on Tuesday on the international financial crisis, increasing from day to day, European press leaders already refer to a "second September 11".
"The global financial disaster, we owe it to the US president" - accuses the daily of Rome, La Repubblica. "The president was not even able to block with his own party behind a bill, improvised to va-vite, aimed at helping a desperate situation..."
Instead of a new Pearl Harbour, as referred to by billionaire Warren Buffett, it is more appropriate to speak of a second September 11th.
Part of the Madrid press also sees the scapegoat in Washington.
According to the El Mundo daily vision, it was the lack of political leadership there that brought the world economy to the brink of collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the U.S. financial system is growing every day, and eventually the whole world is going to pay the high price.
Bush's plan was far from perfect, however, according to the Congress's vote, a real danger, the one Washington does not propose as a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy hangs in the void, just when in the history of capitalism, one of the greatest transformations takes place.
We cannot ignore the threat any longer - the Geneva Tages-Anzeiger points out.
Some states may still carry a lifeboat to their titubant financial institutions, and thanks to the money of their taxpayers, they can save them from bankruptcy.
Of course, if even more banks collapse like dominoes, then neither financial resources nor new improvisations will be sufficient.
In the long term, we need the European Union's states to make little of their national selfishness, and to centralize control over divided financial markets.
Only Monday, weak financial institutions have received more than 100 billion euros - recalled the Viennese daily, Der Standard, which adds that the fears that European taxpayers too will have to put their hands to the pocket, very deep, similar to the Americans in order to remedy the crisis, become increasingly realistic.
So far, the EU has not really dealt with the crisis, which, like a tsunami, crosses the old continent, on the one hand.
The "savior" must not immediately raise EUR 100 billion, but it would be wise if they noted in what case it would be rational to reach taxpayers' money, with the objective of preventing further damage.
Smart car imitates bourdon's flight
What method would be better for developing technologies capable of avoiding an obstacle, if not the imitation of an existing obstacle detector already in nature?
Like, for example, the bees' one.
In the surprising project presented at CEATEC, which took place in Japan, bourdonating bees gave the strategic idea of departure to the engineers of Nissan, to inspire them on how they should design the next generation of obstacle detectors.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan built a mini robot car, a bio-inspired self-robotized control system, type BR23C, that he equipped bees' qualities, with the ultimate goal of encouraging the development of a system that can avoid all obstacles.
During its flights, each bee constitutes its own space, oval form, which actually resembles a lot of our secure protective hull - explained, during the exhibition, Kazuhhiro Doi, the director of the research and development department and technological public relations of the brand.
The bee facet eye plays an essential role, as it is able to see in all directions, at an angle of 300 degrees.
To imitate the functions of the facet eye, engineers approached the idea of the laser telemeter.
It identifies the obstacles in an angle of 180 degrees and a distance of 2 meters in front of the BR23C, assesses the distances and sends a signal to the microprocessor, which transforms it into an avoidance maneuver immediately.
The perception of the obstacle takes place in a fraction of a second. Then, the mini robot, mimicking the movements of the bee, immediately changes the direction of its wheels by turning it from an angle enough to avoid collision.
Unlike any existing system, this avoidance manoeuvre is carried out entirely instinctively.
"If that wasn't the case, the mini robot couldn't react quickly enough to avoid the obstacle," says Toshiyuki Andoh, the director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robotic car project.
It must react instinctively and instantaneously, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and inner layer of the protective envelope, a layer where the collision is currently considered inevitable.
This whole process must reflect what bee does to avoid other bees.
The process must take place in a blink of an eye.
Unlike bees, the difference cannot go up, down or diagonally, it can only be of two dimensions, and only in the direction in which the wheels can turn.
In this way, instead of the infinite combinations that the bees possess to avoid the other bees, in our case, it was only possible to use the rotational movement, acceleration and slowdown as maneuvers at the disposal of the mini robot
The BR23C uses Lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and whose energy concentration is higher, making their life span longer than in the Lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, it is the instinctive smart reaction that is paramount, not data processing, and even less the capacity to store.
This mechanism should treat only a few incoming signals per second, and respond to them.
It is not necessary to store them and react with intuitive logic based on data from previous manoeuvres. In this way, it uses only a few dozen kilo-bytes of memory continuously.
There is no need for memory of a giga-bytes capacity, not even mega-bytes.
This is the first step towards the design of a technology for instant avoidance. Nissan's estimates show that this system will make its entry into the cars manufactured in series in the next ten years.
Another application could be its incorporation into the GPS satellite navigation system so that it can guide the driver to his destination by avoiding obstacles on his way.
We even gave the baby a name out of price
The written version of the $700 billion economic rescue plan, which aims to redeem the bank's doubtful credits, and to use several times, is ready.
In the first round, half of that amount will be spent.
Reuters announces that in the course of further discussions until after midnight, Saturday, local time on the east coast, Congressional leaders have come to agree on existing disputes for days and days around the $700 billion rescue plan.
"We have made a serious step forward," said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic President of the American House of Representatives, according to which there is no more than to put the agreements on paper.
The compromise, born from the plan, is supported by the two presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
The US Treasury Secretary, Henry Paulson, said by commenting on the results of the compromise that the program will work and will be effective, but other measures still need to be implemented. According to Pelosi, there is no question here of saving Wall Street, but of turning the wheels of the economy in the other direction.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of Asian markets on Sunday evening at 8:00 p.m., Washington's local time (i.e. Monday at 2:00 p.m., depending on Central European local time), but did not cause spectacular rise in scholarships.
Monday, the House of Representatives will be the first to vote on the bill to be submitted on behalf of the 2008 Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, and then its fate will be in the hands of the Senate.
On Saturday evening, President George W. Bush spoke to Pelossi, and then the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement.
"We are pleased with the progress achieved this night, and we appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and to protect our economy," said Tony Fratto, the spokesman for the White House.
In addition, the program diverges from the original proposal made by the Bush administration, which it mentioned that the $700 billion needed to be spent at one time, in order to buy the securities on questionable credits.
In future, up to half of the 700 billion amount can be spent. The first 250 billion will be issued immediately after the adoption of the law by Congress, probably Monday. This first amount will be used by the Treasury Secretary to buy suspicious bank receivables, while the use of the additional $100 billion will be left to the President's discretion.
The programme will be supervised by an independent body, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The spending of the second half of the 700 billion depends on a new Congress decree.
According to the Act, the Treasury secretariat will be able to implement a combined strategy: at the same time, it will be able to purchase suspicious claims, mortgages and suspicious mortgages, as well as other types of "toxic" claims.
The department's competent individuals have stated that purchases can be made through a auction sale, but also directly.
The rule gives the companies concerned the opportunity to participate in an insurance program, where the Treasury secretariat guarantees tools at the root of concerns, for which companies have paid an equivalent premium for foreseeable damage.
Henry Paulson stated that the law provides the necessary tools to dedicate $700 billion to the urgent needs of the financial system, whether it is the vast purchase of suspicious claims, their insurance, or to avoid the risk of seeing the system resulting from the collapse of any major financial institution.
"We will take the necessary steps, to be ready to apply the law, as soon as it is signed," he added.
On the other hand, bank leaders who are in bad postures and waiting for state aid can expect that their starting allowances, simply called an overseas gold parachute, will be capped by the government.
The salary cap is mentioned only in very specific cases. Furthermore, the limitations depend on how the Treasury secretariat proposes its assistance to the company.
The principle of cap means that if the Treasury secretariat buys in a auction sale, they will collect an excess of tax on the golden parachute unless the Bank President discredited retires.
Directly after the acquisition of suspicious claims, the government will act aggressively to ensure that the amount paid to the leaders is not overstated.
For the image to be complete, it must still be added that the existing golden parachutes are not modified. The ceiling concerns only the new contracts, thus motivating participation in the plan.
This is the first time in the history of the United States that legal ceilings will be in force with regard to the additions of the Directors General - commented the Chairman of the Committee in charge of the financial benefits of the House of Deputies, Democratic Barney Frank.
In addition, the State seeks a right of acquisition of shares in banks taking part in the plan, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, as they can even be won in the case as soon as the economy and with it the banks saved will fall on their feet.
The bill states that in the next five years, the President must introduce a proposal to Congress that will determine how the losses will be returned to taxpayers, from the financial sector.
On both sides, there were, of course, those who expressed doubts about this plan.
This is not why American citizens have sent us, this does not protect taxpayers' dollars - said the Republican MP of California, Darrell Issa.
His Democratic colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, believes that they are the same ones who are pressing for action, as those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

The higher prices of plastic and chemical raw materials resulted in a considerable monthly increase in prices in the manufacturing sector of chemicals (1.6 per cent).
Deflation resulted in oil processing (1.4 per cent), the manufacture of machinery and electrical equipment (0.9 per cent), as well as a minimal increase in wood processing (0.1 per cent).
The prices of paper production, publishing and printing have not changed.
The other sectors of the processing industry increased from 0.2% to 0.9%.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors, which are important in national industrial operations, prices increased by 0.3 per cent in August, mainly due to the effect of the increase in the gas price introduced by the authorities since 1 July.
In a comparison of 12 months, taking into account the domestic sale of the processing sectors, the most significant increase in the oil processing sector was the price of 32.4 per cent.
In the metal manufacturing sector, a 13.2 per cent increase in prices was observed, while in the important area of food, beverages and tobacco production, prices increased by 11 per cent.
Price reductions were made in the textile and textile production sectors (2.5 per cent), as well as in the manufacture of electrical machinery and appliances (0.3 per cent).
In the other sectors of the processing industry, price increases have increased from 0.6% to 9.1%.
Throughout the processing industry, prices increased by 10.2 per cent over the past year.

Next year, will we still need a visa to go to the United States?
Kinga Göncz believes that there is a good chance that, by January 12, the American-Hungarian visa-free agreement will enter into force. This is what the Minister of Foreign Affairs has declared in Chicago before the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
According to her, "currently, everything depends only on the time when the overseas electronic systems of entry and control will be put into service."
At times, she drew attention to the fact that in the new system there will be no entry visa, but tourists will have to register before departure.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy will be in negotiations from today's in Washington.
He will meet with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Condoleezza Rice, to whom he will give the decoration of the Commander Cross with the Order of Merit Star of the Republic of Hungary, and will have an interview with the foreign policy advisers of the candidates for the presidency, Democratic Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain both support the bank rescue plan
On Sunday, Barack Obama, as well as John McCain, the candidates for the presidency of the two major American parties, have assured their support of the $700 billion government rescue plan. However, there are politicians who demand the resignation of the U.S. Secretary to the Treasury.
After marathon negotiations that lasted days and days, the representatives of Congress and the Administration finally announced, on Sunday at dawn, that they had entered into agreements in principle on the bank's rescue plan.
This funding plan, with the aim of clearing the Wall Street crisis and the paralyzed credit market, became the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain even present themselves, each as more suitable than the other, to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the latest polls, with the emphasis on economic issues, Obama has again managed to get himself a little ahead of it. McCain's advance, obtained with Sarah Palin's appointment as a collist just after the Republican convention, has melted.
At a campaign meeting held in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that the Congress would quickly vote on the 700 billion rescue bill.
He stressed that the proposal contained the consumer protection passages that he also supported.
"It is now necessary to act, with responsibility (...) a threat to your work, your economies, the entire industrial sectors and the stability of the whole economy" - he said to a crowd of 35,000 people.
There was no shortage of qualifying McCain's economic ideas for excesses.
In an interview given to the ABC chain, McCain said: "We will all have trouble swallowing it (...) but nothing to do is a possible path."
The Republican Senator stated that in the proposal, the creation of a Treasury Control Board and the capping of the departure allowances of senior officials were mentioned, and he was personally very attached to these points.
Obama told the CBS that McCain had no substantive role in the negotiations, while he was in daily contact with the Treasury Secretary.
Nancy Pelosi, President of the House of Representatives, said Sunday that there is serious hope that the House will vote on the bill on Monday.
The press review of the German language territory
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only at the heart of the party that the voters have become more conscious - as well as the Der Spiegel, the low score of the CSU in the Bavarian country.
Haider is ready to govern Austria, to prevent the coalition of reds and blacks.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the Internet edition of the German left-wing information magazine, Franz Walter analyzes the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article entitled "The Bavarian Revolution devours its fathers".
According to this recognized political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber took office.
Christian socialists have transformed Bavaria for decades and now it is these same modern citizens who turn their backs on them.
This change of time is at the same time the problem of all Christian democracy, and therefore also that of Angela Merker.
For the CSU, failure was not quite a surprise, but on Sunday, a process came to an end that was likely ten years ago: the indisputable hegemony of the national party has ended.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU gathered 47.7 per cent, for the first time since the 1950s, with a score below the 50 per cent level.
This was repeated three years ago during the 2005 Bundestag elections, i.e. at the time of the so-called Stoiber.
The cause may be imputed to the modernization "devoting its parents", established in the region consistently by the CSU.
This has been announced for 40 years by sociologists, but they have been strongly mistaken about the pace. However, secularization, educational results and establishment of northern and eastern Germans in the developing Bavarian region could not remain without consequence on the loyalty of CSU voters.
Modernisation goes hand in hand with increasing opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also visible.
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only within the party that voters have become more conscious, more critical and more stubborn.
It is also surprising that in the last few weeks, it is precisely the groups of classical citizens who have moved away from the CSU, such as the independents, artisans, bac holders and graduates of higher education.
In these groups, CSU support fell below 40 per cent.
Die Presse (dipresse.com)
In its article entitled "Who ? With whom ? Party Presidents stand on the reservation to the issues of the coalition", the conservative Austrian daily takes care of the situation of the confused domestic policy that settled after the Austrian elections.
The Austrian Socialists of SPÖ want to discuss with the Conservatives of ÖVP.
ÖVP prohibits SPÖ from interfering with its internal affairs.
The populist party BZÖ is open for negotiations. Greens do not want to agree on the coalition yet.
The elections took place, now all around the coalition; during the debates held on public television, the party leaders barely let themselves see their cards.
Werner Faymann, SPÖ president, confirmed that he wanted to discuss with ÖVP.
SPÖ wants to show that the collaboration of both parties is indeed possible - that is what already exists in some regions and in the socialist partnership.
The question that he would imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of ÖVP, as vice chancellor, remains open to Faymann.
As he mentioned, the Schüssel-Molterer orientation was, in any case, rejected.
A replica of this combination is out of question.
Moltier reacted with caution to red proposals.
As he has already said, collaboration will certainly be unsuccessful if Faymann tries to interfere with ÖVP's internal affairs.
In its party, the choice of opposition or entry into the coalition is momentarily an entirely open question, and these issues must absolutely be discussed within the ÖVP.
Jörg Haider, the President of BZÖ, is once again open to all proposals.
"To avoid the coalition of reds and blacks, we are ready to assume government responsibilities" said Haider.
Járóka said: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, in Paris, the European Summit for Equal Opportunities began, the host of which is France, as a representative of the current Presidency of the European Union.
In his message to the plenary meeting, as one of the main spokesmen of the expert consultation, Lívia Járóka, MEP Fidesz European People's Party, drew attention to the segregations in education, because it is a violation of the law that affects Roma children most and thus one of the main obstacles to their success in life.
On behalf of the French Presidency, this high-level conference was opened by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, and by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Labour, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among those invited to participate in the consultation are the European social partners, as well as the most prominent representatives of legal protection and European civil bodies, in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the Group of MP Fidesz Popular Party, Járóka has warned that, in addition to the distinctions found at the time of hiring, Roma are disappearing from the labour market, first of all, as a result of their low qualification.
"A overwhelming majority of Roma young people do not have high school diplomas, and as a result of poor basic education, only a small part has the possibility of obtaining a higher education degree."
Járóka also stressed that education as a basic right to human beings plays a key role in advocating other fundamental rights.
Investment in early education for Roma children means strengthening the economy of the EU member countries.
According to the Euro-Deputy, it is necessary to raise awareness of these relations in the widest possible circle, also between the Roma and the non-Romans.
Indeed, the earlier a Roma child begins school, the more he increases his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; by taxes paid from his income and consumption, he participates in the state budget.
"By their citizenship of the European Union, Roma must be guaranteed their right to quality education, and protected from low-quality and sectarian education." - said Lívia Járóka.
According to the Member of this Parliament, cooperation from the European Union towards an objective and action is necessary for the immediate acceleration of the process of disintegration of schools, so compliance with existing anti-discrimination directives and preparation is of paramount importance.
"The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and joblessness must be broken, giving the opportunities guaranteed by democracy to Roma children, so that they can participate as full citizens in the future of Europe" required Jaróka.
On behalf of the European Year for Equal Opportunities for All, the aim of the Summit on Equal Opportunities in Europe has been to ensure a unique platform to support measures taken to promote equality of opportunity and to combat discrimination, which are targeted at the European level and at the Member States.
CSU: Grace for a transitional period
It will be in October that the decision on the fate of the late Huber-Beckstein duo will be taken
Despite this pitiful electoral failure, the heads have not yet fallen, and the debate on personal issues at the summits of the Bavarian CSU has been adjourned.
The president of the party, Erwin Hube and the head of the regional government, Günther Beckstein, can still keep their place.
The fate of the tandem, having suffered a catastrophic loss of 17 percent, will be on the agenda of the congress of the exceptional party, held on the last weekend of October.
In any case, the members of this highly criticized pair felt that they did not hold their seats in particular.
As a result, they used to calm the angry members of the fraction and base, which one day after the "Bavarian Tsunami" demanded personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - it is true, still under the direction of Edmund Stoiber, at the top of his career - the Christian-so-Christian union won 60.7 percent, while today, one year after the putsch against Stoiber, there is only 43.4 percent left of their strength.
For 46 years, the CSU was the "only sovereign" of Bavaria giving 18 percent of German GDP.
However, conservatives still rely heavily on this region in the south, which is of key importance to the Hungarian economy. In the future, they will be forced to the coalition.
As one of the first signs of an internal redevelopment of the party, the Vice President and the Federal Minister of Agriculture, Horst Seehofer, presented as the possible successor to Huber, also received a seat in this modest recognition group, which initiates talks with the Liberals of the FDP, as well as with the Free Electors, formed along the right-wing values, about a possible coalition of the Munich government.
A strange foot of destiny was that, using the Free Electors list, Gabriele Pauli entered the legislation, whose measurement against Stroiber served as the possibility of putsch perpetrated by the Huber-Beckstein duo, and then without planning the very ambitious municipal political woman.
Now, CSU leaders are putting all their energy into stabilizing, in one way or another, Beckstein.
In this transition, Stoiber, who has so far cast the twins in the corridors, will also be given an active role. The former head of the regional government and former President of the CSU, designated September 28 as the most bitter day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made some bitter remarks to the CDU. According to him, they would have deserved much more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as a warning for the CDU and also for Angela Merkel.
Following the Bundestag elections, which will take place in September 2009, Merkel will once again be a chance only if they set up in one way or another, with a common force, the CSU, which has played an important role in the national success of 2005.
According to Merkel, the loss of land by the CSU will not negatively influence Berlin's great coalition, making it hard to hide its disappointment caused by fiasco.
But that is relative because it will no longer be easy to manage the injured CSU, and the crisis of socio-democrats still lasts.
Since 1946, the SPD has achieved its worst results by 18.6 per cent in Bavaria.
Lukasenko - its rivals: 110 - 0
No member of the opposition has acceded to the Belarusian parliament after the Sunday elections.
According to Russian observers, this is explained by a country led by Alexandre Lukashenko, which provides him with prosperity and stability, while according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is due to illegalities committed at the time of the vote.
The OSCE, having sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the elections.
Although the law of 110 people in that country has been very much opposed for decades, before the elections yesterday, the opposition uniting its forces under the name of the United Democratic Forces (DOSZ) seriously hoped that Lukashenko, renewing his term as president for the fourth time in dubious elections, on the traces of the amendment of the constitution in 2006, would "allow" this time the presence of a few MPs of the opposition to parliament.
In this way, the ODSZ gave up its original boycott.
The fact that Belarus, which is increasingly economically dependent on Russia, would like to improve its relations with the EU, where due to the Belarusian anti-democratic policy order, Lukashenko and several top politicians do not receive entry visas was one of the expectations of the opposition. Belarus had to make a credit because of the ever-cost reduction in imports of Russian natural gas, and thus contributed to the transition of Beltransgaz, owner of the gas pipelines across the country, went to the hands of the Russians.
The fact that the OSCE, during the campaign evaluation, focused on positive changes rather than failures, such as the prohibition of one third of the opposition candidates, referred to a pre-departure.
However, the OSCE communiqué of Monday had already challenged the campaign, during which the bulk of the opposition candidates could not appear in the media, and in particular the fact that the opposition could not be present at the time of the vote.
Despite all this, the opposition still feels a tangible improvement in the political regime: political prisoners have regained their freedom, and Minsk is ready for small confrontations with Moscow, still refusing to recognize the South Ossetia and the Abazzia separated from Georgia. Now, Russia with which Belarus forms a confederation on paper, considers the two independent territories for a month.
"We took two steps forward, and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue was started between Belarus and the EU," Alexandre Milinkevitch told our newspaper.
According to the candidate for opposition to the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable that this remain, although "power has been frightened in this Parliament which has no weight, to bring even one opponent".
The opposition does not provide for action to protest in the light of the results, but rather tries to send its message about the need for economic reforms to electors.
"Of course, we have a lot of concerns on this side: we have to print our opposing newspapers in Russia, the local authorities are putting us on the wheels for broadcasting, but I can also see that they are increasingly supporting the elections, even in the circle of the elderly," said Milinkevitch, referring to the fact that in the present Lukashenko regime, which considers social security as its main result, the most officially supported retirees' layer does not really consider it appropriate anymore.
"Because of the country's debt and the increase in trade deficit, the collapse of social security, 'evoking the silence of a cemetery', is only a matter of time" - Milinkevitch estimates.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers have qualified democratic elections.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian press agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words, but in deeds." Thus, the absence of the opposition is only proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From today, breakfast before work".
Never, in the history of the Chigi Palace, have we never had turning doors for the entry and exit of employees.
But from today, this new measure is in effect against the smart little ones, against whom she points and then goes to the bar to drink coffee during working hours.
The anti-poor novelty was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary-General of the Council Presidency, Mauro Masi.
"The rotating doors," says Brunetta, "are an instrument for better working, with more productivity, more presences and more services," said the Minister.
Now a new season of responsibility and transparency begins.
"It's reformism," Brunetta added.
The facility in all institutions of the Presidency of the Council is completed with the Chigi Palace.
According to Masi, "the choice of rotating doors is important even from a symbolic point of view.
No resistance on the part of employees has been recorded, says the Secretary General: "it is a process shared by the employees, and we have had the collaboration of all."
In short, more breakfast during working hours; more coffee or croissant.
Brunetta's promise, which suggests with a smile, "a good cappuccino at 7am is an excellent and healthy resolution".
At a conference at the Superior School of Public Administration
The Minister of Rome reports that "in three months, the absences of public employees' disease have decreased by 50%, i.e. 60 thousand workers more than a year".
And he adds that it is essential to make the Public Administration more effective.
Italy, "including wage dynamics- explains the Minister- over the last 8-10 years have doubled compared to the private sector, and much more than inflation rates.
At the same time, thousands of public employees joined to challenge the standards of the Brunetta Decree using the Codacons.
"While the Minister of Public Service is now collecting data on the decline of absenteeism in the workplace due to illness-writes the association of consumers-the people of the "active faners" continues to increase.
In Italy, thousands of employees of the correct and productive Public Administration met to declare war on the illegitimate standards contained in the decree.
In particular, in the Tar, the exclusion of additional allowances in case of disability for reasons of service is contested; the extension of the hours of the home stay of the sick worker, during which inspection visits are made, as well as other aspects contained in the new provisions required by the Minister.
Accidents on the workplace, Napolitano: "Criminal prevention"
Every day, in Italy, 2,500 work accidents, 3 deaths and 27 people remain permanently disabled.
In 2007, the Inail data confirmed that white deaths were approximately 1,200.
Figures that demonstrate the severity of the phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of death and cause almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
For the attention of institutions, social forces and the media on this dramatic aspect, Anmil celebrates today, in all Italian provinces, the 58th National Day of Labour Accidents, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The disturbing data broadcast by Anmil, as well as the tragic events of the last few days, confirm the importance of the topic of prevention at the workplace," said the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, in a message sent to the President of Anmil, National Association of Mutilates and Invalid Workers, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his sincere appreciation for the ongoing joint effort to prevent at work, protect the injured workers, assist the families of victims and raise awareness of public opinion.
"Of course, everyone has hit a punch to put an end to such tragedies, which, by their dimension, arouse the clamour of the media and the participation of public opinion, even though the daily reality presents dramatic, even repetitive, cases in their dynamics.
Napolitano does not hide that "there is certainly a resource problem: it is essential to invest in training and information"
The many initiatives promoted in the school sector are of particular importance for a more direct awareness of young people entering the world of work.
It is our duty, to maintain attention to this phenomenon, not to assess the alarm on social gravity, to implement and improve legislative standards.
For his part, the President of the Gianfranco Fini Chamber has emphasized how much" this phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which insults the conscience of each of us, and requires all institutions to make a concrete effort to put an end to it quickly".
The data of the accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not prevent the number of white deaths is still impressive," later stressed the president of the Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
"we do not wish this "tendance to the downfall" to be in fact translated into minor attention, because it is precisely when the attention relaxes, the tragedy comes.
"We believe that in general, we do not do enough to contrast the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be made through multiple actions."
"As Mercandelli pointed out, more controls and inspections are needed, as is a more important intervention on the training of workers, and this, from school."
He added that further efforts should be made to communicate and raise public awareness.
"But above all, we need a greater sense of employers' responsibilities in the face of a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
" Mercandelli then denounced "the gradual deterioration of the conditions of safeguard of the expected compensation for the victims of work" and "the drift of assistance towards which the system has been oriented in recent years".
"The objective, therefore, is to give the worker the insurance guarantee - he added - so that the destiny of the person who has an accident, must not depend on the spontaneism or the enlargement of the legislator"
Mp3 reader pointed to the finger, they put the hearing at risk.
Listen to full-volume music for an extended period using portable music devices such as MP3 players, can cause permanent hearing injuries.
This is what the European Commission announces, which, in a communiqué in Brussels, cites the opinion of the Scientific Committee, on the unanticipated and recently identified health risks (Csserri) of the EU, published today.
"of this scientific- lisons report we in the note- it is clear that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to full-volume music using portable musical devices, for more than one hour per day and week, risk a permanent loss of hearing ability."
"I am concerned that such an important number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and full-volume mobile phones can unconsciously damage their hearing in an irreparable way," says Meglena Kuneva.
"According to scientific data - the EU leader continues - it is a clear risk and we need to respond quickly.
What is most important is to raise awareness and make this information public.
We must also review existing control systems in view of scientific opinion so that they are fully effective and can monitor new technologies."
Brussels asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the intensive use of portable musical devices and the increase in the number of young noise exposures they generate.
"Scientists-conclude the Executive EU- confirm that there are good reasons to be alarmed, and that the European Commission will now examine with the Member States and other interested parties what measures might possibly be adopted to better protect children and adolescents, against noise exposure from portable musical devices and similar devices.
There is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable musical devices to 100Db, but concern increases as to the auditory damage that could result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to properly limit these data using solutions such as reducing noise levels and duration of exposure.
The Scientific Committee notes that users of portable musical devices, who listen to full volume music (more than 89 decibels) for 5 hours a week, exceed the current limits on the maximum permitted noise level at the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions over extended periods risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity after 5 years.
This affects 5-10% of the users of these devices, and their number can be quantified to approximately 2.5 million and 10 million people in the U.S.
Rome, Germano has ordered the Commission to leave for the future of the capital.
Today we start, in March we end, in June we will get the money.
This is the timetable laid down by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capital", which took place this morning in the new seat behind the Therms of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will draw up the directives for Rome.
In March, when they are completed, the Committee and the Council will evaluate the analyses and projects in order to present in June the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official stamp " of the Capitol and its Mayor Gianni Germano.
"The commission is absolutely independent; all the political, social and cultural ideas are represented there - it is important to emphasize German - it will have to propose ideas for the development of Rome to be used by the political decision-makers, who remain the Committee and the Council.
No overlap of roles, but only the will to have a corner to develop a great project for Rome.
In March, it will finish its work and then disappear, as this experience must have a precise timeframe.
In June-announce the mayor- we will present the strategic plan resulting from the work of the Commission for the Future of Rome Capital."
For those who accuse the Commission of being unnecessary, since its views will not be binding, Germano replies: "It depends on the work the Commission will be able to do, as well as on the quality of its proposals.
If quality is there, as in France thanks to the Attali Commission, as in Rome, I am sure, its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics is affected by day-to-day management and emergencies that occur from time to time.
On the contrary, we want to see forward, and further, towards a deeper perspective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future."
In addition, the Mayor of Rome wishes to point out that "this Commission is not an unnecessary body or a bureaucratic ensemble: it is absolutely free, and will not cost a euro to the Roman citizens, and will serve to study and involve the best intelligence that expresses the Capital.
For Germano, indeed, "it requires a strategic draft of reference, neither firm nor immovable, in order to enable our city to improve, what it absolutely needs, while thinking of its future now a unitary spirit."
A future which, the mayor of Rome, "will not be limited to the usual communal borders, but which will look further" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as Capital, but also in relation to the role that Rome can and must have, as the Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? First President of the U.S., that's why.
A famous American politician who wants to become independent wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second president of the U.S.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, on the part of his decisions, destroyed the US economy and had relations (as he still has today, as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam."
Attacks on Obama increase as the election date draws closer.
A Miami lady wrote on a website: "This person is full of ambition".
Obama is truly clumsy: he believes he will gain the highest function of a nation that counts in all, two governors and five black senators!"
In fact, these are attacks that do not say much; they are of course racial attacks, and do not answer the question of all voters: will he be a good president? We also have the polls, who declare that Obama will win and with a good advantage.
In this case, it is still someone who talks with the heart and not with the brain.
A Mississippi newspaper, in the entrances of the southern United States, wrote an article: once in the voting booth, we know who the American patriot will give his vote.
This is what emerges from an aspect of American mentality that remains secret until the end.
"Say what you want, we'll see ourselves put the cross on Obama or McCain.
There are even people who swear: if Obama wins, we will leave the United States.
Choices never revealed so far, to such an extent that the success of the black candidate seems almost certain.
In any case, despite all this reasoning, the winning map for Democrats is George Bush.
We asked 1500 people: what were the mistakes made by Bush during his term of office? 89 percent responded: Iraq.
America changes.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50 miles of soldiers and was sent home by foot to the buttocks.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers lost their lives, and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Despite this, Iraq was, for the most part, the point of Bush's weakness.
Who will take George W's place will have a huge spot to accomplish.
Usa, the economic chaos is felt even among journalists: in the press, it is time for the removals. And many accuse the Internet, this "killer" of the newspaper.
Five hundred American journalists were questioned by the PEW Research Center about the status of their profession and mental control for the future.
Well, almost all journalists today are pessimistic about their future.
However, they did not openly express their concerns about credibility to the information partners.
They don't feel isolated like they used to be.
The problem with American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a destroyed economic model crisis.
In addition, the removals made in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work at the newspaper assembly, are a major problem.
It is a problem that needs to be resolved, according to journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism as the general public hears it, is not reduced accordingly.
A more complex pessimism invades American journalism.
Six out of ten senior executives and press journalists are convinced that journalism at the national level is following a bad path.
Locally, the executive group is 65%.
Printed publication against broadcast.
Journalists don't have a hard time finding out where the web is.
The largest publishing houses are passing to the Internet, perceived by many as the "killer" of newspaper paper.
The "economic pressure" felt by journalists is increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted to putting themselves in technology hoping that it would "do something good" for their journalism.
Today, the biggest accroc in American journalism lies among those who run the newsrooms - i.e. the directors - and the reporters who work for them.
56% of managers at the national level are convinced that reporters share their values, while at the local level, this percentage falls to 23%.
For some, this is linked to "work safety".
The managers who think they lose their jobs in 3 years of age are 47% at the national level.
As far as journalists are concerned, we're going to 30%.
The one of the "safe work" at the staff level (no editors, ndr) in America is still on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In an immense nation like the Usa, with 300 million people and thousands of journalists, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, and this quickly becomes a question to take or leave.
The directors receive almost always large salaries, while the editor can earn $10 thousand a month, in addition to retirement and insurance payments.
As for holidays, logic becomes complicated: x days after the first year, x days after the third, up to 15 days in all, spent a number of years.
But, according to their revelations, American journalists are often "diseased" during the year.
It's the fault of the climate.
UNIPOL:TRIBUNAL ROME, DANILO COPPOLA remains the GROTTAFERRATA.
The president of the second criminal section of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the appeal of the real estate agent Danilo Coppola, who had asked to be able to leave his city, Grottaferrata, for a home in Rome.
. Coppola is investigated for the bankway in the course of the Unipol-Bnl Scale Education.
In his trial, last week, he was granted the release of his home in compulsory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estate agent be able to travel the city of province to a home in the capital.
According to the court, such travel (which the pm did not grant) would allow it to influence its society and to have access to the evidence that accuses it.
The elites are in danger.
The phenomenon had already appeared a few days ago, with the vote of the House of Representatives, contrary to the $700 billion rescue plan approved by the White House: a significant number of Americans were, and is still more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the American economy.
And it is well the New York Times yesterday that confirms it by communicating that the current crisis divides the Republican Party, even more divided between its early, moderate East Coast soul, in favour of federal institutions as well as business community, and its new soul, on the contrary, conservative, hostile to "the ones of Washington" and to the world of finance, powerful especially in the states of Central and South.
The soul, precisely, which made itself feel despotically with the vote that I was speaking to you at the beginning.
However, what has just been mentioned is just one example of the changes, major changes that the current economic earthquake predicts or already leaves to run: not only in the United States, but throughout the West, and it can be not only here.
In the United States as in Europe, the crisis seems to speed up the phenomena covered for some time, so much so that in the new climate they solidify and reveal themselves.
The first of these phenomena is the re-upgrading, the extraordinary revival, of the dual category of the sovereign state, in relation to a kind of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking-financial institutions which, of course, have close relations with the foreign country, but which, above all, are involved on a large scale, the balance sheets of individuals and families living in one country, in one state.
This immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: that is to say how to respond to the difficulties and protests of the people and families who are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears economically global but politically, it is almost only here national.
Political internationalisation seems really out of play, or has little to say: the obvious evidence is provided by the European Union, which, shared as usual, among the various interests and among the various national strategies, does not succeed in deciding any common political lines.
And so it is from the government of each state that everyone expects interventions, rescue and recovery plans, new rules, and above all a credit condition: when we go through a difficult period, there is only the States that have economic resources, the mass of financial resources that can try to put things back in place.
They also have the necessary means and legitimization to use them: two resources of inestimable value, elements of which no market or international organization can ever have in a similar manner.
This new emphasis on the state-nation crisis is, of course, in perfect harmony with the ever-increasing importance that the most recent economic developments in the economy tend to attribute to a factor quite related to this element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had now entered the realm of the network, of increasingly sophisticated technology, of non-material, convinced that globalized finance was now destined to dominate the world, we realized at once that our future would, on the contrary, have to settle more and more with the rather little material things such as water, crops, oil.
Things that can certainly be transported from one place to another of the earth, but which are absolutely linked to a confined space, to a territory.
Thus, who is sovereign, certainly has more cards than the one who is not, that is, the one who has the misfortune to live in a place without harvest, without oil and without water.
I now come to the second novelty which, however, foresees a fracture.
Who says Territorial, State, Government, inevitably said Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective need for authoritarian leadership, the search for a person who knows how to take over the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leadership, economic species that have proved to be inadequate and full of shadow areas.
And also, something even deeper, in a certain sense, even worrying: a discredit, a suffering, an image of inadequacy, a feeling of remoteness that tends to involve the entire class of directors in a growing number of Western countries.
This increases the conviction of the various classes, before the actions are the same ideas of the social elites until now at their height, their listening and being, their culture in the complex acceptance of the term, having the same time, and being increasingly foreign to the opinions of the majority.
In short, the demand for leadership, food underground, a powerful and re-enacted movement of delegitimizations of the ruling classes and traditional political orders, which manifest themselves in improvised electoral "revolts" or, in the changes of collective moods of the last few times, from the conservative ascension in Austria Bavaria, at the fall of the workers in Britain, to the rebellion of the American congressmen against Bush (and it could well be that the victory of the right in Italy did not happen by chance).
It is felt that traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rituals, their newspapers, their intellectuals accredited, their format, someone would say, have ever more difficulty, which does not date today, to understand and therefore to represent the deep layers of Western societies, and that the economic crisis reinforces, increases and acts potentially in a way that is far worse.
In view of all this, speaking of a current "rebellion of the masses" on the agenda, seems frankly exaggerated.
But we say well, keeping our eyes wide open, that's not for no reason.
The super neck to walk on the walls.
Break the laws of gravity through a super glue and, in the future, walk on the walls like Spiderman.
This is the goal of various U.S. research centres, and today a team of four institutes has almost succeeded.
With an adhesive it was barely 2.5 square centimeters, the researchers managed to keep a body of 100 kilograms glued on a vertical wall.
ETUDE- The U.S. journal Science published the findings of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material, invented by the team of researchers, is an evolution of those we know that use a particular structure of carbon, called nano carbon tubes.
"The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged as a stack of spaghetti." Explains Zhong Lin Wang of Georgia Institute of Technology of Atlanta.
Scientists have inspired themselves from geckos legs, covered with microscopic hairs that ensure the animal, a perfect adherent.
Tests on various materials, such as glass, Teflon, and glass paper, have demonstrated that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles, and at the same time, that it "is easily detached from the wall" explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
MARKING ON MURS? –" this material could be used as a temporary adhesive" adds Liming Dai.
Could it be to walk on the walls like Spiderman? Perhaps yes, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use such as the connection between electronic devices, since carbon nano tubes are electric power and heat drivers.
Other applications may concern aerospace engineering.
For now, no superhero.
THE OTHER RESEARCH- The University of Berkeley, California, is also committed to seeking a new adhesive.
In an article in the American Chemical Society magazine, Californian researchers presented a adhesive made of microfibre such as hair, which cleans itself from dust during the movement on an area to ensure a perfect and constant adherence.
Medicines: never with fruit juices.
Attention to grapefruit juice, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed mainly in the summer because they are desaturating and rich in vitamins, if associated with certain vital drugs, alter the amplifying or decreasing absorption as appropriate, their effectiveness, with even serious health consequences.
David Nailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, recalls the risks of fruit juices, whether in box or fresh, if associated with ingestion of certain drugs; during the 236th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he launches a new alarm: it is enough of a glass of grapefruit juice, orange and apple juice, to reduce the absorption of certain vital drugs, canceling their beneficial effects and endangering the health of patients.
Grapefruit juice has already been strongly criticised as it has been held responsible for increasing the effects of certain anti-arrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, anti-stamine and neurological drugs up to toxic levels.
A RISK- It is the Italian Medicines Agency itself, which has given the news in a two-year information bulletin, alerting doctors and patients not to assess the dangers arising from this mix and to be careful that they drink, if they are taken medicines such as Diazepam or Methadone.
NOT THE PAMPLEMOUSE- According to experts, even orange and apple juice contains substances that inhibit drugs.
Long is the list of active substances inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
From there, Michele Carruba, director of the Department of Pharmacology of the Public University of Milan: "These discoveries are generally, immediately reported to the various national and international drug agencies that will need to change the informative notes of the drugs.
It is always appropriate to read the illustrative papers of the medicines that are taken, and, if something is not clear, do not get impressed, but to speak clearly to the doctor or pharmacist," the expert at the Ansa Agency pointed out.
The Nobel Prize in Economics in Paul Krugman.
The Nobel Prize in the Economy was awarded to American Paul Krugman for his research on trade models and on the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a New Kenyan who teaches at the University of Princeton and is also a famous editorialist of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most critical solutions in the Bush administration's foreign economy and policy.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks during the days of Enron's bankruptcy, Krugman had written, in an article published on the New York Times, that the second event would have been more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on the history of the United States.
A forecast that has resulted in many controversy, which has been reproached by the economist for years, but has now proved to be accurate.
"I am surprised and even a little shocked by the speed with which the memory of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom has disappeared from public attention," said Krugman at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "high-value economist", but also a very aggressive divulgator", particularly critical to the excesses of the Bush administration's liberalism.
Open Office, here is the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
It is the day of the release of OpenOffice.org.3.0, the open source of personal productivity that aims to always and even more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, offering a free alternative to the most famous Microsoft Office.
Following a work of almost a year, carried out by volunteer developers, monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office package shows to the general public with various new features: from the welcome screen, and the revised and less austere interface, to other important ones, such as the compatibility created for the Apple Mac OS X operating system, and the support for the new ODF format (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest ISO standard.
Open Office has paid particular attention to interaction with Office 2007, and it is possible to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx.)
Also interesting, some specific functions to some modules, such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example, to send them by email, or to import PDF files into the graphics module, preserving the original aspect of the page.
Also on this front, it is possible to create "PDF hybrids" documents that combine the typical Adobe format chart with the elements of a spreadsheet or text maker.
Collaboration between several people is an element that has had various improvements within applications: in the spreadsheet, various users can intervene, avoiding conflicts on changes, in the drafting of texts, because each employee is assigned a color of comment for better recognition in the review phase.
Some companies are even working to bring some OpenOffice functions on the Web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks, they should deliver the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.htmlet and is in addition to the English version on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the suite is as usual available in addition, for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD may be shipped at home or at the workplace.
And if the topic of gratuity can be a means of spreading it into homes, it is precisely in business, that Open Office will then challenge the great challenge, which can already count on various projects carried out in the public administration and schools.
Not to mention the realities that offer training, consultation and assistance service, ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could also open up to business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for Word's equivalent writing video; Calc, is the spreadsheet to replace Excel; Impress, for PowerPoint's rival presentations;Dbase, such as the famous Access, is the program that allows you to work on databases; finally Drwa is the graphic module.
Target for 2008, reaching 5 million downloads, and considering that today there are almost 3 million and 600 miles, it is likely that with the release of the new version, we can even exceed the expected figure
Kohl too, it's positive, it's the fourth case of doping.
New case of positivity at the last Tour de France: he is the Austrian of the team Gerolsteiner, Bernhard Kohl, third-qualified, and winner of the best climber's jersey.
It is the daily website The Team reports the news.
At 26 years old, Kohl is the fourth positive cyclist in the Cera, the third generation Epo, after the Italians Riccardo Riccó and Leonardo Piepoli, and German Stefan Schumacher, as well as Gerolsteiner.
The blood tests performed on the Kohl specimens are part of the tests carried out in recent weeks by the laboratories in Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-analysis confirms the positivity of the Cera, the Austrian will lose its third place on the Tour and will have to expect two years of elimination.
The news of Kohl's third-generation positivity was confirmed by the French Anti-Doping Agency leader Pierre Bordry, who communicated to the Associated Press, having notified the Austrian authorities of the positivity.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed himself on the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, thus cooling the peas jersey of the best climber.
IMMERS: NEW YORK TIMES REQUEST IF ITALY IS RACE?
Italy "as countries of emigrants has recently become a privileged destination for immigrants" welcomed with reluctance.
Would this turn the beautiful country into a nation of racists? Here's what the New York Times is about that dedicated a long article on the subject of racism in Italy, starting with the case of the young Abdul William Guibre, who came from Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan, for stealing a box of biscuits.
This case highlights what the New York Times defines as the "northern paradox": the northern regions are both where we register" more integration and more work", but also" an anti-immigrant feeling that is the strongest in the country and the most important support for the Northern Lega"
To confirm the increasing tension between Italians and immigrants, the NYT also referred to the episodes of intolerance of Milan, Parme, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only.
Even the new legislation required by the League to curb immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegals is cited as proof of climate change in Italy.
Trends highlighted by the Pope as well as by the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano at his meeting with Benedict XVI in Quirinal, asked that the state and the Church work together to overcome racism."
Students who are victims of expensive rents, up to 900 euros for one room.
The student rental market doesn't know about crisis
According to the last Sunia survey, the tenant's union, renting a single room can cost a student, up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now reached very serious aspects to the point of excluding whole categories of young people, from the right to study due to the very high global costs that coming families have to support - explains the head of the study office in Sunia, Laura Mariani- in these cities, the high demand of students has so distorted the market that a process of widespread increase has begun for residents.
In most cases, rental offers also involve a series of violations: free, unregistered, rent-free, sub-locations.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions through the review of tax taxes are necessary to calm prices.
Reading the survey in detail, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, it takes approximately 450 euros; for a single room, it goes from a minimum of 650 euros (Blackband area), to an average value of 800 (Lambate area, Udine, and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 euros (Vittoria area)
In Florence, an average bed costs 350/400 euros, one bedroom about 700 euros.
In Bologna, where students focus in the near areas of the University, it takes 250/280 euros for a bed in a double, and 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, in the areas close to central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), approximately 600 euros are required for a simple, 450 for a double bed.
Smaller values (550 euros for a simple one) for areas close to other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
You can save only if you move away from the peripheral areas: 300 euros for one bed, and 450 euros for one single in the Predestina, Centocella or similar area.
In Naples, for a bed it takes 300/400 euros, for a simple one, you spend 400 to 600 euros, with higher prices in the Polyclinic, Vomero, and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari, for bed, at least EUR 250/350 for a single bed.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they are of major importance in the city economy.
Finally, cities such as Perugia, where rents are often taken by extra-community students, a further anomaly is recorded: the rent required for foreign students is increased by 25/30% compared to that applied to Italians.
Farewell old Paradiso cinema, the cities choose the historic halls.
The historical cinemas close in favour of the Multiplex.
"A city without cinema halls is a blind city, it's like a face without eyes"
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore, illustrates well what is happening in the large Italian urban centres, but also in the cities of province,
The process of marginalization of the cinemas, with the birth on the outskirts of the large multirooms, and the death of consumption of the mono-rooms in the central areas of the cities, is one of the major events that seems inescapable and indisputable to us; it also has all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
To disappear, they are often historical places and charged with memory, "it is as if one of my friends disappeared, someone we know, with whom we shared a end of the road and so many emotions" observes the director of the New Heavenly Cinema, a film that offers to Tornatore 20 years ago, the first Oscar as well as the Grand Prix of the Cannes Jury, and who told the poetry of a province hall, and nostalgia in a way of living the movie, lost can be forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the main trading association, mean everything: over the past five years, 316 traditional cinemas have closed, and these are the halls of the main cities that have paid the costs: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the areas most affected by the closure, Emilia Romaine has 82 cinemas mono halls lost, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
The evidence that confirms that the first responsible for their disappearance is the advent of multiplex, because it is the three Italian regions that have recorded the most new multi-room cinemas: 195 screens in Lombardy over the past five years, 81 in Tuscany as well as Emilia-Romagna.
"The Italian exploitation has grown irrationally" observes Paolo Protti, President of the Anec, "it is useful to build new structures, but it should still ensure the survival of those that already exist, because when a room closes in a city, these people are not necessarily all willing to go to multiplex.
Not to mention the lack of discussion of credit for traders: the former debt of the state is about 10 million euros.
It is shameful that, from an ethical and moral point of view, the Government does not comply with existing laws.
To support the sector, between EUR 16 million and EUR 18 million a year.
Let us note the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, worried about these closures, has decided to resolve the situation through the signing of a protocol between Mairie and Anec, the first of this kind in Italy, to defend and promote the cinemas mono halls of the historic and periphery centres.
The planned regulations include tax facilities for managers and benefits to the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the restricted traffic area, and special rates will be available for parking and in certain parking spaces.
"It's an initiative that I like" observes Giuseppe Tornatore "and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna putting in place other measures.
However, it is clear that, to contrast the superpower of multiplex, traditional rooms must also improve the quality of sound and image, as today's audience is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the Supercinema de Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make "New Cinema Paradiso" to which I've been thinking for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass before the Rialto, or the Quirinal of Via Nazionale, now closed, where I have experienced so much shared emotions, I turn from the other side not to see the black panels by the dust.
Links between politics and 'drangheta, arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro.
"The Mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to standardize the Mayor's choices to the interests of the Piromalli clan."
Major accusations are launched by the magistrates of the Directorate anti-mafia de la Calabre, towards the mayor and vice mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione, as well as Rosario Schiavione, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external competition for Mafia association.
The sleeves also for Gioacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his little son lawyer, homonymous of the boss, already convicted for association of mafia-type criminals, as well as to pay 10 million euros.
"an affront to legal and moral norms, and above all good sense," the prosecutors wrote, both local governments had expressed the desire to pay for consultations with Master Pyromalli.
"This would have been given to the clan - the judges write - to officially enter the town halls making it easier for the already considerable public administration to control and guide the public administration"
The president of the regional committee Agazio Loero, not only hides "collusions between local committees and organized crime, there are more than one" in the region: "there are places where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are also many politicians who resist the pressures of the drangheta, heroes who are honest"
This morning's arrests follow those last July, after which the police announced having beheaded the Piromalli clan.
As of late April, Gioia Tauro's municipal council had been dissolved; already in 1991, and because of alleged conditioning between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been discharged from their duty to administer the city.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the UDC at the time of dissolution, had been appointed head of a right center coalition, after the May 2006 ballet.
He screamed at the scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the communal council.
He accused the vice minister of the interior at the time, Marco Minniti, the accuser of having handled everything for a political issue, but given the request for incarceration signed this morning, the judges explain that the Piromalli clan had even succeeded in asking for the variation of the A3 project.
From the interviews ordered against Dal Torrione, the pm wrote, "the availability to marry the demands of a business man, representative of a more well-known group, close to the Pyromalli, uniforming the choices of public administration to the interests of the clan.
When the energy is born of waves, now the bigs are starting.
This is an unexploded deposit that occupies more than 70% of the planet's surface and now the major global energy companies are discovering it.
Waves, currents, tides, these are the new renewable sources on which colosses like Chevron have laid their eyes, and now try to put their hands on them.
The possibility of getting energy from sea movements has been studied for hundreds of years, and in the 1970s, in line with the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
When the price of oil fell, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was put aside, but now the ecologists and the new increase in oil give a great boost to the sector
In 2007, London's World Energy Council (WEC) estimated that 15% of the global electricity requirement could be covered by sea houle operating systems.
This would be twice as much as the quantity produced by nuclear power plants.
And in addition, there would be currents and tides..
Colossess to the attack.
The first company to be put on marine energy was Energy, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build a facility in northern Portugal.
When the agreement was announced, we would have said a true revolutionary step.
Two years ago, more and more of these traditional energy-driven companies put on marine energy.
"Chevron is currently studying ocean energy technologies," said the spokesperson of a company associated with the American oil colossus, at the Wall Street Journal economic daily, and she assesses the possibilities of cooperating with us."
The cooperation in question concerns the obtaining of a permit by the US Energy Commission, which is necessary to implement a marine energy exploitation project in Alaska.
This is a very interesting signal, especially if we consider that precisely in Alaska, the Usa continues to extract oil, and President Bush has recently put in place a project for new excavations.
In addition to Chevron, there is Verdant Power Inc. From New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey, which travel the way of energy from the sea, and the money invested so far, although their details are not known, indicate, according to observers, an increasing interest.
Technology to be developed.
Experts are still talking about technology at its beginning, on the other hand, the fact that marine energy does not dispel fears about the ecological impact.
Currently, systems such as those in Portugal, or some in Scotland, are small in size, and do not seem to create a major ecosystem problem.
To produce large-scale energy, however, technologies must be used with a higher ecological impact.
"And the choices are diverse: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of mud connected to each other.
The wave push, which moves the mud up and down, is converted into a hydraulic pressure of the pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
Pressure turns a turbine that, in turn, feeds a generator.
The energy is sent to the shore through underwater cables.
For now, we have four such systems in the project phase, pending a single federal approval and some of the energy could be used for a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the contrary, already produces energy for a commercial centre and a parking using six marine turbines from the East River in New York.
The movement of water during tides, rotates the blades of turbines, creating a rotating movement that feeds a generator.
Verdant announced that he has a long list of customers waiting for the authorizations needed to draw energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say to the Institute for the Research of Electric Energy, deserves the potential of tides at this time.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable of wind, sun, or waves, and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
And it is precisely on tide energy that states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, together with others, look at the coast, invested $7 million and a half in 2008 and forecast investments up to 35 million in 2009.
