What will happen? CSSD knows neither Voldemort nor pastry in Prague.
The new CSSD elected at the capital city hall will apparently have to overcome a real language barrier to understand at the municipal council level with their former and new ODS colleagues.
The current daily newspaper "tested" to new members of the municipal council belonging to CSSD, namely whether they knew the argment that was born in recent years at the city hall, when it was the partners of the current coalition that were leading to Prague.
The word coded that Prague's political cream started in the previous era of Mayor Pavel Bem describes some of the personalities, situations, and causes of the metropolis.
It was with surprise that it was discovered that the new elect did not fully understand the known terms.
At least they say it.
"Who is Valdemort."
"I really don't know."
"I am a fast in the pragmatic policy has reacted to Lukas Kaucky, who is elected to culture in the test of the word "parrain".
And with regard to the political veteran, the elected Karel Brezina reacted the same way.
For example, the meaning of "golf walk".
"It's the only expression you propose me to use"
Otherwise, I don't use the pin.
From the vocabulary, whose daily Aktualne.cz published the expressions in June of this year before the pre-Ectoral Congress of the ODS, the editorial selected 6 examples, in priority those related to the city hall of Prague.
The socialists had to explain the meaning of "Voldemort", "the largest golf hole in Prague", go to the pastries, "nerf de boeuf", "trahison de la capital" and "enoler".
Three of the elected members agreed for the quiz, the fourth-Antonin Weinert, who must lead education in Prague in the future - first promised an interview but then did not pick up the phone.
The fifth elite Petr Dolinek has largely refused the test.
"I am not taking care of all these things and how the representatives of citizen democracy enjoy themselves: I will not give my opinion."
"I am currently dealing with the way we will understand ourselves in our programs," he responded.
As has already been heard, Lukukau Kaucky would not seem to recognize in the legend above, that it is the influence of Janousek on the entrepreneurs and friends of ex-Maire Roman Bem.
"Voldemort" doesn't say anything to Kaucky and the only expression he came into the test is "the largest golf hole in Prague".
"It's the Blanka tunnel," Kaucky says, and he adds immediately, "but I know about the newspapers."
"I'm going to have to pay for a language course," he joked.
Not only the killer Karel Brezina but also Lukas Picture, the elected for the environment, know that the golf hole is the tunnel of Blanko.
The two social democrats know who is really Voldemort and Lukas Picture knows where to find the character - he thinks in the sense of going to the pastry.
"It's, I think, going to a company," imagines it's ready to guess that it's the headquarters of Janousek's companies.
In the same way, Brezina recalls that he draws his knowledge from newspapers rather than from any vocabulary he would use.
According to the test candidates, there is no lexicon of arght in social democracy.
"I took advice with colleagues and it looks like we really don't have something like this."
"The names are sometimes said to be abbreviations and symbols," said Peter Hlinsky, President of the Social Democratic Party, who members of the Party call Hulda.
"My name was Briza at school, but I don't know if my colleagues call me that, I confess, Karel Brezina, about the nicknames.
The newspaper Actuel.cz tested the name and it works.
The elected Weinert is Papy for Party members or the least friendly Little old, the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to him before elections by scams during the party's sponsoring, is called "the small game".
The nicknames are also the only ones that allow the social democrats to use within the party.
It seems that Hulinsky doesn't like to hear Hulda, but the daily Auktel.cz has recorded another nickname for this pragois president.
"Doctor in law of matraque" said Petr Hulinsky obtained his title as doctor in law JUDr. at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to reduce the tortures of "sorcers", published a brochure.
In Burkina Faso, women declared as sisters have common traits.
They are part of the old generation, they can't work for example for health reasons, they're free and they don't have children.
The one who becomes "sister" is isolated so as not to threaten the rest of the village.
"Man has very rarely this destiny."
"You don't judge healthy young women either because they participate in work and give birth to children," said a sister in the capital of this West African country, Burkina Faso, in a special institution of over 100 women who were rejected by society.
The local government has decided to intervene against this unusual "social measure".
He published a brochure that should help limit the hunt to witches.
The case has a "hic".
"More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," warned the daily Die Standard about the inconvenience of written education.
The accusation of witchcraft is common in other African countries.
In Ghana, neighboring Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemma, a 72-year-old woman died after being tortured by three women and a man then burned with oil that they had sprinkled on her.
This information was transmitted by the BBC server.
Criminals claim it was a bad eye.
According to their version, the oil that serves ritual onions has ignited the woman's contact.
The oil appeared to have burst when the team wanted to "shut up the evil spirit" of the woman.
Isolation of "surgeons" is approved by people of all levels of education.
The daily Der Standard cited a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "Human spirit eaters have always represented a danger," he said.
While Burkina Faso is trying to reduce witch hunting, not later than last year the Gambia has even seen the President himself participate in it.
"Gambian President Dzammi, after the death of his aunt, has launched a large hunt for witches who, he seems, would have participated in his death and would have been forced by black magic to kill the President as well."
"Nine Guinean shamans who came to rescue her, brought to the presidential farm in Kahali, under the protection of police officers and the personal custody of the President, men and women who were randomly chosen in the villages of Gambia," the organization "Amnesty International said in a message.
On the farm, people in prison had to drink a plant-based potion with hallucinogenic effects that also caused other effects on the kidneys and intestines.
Two prisoners didn't survive.
International pressure is about a thousand people who were released.
Bacal tenant: The stoves warm, he signed a higher rent.
An old man who is imposing came out of the door of the client centre of the RPG Byty company of the "carbon baron" Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of apartments to rent in the Czech Republic.
He carried under his arm a file with three new rental contracts for three apartments: his own, his daughter and his son who was serving a sentence.
Deregulation has increased the rent to these three people.
Instead of paying 3,500 the thread will have to settle from next year for a second-class apartment 2+1 4100 crowns.
"There is no hot water and heating works on solid fuel," says the finger on the new contract of his son, the man who has the power to sign.
"But I signed it anyway," he explains to you in anger and half rescinded.
The citizens' association of the apartments BytyOKD.cz, which described the new rental conditions as "immoral and indecent", advises tenants not to sign and wait until December 7, when a notice will be published to explain the method to be followed in order to claim.
But man reacts to this by a gesture of his hand.
"One says that, the other says something else" by breaking the eyebrows.
The Ostrava region becomes the deregulation laboratory.
After the New Year, this is what most apartments in the Czech Republic expect whose rents do not correspond to the market price.
Aktualne.cz has for this reason decided to visit the "laboratory" personally.
The RPG waiting room on Havirovska Street is one of four in the Ostrava region and is already full on Tuesday at 09am.
Right next to the door is a security company guard with a device to call customers.
A special button, "2011 rent", is lit on the touch screen.
A single pressure and paper with an exit number from the device.
You don't have time to read your number "157" that your number is already starting to shine on the big screen under the roof of the waiting room.
In a fraction of a second it's your turn.
After a short moment, an old couple arrives to learn about the rent, but new rents do not seem to concern people in the waiting room.
The majority of people came to solve common problems such as everywhere - demand for reparations, insurance events and others.
In the Ostrava region, more than 44,000 apartments in the portfolio of the RPG collect mails with the new leases in their letterbox since about mid-November.
RPG Byty offers rent increases from 15 to 38 percent.
the special window for new rents has been open to the public since 18 November.
"It's been running for almost a week, so it's still under trial," he responds, after a moment of hesitation, to the employee behind the window when the client becomes a journalist.
The deregulation and old Bakal minor apartments are a very sensitive local subject.
The Vice-President of the Parliament and originating in the Ostrava Lubomir Zaoralek region of the Social Democrats stated this in a sufficiently sustained manner before the elections and it now completes the local newspapers.
"20 years after them, I want a new floor."
"They didn't even change me a pot...n of iron in the toilets, it eases in the introduction the man mentioned.
However, they are mostly, according to employees, retirees who come to be sure that they will receive a retour over the new rent price if they now sign as the RPG promised in a special offer.
It is a backlog of half of the rent that will be received by the other tenants who will have signed their new contract before 15 December.
But the "deregulation" window on Havirovaska Street is not really overwhelmed by questions.
"Of the 360 customers who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 came for rent," said the employee at the shop.
And yet RPG places on its website as well as in the windows of individual rent interviews when necessary.
If both parties fail to agree on the rent it is an independent court that will make the decision.
'It's not about threats but just to inform about the unique and legitimate way to act legally,' says RPG on its website.
"No one here will go to court" thinks one of the employees of RPG Byty and the man on the street in front of the client centre gives him a reason.
"I have 13,000 Retirement Crowns and there are 5,000 Crowns left to eat, I don't have enough to go to court," he says.
The employee suddenly feels uncomfortable.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaoralek in the media demands that no one sign and therefore the people wait," she says.
The regulation of rents ends in the Czech Republic in early 2011 and increases, according to RPG Byty, are an economic necessity.
"And the current rents still do not reach the level required for the simple maintenance of the housing fund," recalls Pavel Klimes, director of the residential portfolio of the RPG Byty company, which is precisely the neglect of the housing fund that makes the tenant angry is the main reason for the increase in rent.
However, in 5 years between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able with the rents to invest in apartments 4 billion, in four years from 2011 to 2014 this is expected to make 5.2 billion.
The large screen attached to the ceiling in front of the backseats of the waiting room on Havirosvka Street, however repeats some information indicated in red.
'The increase in rent in 2011 is 15 per cent and covers no less than 31200 apartments or more than 90 per cent of the apartments of RPG'.
"It will always be up to a maximum of 7.50 Czech crowns per m2 per month," says the screen.
The increase of 38 percent concerns only 400 apartments in the portfolio of RPG.
"In these cases, it is an increase of a really very low sum 19.66 Czech crowns to m2," says RPG.
Next year the rent will remain the same for 2600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not cause a radical but progressive increase over 4 to 8 years.
It adds other commitments: all the money from the increase of rents (see Graph) is returned to apartments in the form of heating savings - new windows and heating.
Those who sign the agreement on the increase in rent have priority.
The Maternal School is also part of offices including architects.
the administrative building Avriopoint de Brno is the new headquarters of Arch. Design.
No one could have expected him to also live a mini kindergarten with all it takes - colored walls, imaginative furniture, toys and finally a miniature playground on the terrace.
Since October last year, the children of the employees of Arch. design can go there.
The architectonic project company Arch. Design, whose workshops have produced a large number of constructions in Brno, has imagined its mini-home school of enterprise since the first drafts of the Avriopoint building.
It employs about 90 people, especially from the age of making children, and it was important for women architects and project managers to be able to get back to work quickly.
At the same time as shorter employment contracts, the maternal school is a bonus offered to its employees by Arch. Design. as part of its social program.
Manufacturers and architects thus have the possibility to combine work with care for children.
It was the employees of Arch.Design. themselves who imagined this kindergarten and with the support of the management they were able to obtain an endowment from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The Mini Maternal School is funded through the European Social Fund through the operational programme of human resources and the Czech State Budget.
Thanks to funding allocations (up to 2.8 thousand Czech crowns), they were able to purchase equipment and equipment and after two years to ensure qualified personnel as well as start-up.
After the use of the funding allocation (two years) the company Arch. Design. has the obligation after 3 years to operate the mini kindergarten on its own funds.
The preparation of the project lasted one year and it was the Economy rating company that helped make the staffing application.
Child care is provided by qualified staff, a nurse and a kindergarten teacher are taking care of children all day. Children can go to kindergarten without age limitation, but they are over three years old for most.
As this is a "minimum motherhood" there can be only five children present at the same time, but during the day there are more than one child who is replaced.
The functioning of the school is flexible according to the needs of the parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use this school without regard to the hierarchical position.
Although this is individual care and education, the mini-maternal school program is comparable to that for pre-school education.
Children only play there but quality education is also provided - from the beginning to the preparation of school benches English is taught.
The class is equipped not only with imaginative toys and games but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children in society creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can at any time control their children and do not have the stress of delay to pick up children in a school away from their parents' workplace.
Parents therefore use their working time in the most productive way.
It is not surprising that there is a natural relationship of loyalty between the employee and the employer.
Arch.Design.s is thus listed among companies that offer a bonus of choice for the recruitment of new employees and who are friendly to the family and through this program reinforces HR marketing.
The bone house still fascinates after 100 years. Take a look inside Gaudi.
The roof resembles the back of a prehistoric saline, the stairwell to a dinosaur spine, and balconies to open fish mouths.
This is the Casa Battlo house in Barcelona by architect Antoni Gaudi.
Because of its organic forms, the house received from the premises the nickname of Maison en os.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stones, fragments of tiles and mosaic, facade reminiscent of scales and everywhere present of curves, that is all that is typical for Art Nouveau d'Antoni Gaudi.
The front facade of the house runs its dream lines, its pleasant colours and textures that remind nature and animals.
In a more detailed observation, the geometry, rhythm, and order are accurately thought.
In the night the facade of the house becomes even more dramatic and is lit so that the impression of brightness of the colors is reinforced.
The winding and twisting of the shapes also appears in the interiors with the same measure.
The wood vaguely copies the window frames, the balustrades, the decorative elements of the doors, the eyelet and the blades.
The Battlo house that stands in the Eixample district in the street market Passeig de Gracia in number. 43, was born from the construction of a house of 1877 of architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
The reconstruction took place for two years and the house ended in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a wealthy entrepreneur, first insisted on the demolition of the old construction and the construction of another brand new but quickly accepted Gaudi's idea of unusual and better market reconstruction.
But Casa Battlo's idea as a house with multiple dwellings was not thought by Gaudi alone.
Architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It is precisely on his project that the decorations were born for an apartment representing the owner of the building and the use of the mosaic for the facade.
For the facade also worked other artists and creators.
The common work for the plans of Casa Battlo began with a successful cooperation between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the construction of the house of Gaudi Casa Mila and Guell Park where there are other works of Gaudi.
The premises nicknamed the hot house just after its completion due to its organic forms "the House in bones".
Others, in view of the specific mechanism of opening the windows, called it "the house that dances".
It is said that at the top of the construction there is a sword similar to that of Saint Georges the patron of Catalonia.
Other sculpture elements of the construction contain hidden religious motifs.
Gaudi thought for the house a unique system in its central heating time, with air vents and typical fireplaces.
Their 45-degree inclination seems strange.
During the creation of Gaudi did not fully comply with the then construction guidelines and were not hindered by them.
At the beginning of the construction it obtained the permission from the city to build, knowing, of course, that the data on the reconstruction plans were so vague that two years later during the completion the municipal council was horrified and asked for changes.
For example, the members of the municipal council were not pleased that the pillars of the construction were trapped on the public sidewalk.
There was never a change, but, on the contrary, only 15 days after the call of the city Josep Battlo asked (and obtained satisfaction) for permission to rent the two top floors.
The owner moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a common living room and on the third there was a room and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelery.
The entire six-storey house is shared by a staircase through which you reach an independent roof terrace.
All right angles and straight lines were cancelled by the basic elements of the reconstruction and their replacement by curved walls.
Gaudi also worked on the modern concept of binding spaces.
The common part can be fully connected by opening the doors of the salons and the high society can communicate comfortably or limit itself to private space for more intimate interviews.
The house with the reconstruction of Gaudi has also received new facades a non-traditional roof and two additional floors.
The game of Gaudi with light is also impressive, blue and white glass tiles with which is decorated the inner courtyard and with the wells of lights.
The two-coloured game gives maximum light on all floors of the house.
It was simply enough to bet on the principle that the white reflects more than the dark that instead absorbs the rays of the sun.
The Casa Battlo house, which was registered in 2005 in the UNESCO World Heritage Fund, may be visited by everyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and splendid apartment accessible to the public.
The owners decided to take this step in 2002 on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They continued the visits because they found that it was a lucrative business and they expanded the field of visits to common spaces and the barn, including roof terraces.
The entry ticket in the monument is really not cheap and costs 16.50 euros; students, retirees, groups and tourist card holders have 20 percent discount.
The sum is still above the entry price in the other buildings of Gaudi in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with its fantastic towers, you must quickly find a friend among the inhabitants of the building and visit the house completely.
How to choose a mattress and a sommier: women have different criteria than men.
No ostentatory setting, but rather the quality of the area reserved for the bed, so mattress and sommier provide a real basis for a good bed.
Of course they must complement themselves harmoniously to please a particular user.
During the choice several things are decisive: the weight, the size, the age, the state of health as well as the sex of the owner.
The type of interior in which you will place the mattress and the sommier is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in the country house where latex mattresses are not continuously slept are not appropriate because they "heat" slowly.
Moreover, they have a higher weight than standard polyurethane mattresses.
They need to be returned frequently.
If they do not also have enough ventilating channels in their heart and if they also remain on a solid board, they retain moisture. Mixing can also form there.
The habit is also decisive in the choice.
He who spends the light of time abroad where very thick mattresses are frequently used with a softening layer will hardly feel well on a low and hard surface.
"This is how all hockey players coming back from NHL complain they can't sleep there."
"For their tired shoulders, feet and ribs, they needed mattresses with a tumbling layer of parsley foam."
"These mattresses are also recommended for people who suffer from diabetes who have a nervous system disorder that thus misuses the "information" of the joints and skin," says Sylva Adamczikova, who specializes in the furniture.
That's why a few years ago the mattress with parsley foam conquered hockeyists and other customers.
"Today everything goes well, Tempor, Italian Magnifex, but also Czech Tropico, for example, have suitable mattresses.
You don't need to be a guy of NHL to be able to enjoy a lazy mousse.
This "miracle" simply works.
It optimizes its stiffness and shape depending on the heat absorbed or adapts to the heat of your body.
Nothing pressures you and you won't go back in the night as after a difficult game.
You just sleep better.
The parsley foam also works as a protection against sharks.
For the choice of the mattress according to your size, add the length of the feet, approximately 21/34 cm.
A man and woman of 180cm size therefore need a bed of 210/220 cm.
The minimum width for each for a double bed should be 90 cm or 180 cm.
For single beds, for example singles, it is recommended to take at least 120/140 cm.
It's convenient in case of a visit.
'It is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when you are lying on your back you should put your hands in a comfortable way with the slightly folded elbows. Helena Prokopova, President of the Association of Bourreliers-Matelassiers and decorators who have devoted for several years to the problem of a healthy sleep and ergonomics of furniture and teaching in specialized schools.
For a double bed each needs its own mattress and mattresses, so beware, however, when choosing the height of the mattress.
Otherwise you will only be left to climb the top at different heights and this is not feasible on all bed frames.
The foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, spring mattresses at least 15 cm, of which are for the form and ventilation layer at least three centimeters.
"In touch or in position sitting on the mattress you must not feel the springs," warns Hélena Prokopova.
Each mattress requires a specific type of sommier.
The sleeping bed, when the mattress and the sommier are united like sister sisters, has nothing to do in the bedrooms.
The mattresses were very bad; we do not have to wash it, which is commonly done today.
And since during the night one normally sweats from 0.2 to 0.75 l of sweat it is clear that after 5/7 years, the mattress begins to remember a large (and capped) tamis.
For this reason, specialists refuse to make a 25-year-old claim for a mattress or life warranty.
But all to his hand.
And for this, an experience advice from the sellers: for a mattress of 120/140cm, give up, for the coating of the mattress, hygiene or washing, but add rather a protective mattress that you can easily remove and wash.
And even if today it is common to manufacture coatings with slide closures for the whole, that is to say that after opening there are two parts (for washing and the size of the washing machine is very important!) otherwise handling for large models (and for one person only) becomes when they are removed a fight between a light weight and a heavy weight on a ring.
Do you have a rigid board in your bed instead of a sommier?
Never!
Maximum for one guest bed for one night only.
However, equip the board (if there is no) of air holes and use the spring mattress with a minimum height of 15cm with sachet springs (Germany Taschenfederken) and an air layer.
A polyurethane mattress shall not be part of such a bed.
For single-position brailles with 14/18 blades, latex mattresses or sandwich fingers (maybe the combination of latex and coconut), are ideal but it will always be better for you to have a mattress with more blades, 28 and above, where the blades are folded in the lower part of the kidneys and thus it is possible to regulate rigidity.
For mattresses in several positions it is not necessary to take spring mattresses because it does not respond to changes in position.
Next to the rigidity adjustment of the blades you can also install what is called a shoulder cradle.
It is a special link of the blades that allows pressure or even tilt the blade so that the shoulder of the sleeper "integrates" well.
For men who have " shoulders as wide as the back" is really an important thing.
This is already considered by the mattress manufacturers who for the "male" have begun to use a softening area at the shoulder level.
But they also think of women - they offer them a softer surface on hips again.
For the most difficult customer there are wing or plaque tops with what is called a multi-force suspension.
Pressure spreads in more points and dilutes tension.
But of course, be careful, as soon as you use a bad pillow (large and inflated with air) on good mattresses and sommier, the "plus" disappeared.
The basic rule is a simple pillow: the pillow must support the head and its tips must reach only the shoulders, so that the muscles of the shoulders can rest.
The recommended size is 50X60 cm that Scandinavians by example prefer.
When lying on the side, the pillow must level (with the backrest of the sommier or the area softens in the mattress) the height of the shoulders.
Modern mattresses still have something in common with the first straw and grass.
Manufacturers still use natural materials or mixtures.
The trend is also bio mattresses.
Oil-based raw materials, from which polyurethane is manufactured, are replaced by natural oils, such as soybean oil.
Almost all known manufacturers use soybean.
"The Bio qualifier for mattresses means that the heart is made from natural products," explains Petr vasicek of Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used for mattress coatings; one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can add micro-capsules that develop scents of the forest or lavender.
There are differences between men and women.
While the extract of boulevard plants so that the mattress coating absorbs heat and cools the body, "refrod" the man, the coatings "heat" women.
Red pepper extract accelerates blood circulation and is therefore warmer for low sex.
The current preferred ones?
The mattresses made from cold foam (it has more pores with a disrupted cell structure therefore more breathable than the standard polyurethane and has more elasticity.
The combination of different rigidities of cold foams gives polyzone mattresses that know exactly where the head, bottom of the back and feet are.
You will pay quality mattresses from 7000 crowns and more.
Those who are characterized by their health parameters have less VAT and are taken as instruments for health.
In the Czech Republic, Gumotex has reached the top.
Saving for mattress and sommier is not simple.
From time to time, there may be special shares on the part of manufacturers or producers of two mattresses for the price of one.
Like the Magniflex company that offers Duofreeez mattresses with Memory foam sewn on the coating for 11990 crowns.
Of course we can take the second one for free.
The era of parsley or viscoelastic foams with an open cell structure and a large thickness was started with the Temper material at a "cosmic" rate.
This started as a matter for NASA because astronauts were experiencing the start of huge load factors.
The Tempor cooled to the heat and hardened, on the contrary, to the cold.
It therefore perfectly adapts to the warm human body and distributes optimal pressure.
It is ideal for this against sleeplessness and for an increase of comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses but also for health products, such as special cushions for feet that relieve legs and venous system.
Czech manufacturers, for example, use the EucathermC or Twinsaver foam or the same type.
People's tracking devices are increasingly being asked by parents who want to monitor their children.
Fear for their child leads more and more people to think about monitoring them through a GPS.
The system, set up at the beginning to search for cars can also be used to trace the movement of people and help for some cases as for example that of the little Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is currently as big as a box of matches but will soon be the size of a watch.
The case of Little Anicka has moved a lot of people and they have begun to look for ways to better protect their children.
Even if the price is to disturb their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not about espionage, but only about another way to reduce the likelihood of another tragedy," says Petr Pilin of MAcro Weil, who is one of the suppliers of trace devices in the Czech market.
"I acknowledge that there may be cases of misuse of such devices, such as putting them in the bag of someone who is not aware of them, but I have not yet met such cases."
"Most people are customers who actually buy the product for security reasons," Pilin adds.
According to him, children should always know for what purposes "the box" is used and how to use it in the event of an emergency.
The psychologist for children, Dana Bockova, draws attention to the fact that if the child does not want to wear something like this, he will get rid of it.
'Even smaller ones can show great creativity when it comes to getting rid of something when they don't want to be under control.'
"The mobile phones, which can be cut like these trace devices, have already brought the parents to long wait," says Bockova.
According to her, the fact that this type of device can help in the event of aggression is highly questionable.
"If this is a rapt prepared, the author will do everything to ensure that the child does not have an electronic device that can locate it."
"Now it's the phone."
"As soon as the tracking devices develop, they (criminals) will also look for them because the sale will be supported by an advertising campaign."
"In such cases criminals will always be ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
She also admits that such devices can help when an attack is not prepared by a pedophile.
According to Robert Cech of the company RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both cars and people, claims that having this type of device can help, even if it is destroyed in the event of an attack.
"The device may be parametered in such a way that it is in regular emission after a specified period."
"In the event that the device is destroyed, the last position of the person concerned remains anyway."
'Cheapest devices also have a tiltometer that immediately signals the position of the person who has slipped and is in an extended position without moving,' says Cech.
According to him, smart-fingered mobile phones that are equipped with a navigation system can offer a comparable service after they have formed it with a special prological.
The problem with the current tracking systems is that it is a device similar to the one used in pendants of the size of a light box or the smallest phone devices.
We can always lose them.
According to Pilina of Macro Weil, this is why tests are being conducted to make devices that look like common digital watches.
"This will have the advantage that the possible attacker will not be able to recognize the tracking device."
"Or he'll notice after a while, which will have given the police a little more time," he adds.
Whether the trace device is developed in the form of a bracelet or pendant, it will always use the same technology as to trace cars.
This is a combination of GPS position acquisition systems (which is commonly used as a self-navigation) and a mobile phone function that alerts the current position of a vehicle.
The army has so many detonating cords that it could tour the Czech Republic with, but it can only hold two years.
The army bought 445 km of cords used for explosives.
Already last year, the Ministry of Defence had purchased 224 km.
The army therefore has reserves for 225 years.
The problem is that the lifespan of the cords is two to four years maximum.
The army has purchased a total of 40 million crowns from the anonymous STV Group.
The General Staff gave the reason for the huge amount of MF DNES detonating cords that soldiers use 60 km per year.
According to the reserve calculations to be made by army pyrotechnics, which MF DNES contacted, it is clear that even generals, officers with a command, secretaries or household staff should have an explosive exercise every year.
Alexandre Vondra, Minister of Defence and Vlastimil Picek, commander of the army are no exception.
Only to argue the military's annual consumption of 60 km of detonating cords.
That distance corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
And even if it was true, the army's reserves could survive there for 10 years.
If, on the contrary, it is true that for the basic training of each of the new professionals, it is enough for more than 2 m of detonating cords, as experts say, it means that the army with its new purchase has ensured - with also the consumption of special units and engineering - of the reserves for the 225 years mentioned.
However, the soldiers of the rapid response brigade recently complained to Minister Vondra that they had almost no ammunition for their fist weapons and that shooting sessions were limited due to the need for money.
We're not talking about the lack of linen.
"And I don't get my head if they buy so much detonating cords at home."
"And that's their decision and they really know what they're doing."
"for us the army is a good client that we strive as traders to content," said STV Group Jan Decky commercial director.
Jan Pejsek, spokesperson for the Ministry of Defence, argues the purchase of hundreds of miles of detonating cords by the fact that the army will have these "munitions" in reserve for 10 years.
Jan Decky of STV Group, however, reported only four years of life of detonating cords and pyrotechnics of the police and the army of only two years.
"If they are perfectly stored in the depositions, it can go even up to four years," says one two who does not want his name published in the light of the army's criticism.
The period of time spent, each ammunition must be tested to see if it remains intact and does not threaten the life of the soldier.
However, these tests are not free and still cost money.
The other department's argument is a discount due to the quantity for 445 km of detonating cords.
"They cost us 60 percent less than last year's 245 km supply," says the spokesperson Pejsek, who makes himself the interpreter of the opinion of the buyers of the Ministry of Defence.
Only to compare: the annual consumption of the detonating cords of police pyrotechnics that neutralize the ammunition of the Second World War or those after the Soviet army does not exceed 1500 metres.
And the police always control only the amount of ammunition needed to be used before the end of their life.
This has been established for safety reasons for pyrotechnics and to be able to obtain more flexible types of more modern and more reliable detonating cords.
The Ministry of Defence today has major problems with the neutralization of tens of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Pact when the Czechoslovak army of two hundred thousand men was preparing to move, heading to the Rhine.
What awaits in a few years this Czech army that MF DNES has contacted: neutralizing hundreds of miles of old detonating cords that it now buys "in cheap".
So far, I am benefiting from contacts I have made thanks to the competitions.
The free sale of his hotel has helped Lukas Pytloun to the winner of the competition of the best individual Entrepreneur.
The winner of the first individual Entrepreneur's competition last year was Lukas Pytloun, 28-year-old.
Its adventure towards success is like in a movie.
Lukas Pytloun liked to travel.
And abroad, he realized that in Liberia he lacked a quality accommodation site at a reasonable price.
From his savings on what he had earned while working abroad and with the help of a bank loan he bought a small building of 5 apartments half demoli.
Knowing that he was still studying in the third year of higher education, he was courageous.
"The relationship between quality and the price of accommodation in our region gave me the desire to do something," said Lucas Pytloun.
He began renting the first apartment rebuilt to foreign workers.
He reinvested the profit in the building that he turned into a pension with 54 beds.
Since then, his entrepreneurial work has allowed him to open up to Liberec 4 pensions, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of about 300 beds of all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of them were until recently the four Pytloun design hotel stars.
Another of the same quality happened this year.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrova U Tise where we sold our franchise concept and other candidates for the Pytloun hotel franchise have demonstrated," the number 1 of entrepreneurs last year.
"And for the sale of the license for the operation of a large-scale hotel the victory in the competition of the contractor of the year served well, adds Pytloun with gratitude.
The victory brought him more popularity and to be known in Liberia and its surroundings.
"People recognized me on the streets, often congratulated me and, I must say, it was very pleasant," he recalls.
It recommends participation in this competition to all those who are striving to do something.
It is not necessary to win but any opportunity to be visible is good.
He says he uses his contacts and knowledge so far that he could not have gotten it in any other way.
"With those I met through the competition I began to maintain commercial relations on a regular basis.
According to him, the reputation for success has also had an impact on employees.
And it's about 70.
"I observe in their homes above all the loyalty and pride of being engaged in something that has generally been recognized."
"It is not, and by far, the only result of my personal work, but the result of a good work of all of us together.
"Only my name is pushed forward," says Lucas Pytloun with modesty.
I wish my successor a better year than we had in Farmet.
The euphoria of victory was quickly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the sense of the goal of the winner Farmet has the worst moments behind you.
The one who came to look for the price at Slovansky dum for the first place of the competition for the firm of the year organized by Vodaphone last year is Karel Zdarsky the owner of the company Farmet.
The jury rewarded the efforts with which it turned a tool shop in Ceska Skalice into a 100 million crown turnover firm.
'I can say that the reward has encouraged not only me but also my collaborators and has increased our self-confidence to fight competition', said today the winner of last year's competition.
At the beginning of the history of Farmet there was a desire to do something useful.
And so when the state offered to Karel Zdrasky's father to rent the small workshop as compensation after confiscation of property by the communists, he did not hesitate long, refused a career in a company where he worked at the time, and created a company with a few friends in his father's entourage for the manufacture of plastic baths.
Not long after they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
He became after eighteen years the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
The company was known even in the unspecialised public after the success obtained through the media.
"Not only did our customers start to know the Farmet brand better, but also the foreign partners who began to realize that they were collaborating with a company that had the biggest success in their home country," says Karel Zdarsky.
But the past year has not passed to Farmet only in the euphoria of victory.
The company's assessment was based on the 2008 and 2009 economic results.
And precisely in 2009 it was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering machines.
At the top of the crisis, which did not really affect citizens, companies were forced to stop their investment projects and start limiting their purchases of new materials and technologies.
"We have not, of course, escaped from this situation."
"The turnover fell by 40 percent, and we had to limit our production and even fireman," says Karel Zdarsky.
A viable society must know that from time to time unpopular measures must be taken.
But they managed the situation correctly and maintained beneficial results even though they were less than they had before the crisis.
However, in Farmet, they continued without compromise to invest in research and development.
"We built a training and research centre with the endowments, strengthened the company's presentation in international exhibition fairs and won the main awards in national exhibitions," says Zdarsky.
Everything makes us think that the crisis is behind them.
The numbers of posters also increase and with them the number of employees.
"To the new winner I wish this pleasant feeling of victory but in a calm atmosphere," said Karel Zdarsky.
The investigation which removes foolish regulations.
The survey on the absurdity of the year is for the fourth time part of the business clan.
Some absurd regulations could be deleted.
This year's low-glorit winner of the Absorbity of the year survey was the obligation to bring documents to the offices that officials can obtain online.
More than a third of the 4,000 voters voted for this.
For example, social affairs administrations requested a paper extract from the trade register while the grievor can obtain it in two clicks of mice.
It changes because of the investigation.
"The Czech administration of social insurance will no longer request the extract from the trade register for the payment controls of insurance," said Jana Buranova, spokesperson for the Czech Social Insurance Administration (CSSZ).
To highlight all the regulations and decrees that companies and entrepreneurs must complete in the Czech Republic and remove those who are absurd is the meaning of this Absorbity competition of the year.
This survey is still this year for the fourth time a part of the business clan organized by Hospodarske noviny and is still more popular.
If 3,000 voters voted last year, it was at least 4000 this year that they made their vote.
And it's not surprising, there are in our country the most diverse legal obligations that only slow the company down, and, more and more.
"We may be the number of documents to be completed for tax returns at first places in the world," says Karel Havlicek of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of entrepreneurial activity has become a proclaimed goal of all governments in recent years.
In comparison with the world, the situation in the Czech Republic does not improve at all.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic is 74th in terms of the conditions for the company, 8 more places compared to last year.
The competition for the Absurdity of the year was first set up in 2006 and continues each year according to the same scenario.
Anyone can report each year the administrative and bureaucratic absurdities of April by the end of September, the last time before the closing of the competition.
To report there is the website www.firmaroku.cz. Next, the contest organizer selects seven candidates for "antiprix" and lets the public vote during October on the website www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and at www.ihned.cz.
Absurdity that has received the greatest number of voices is declared to be invincible.
Until the last survey last year, it's a hundred, or more exactly 105 regulations and decrees that have lost their sense of existence.
Comments are sent by entrepreneurs but also professional unions and teachers.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, therefore, there is a requirement among the nominees, for example, that highway maintenance vehicles and fast roads pay tolls, or that contractors with twenty employees, repeat two offices and two toilets every two years.
the list of seven proposals is published on the competition website.
The announcement of the competition, which always begins in early November at the Place Venceslas in Prague, is part of a trapping in which people of political and public life regularly participate.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, director of the Association for Small and Medium Enterprises of the Czech Republic or Petr Kuzel, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, attended the culmination of the competition.
'Economic prosperity cannot work when the state puts heels in the entrepreneurs' legs and for this my goal is to delete every year at least three dozen paragraphs which today only complicate the company", said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Trade.
The effort to remove absurd decrees is not a blow in the water.
In 2007, what people did not like was the obligation of entrepreneurs to report three days earlier to the office for the individual company at the place where the company is located, the intention of going to an exhibition or a pilgrimage with a stand.
This obligation was abolished with the amendment of the Individual Business Act.
The second most lenient obligation in 2007, which was to declare to the Labour Office a service trip for a foreign employee over 30 days, was deleted with the Act on what is called the Green Card.
And everything is ok until the third session of the competition.
The 2009 Absurdity was the decree for physiotherapists to have a large mirror in their office, a refrigerator and two automatic scales.
This was changed by order of the Ministry of Health last year the obligation to have a refrigerator was removed.
A new category rewards socially responsible firms.
Environmental, humanitarian, training or sports projects are evaluated.
This year's novelty in the Hospodarske Noviny competition, which has already existed for 5 years, is the category called the Firm Responsible for 2010.
The ojective of this competition is the support of the reasonable and fair company.
"We want to support companies that monitor the impact of their company on the environment and carry out a socially responsible activity," says Patrick Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile phone operator, the Vodaphone firm, who is the guarantor and promoter of this competition, as in the case of the contest for the rebel of the year.
For this first year of this subcategory of the 2010 firm competition, organized by the firm Vodaphone, companies that have not succeeded with a single long-term objective for the company were registered.
The adventure of each of them is full of inspiration and an independent article would be to be edited.
Although the object of their business is different from one another, their support and forecast activity can be considered as the denominator of their efforts.
In one case, this applies to persons with disabilities and to the personal or health problems of their employees.
Among the fourteen finalists for the entire Czech Republic there is no example of the society of prological plagoise And Netera who supports the creation of informal sports teams of their employees who then participate in many tournaments in different sports disciplines.
Another example of a responsible firm in the Pardubice region is Isolit-Bravo, who has been the principal contributor to the staffing fund for children with disabilities for 17 years.
In caring for employees with health problems, we can also mention the old Podebrad paper manufacturing plant that employs more than 70 percent of them and, for this purpose, has obtained the title of the company Head of the Central Bohemian Region and has placed itself third in the region in the competition of the firm of the year organized by Vodaphone.
In Olomouc, MiRyz Soft, a financial company, has won for introducing flexible working hours and even reduced up to 35 hours per week on average and, without, proportionally, a reduction in wages.
The jury also earned the title because it gives priority to Czech manufacturers, supports a ditoyenne activity in the surrounding area and takes care of the environment.
"We strive to recycle as much as possible so that our business and administration have the least impact on the environment," explains Miluse Ryznarova, the executive director of society.
the company responsible IT Sign up from the Region of Usti also thinks about the health of its employees and has set them up for each laptop a chair and an ergonomic keyboard, encourages their work at home and uses the catering services of a local protected plant for its actions.
"We also support the foundation Man in the shadow that helps the local Roma community," says Ondrej Suchy, the representative of society.
In the final line, also for its activities, there is a cleaning and cleaning company in the Karlovy Vary region, which participates in the retirement insurance of its employees in the form of bonuses above standards.
"In our society we contribute to food, transport, increase qualifications and leisure," said Joseph Strapac of the bruntal Czasch construction company, a winner for the Moravia-Silesia region.
They were automatically registered in the Responsible Company category, all regional finalists for the Vodaphone Year Firm competition, which had responded to the attached questionnaires of the registration document and sent it back to the organizer before August 15.
The incomplete or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were withdrawn from the contest by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the firms in law had not answered the questions, they could not participate in the competition of the firm Responsible but were not disqualified from the "principal" competition the firm of the year Vodaphone."
"Independent registrations are not possible because it is a subcategory of the main competition of the firm of the year," explains Karel Goldman of the organization agency Bison&Rose.
At the Land Fund in Plzen, police arrested during a public competition
In the Plzen Land Fund building, the Anti-Corruption Police has been under arrest in recent days.
The detectives passed the handcuffs to the local entrepreneur and trading in Lubos real estate. G.
It had endeavoured to properly manipulate a public tender for the settlement of a refund application in such a way that the proposed land was obtained by a particular candidate.
This one was supposed to pay Lubos G. half a million crowns.
"For the moment I can only confirm that the police are pursuing a person for the offence of initiation in the context of a call for tenders and a public contest." Pravo said the head of Plzen Antonie Zelena's Public Prosecutor's Office, knowing that it is forbidden to provide more explanations because the investigation is under way.
The police released this 46-year-old contractor in freedom after 24 hours.
In order to determine how it could influence a public competition, it is only possible to speculate with so little official information.
On a question from Pravo, the Spokesperson for the Lubomira Cerna Land Fund indicated that police officers had actually arrested Plzen at a separate workplace during the public competition.
"It was a client and in no case an employee," she said.
The public competition according to Cerna has as a real name "Call to propose rights to transfer land under the Land Act" and is put in place when there are several eligible candidates in law.
"These persons propose, within the framework of the appeal, a higher value of their rights to restitutions which must be settled before the land value is announced."
"According to the proposed rights, a classification of buyers is in place and the Land Fund then transfers the land to the person who proposed the highest rights," the Fund spokesperson explained.
Lubos G. had, it is clear, information concerning persons who had registered with the appeal and as he himself, also, a beneficial person because he had purchased a large number of refund rights, he had proposed to the field candidates not to participate in the competition.
And he was probably in charge of withdrawing.
Which would explain why he had so much money in his possession at the time of his inquiry.
Lubos G. had contacts largely above the standards at the FdT (Land Fund).
It was in the case of the former Head of the FdT Vaclav Sankot, who was prosecuted for editing land for which the decision to set up a construction had already been issued.
For example, Lubos G. had obtained land for the construction of public communications, specifically in place and place where access to the Borske Pole industrial area was to be built.
Later he traded it with the city hall for a building in the historic center of the city whose value is far higher.
The city was forced to accept because otherwise it could put the construction at risk by blocking the land.
Households will pay a supplement of about 100 crowns per month for housing.
Households will have to pay a supplement from January not only for all types of energy but also for water and sanitation, heating supplies and rents will also increase in some places.
From January on, families will have to draw from their purses up to a hundred crowns per month more than they are now.
Electricity increases by 4.6 percent, the gas of almost 2 percent more expensive, in some localities you will have to pay up to one tenth more water supply and in many places central heating supplies will also be more expensive.
The increase in electricity is expected to bring the 100 crowns of more than currently to the apartment for households in the apartment.
However, all suppliers have reduced electricity prices due to the sensitive development of encouraging the production of renewable energy, including photovoltaic batteries.
Gas increases moderately but of course when people need it most to heat and thus have the greatest consumption.
So we can also count about 100 additional crowns.
While electricity and gas are increasing throughout the Czech Republic, changing the price of central heating differs from city to city.
It is mainly the largest communes that plan to increase prices.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Kraloce will pay from January for central heating almost 50 krona plus per month, families in Liberiac will pay more than 1000 krona per year.
For the inhabitants of Prague, an increase of 9 per cent for water and sanitation is being prepared in the event that the city increases the rents of infrastructure.
If the rents do not change the plagiois will pay an extra 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague will still be among the lowest compared to the whole country.
In Northern Bohemia, where prices are already one of the highest, water and sanitation increase by 7.4 percent.
Rent prices will increase, for example, significantly in the 450 thousand rental apartments from January, i.e. at the end of the regulation.
For example, CPI Byty, which owns almost 2500 apartments in Usti nad Labem, has decided to increase up to 100 percent.
Those who will not agree with the new increase in rents will be brought before the courts by the company.
Regular rents paid by people in nearly 300 thousand apartments could increase next year by 10 percent.
Czech children smell like rum and fernet. Beer is no longer fashionable and acts softly.
The fernet, rum, vodka and exceptionally also the best brand of whisky are stolen from parents.
They are drinks that most often bring those who sweat, who are not yet fifteen years old, into the doctor's hands.
Children who are treated at the hospital for recidivism do not make the exception.
This results from the experience of doctors who encounter cases similar to the admissions of the children's departments of hospitals.
"Beers or wines are no longer fashionable because it takes time to be healthy."
'The trend is really strong alcohol,' says Pravo Ludek Pelikan, head of the children's department of Horovice Hospital in Central Bohemia.
"When they manage to chip a bottle to papa in the closet, it is sometimes wisky but it is fernet and vodka that prevail."
"The vodka has this advantage that they can mix it with fruit juice and so don't feel it," says the Head of the department.
Eva Jurinova, spokesperson for the Motol hospital, also gives him reason.
"In general, it's rum or fernet."
"It's alcohol in fashion today, especially in elementary schools."
"In some cases, it was a slivovice that they brought back from the house," Jurinova added.
According to the Chief of the Pélikan Department, seeing Jewish children aged between thirteen and fourteen years old at hospital admissions is a normal phenomenon.
Before working in Horovice since last year, he was in Motol where he spent ten years in pediatrics where the ambulances brought schoolchildren from around the broads completely drunk.
"A young girl was hospitalized so four times
"She began her twelve-year career when she was brought with 3.5 per thousand alcohol in her blood with a mixture of ecstasy," the doctor described this particularly important case.
"She was at the Holesovice Exhibitions Park at a party."
"What's interesting is that it didn't seem strange to the mother that her daughter was missing 48 hours," said the Director of the Department.
It is precisely the disinterest of parents or their unusual tolerance in the face of their rejection of drinking that is the main cause of the development of children's alcoholism.
According to experts, however, there is no mention of dependency, in its strict sense, for children.
"The term alcohol is used to mean a chronic dependence on alcohol for several years with all the phenomena resulting therefrom but not found in children."
"In those who use repeated acool, it is rather a significantly unfavorable socio-family background," explained the Chief of Pélikan Department.
According to the spokesman for Jurinova, about forty Jewish children were hospitalized this year until mid-November at the pediatric clinic in Motol.
Only cases with a severe intoxication requiring hospitalization are included in the statistics.
Ivorian children who are after emergency care brought home by their parents or by the police are not counted.
In addition to the cases of children who sit and drink a bottle of alcohol after school, he excites according to Pélikan three seasonal waves with which one can count: the day of the witches, the Holy Sylvestre and the end of the school year.
"May they drink by spite after bad results or on the contrary they celebrate the start of the holidays."
"Of course I've lived on witch day a single admission of seven Jewish children," Pélikan said.
The ivy child who spent the night at the hospital in detoxification under medical control is paradoxically in a better position than the one who went home and suffered the day after the "wood mouth".
The morning headaches caused by dehydration and lack of glucose are eliminated by an infusion of glucose and nutrients that the body needs.
"They are better fighting for this because they spend an excellent evening and then a gentle awakening and nothing hurts them."
"They are only amazed at where they are," adds Pélikan, knowing that from time to time it spoils the good mood of patients at least with the note to be paid for their care.
Transportation by ambulance and hospitalization on intensive care beds can go up to tens of thousands of crowns.
"From time to time, I have applied this as a means of education by counting on these children how much their vortex has cost and they could spend all summer working seasonally to repay one evening," Pélikan added.
However, according to him, health insurance companies in their regression management, which should recover from parents the care burden, do not treat cases of Jewish children.
Two L-159 aircraft are in foreign hands in Spain for the first time.
Two L-159 of the five aircraft in all, against which the Ministry of Defence exchanged Casa C-295M transport aircraft, took off for Seville in Spain on Tuesday, where the Casa-EADS aircraft manufacturer is located.
This is the first time that such devices become the property of someone else than the Czech army.
However, they have been abroad as part of exercises or demonstration flights.
These are the biplace versions of the L-159T1 that have so far been in service in the Czech army and were in a state of flight.
The remaining three devices are single-place versions of the L-159.
They are currently staying at Aero Vodochody and the commercial intermediary - the firm Omnipol - took them into account last week.
According to Jan Pejsek of the Department of Defence, the physical departure of Vodochody's planes is currently unknown.
'L-159 single-seater aircraft have been caught on long-storied aircraft without additional charges or investment for the Ministry of Defence.'
"The L-159 T1 biplaces have been exchanged in the state," said Pravo Pejsek.
He claimed that the army will not remain without two seats, since in May 2009 the ministry signed an agreement with Aero Vodochody worth 200 million crowns for the transformation of four unused L-159 single seats into two biplaces.
The army took delivery of the first aircraft in July, the second being scheduled for delivery at the end of this year.
According to Pejsek EADS, he committed to introducing aircraft into the equipment of some of the Alliance's countries.
"In the contract it is clearly indicated that the one taking the L-159 aircraft into account is EADS and that they will serve the training of pilots from NATO member countries."
"It is therefore the case of the one who takes into account how to achieve this," Pejsek said.
Hospodarske noviny announced some time ago that the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for a Casa plane and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns was endorsed last year by the government of Mirek Topomanek.
The Ministry of Defence has not launched a bid and contacted EADS directly.
the defence management argued that the exchange ensures a future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought 72 aircraft from Aero Vodochody and only used 24 aircraft to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa planes will probably have legal implications.
However, the European Commission has filed a complaint against the Czech Ministry of Defence with the European Court of Justice because the aircraft should have been selected under a European tendering procedure and in no case by contacting a manufacturer directly.
The army has already taken delivery of three Casa planes, the last one is expected to arrive at Prague Kbely Airport in two weeks.
An index longer than the annular is a sign of low risk of cancer
Men who have the longest index than the annular are exposed to a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published on Wednesday by the British magazine Cancer.
This may depend on the level of male hormone testosterone.
"Our conclusions show that the relative length of the finger serves as a simple test of risk of prostate cancer, especially for men before 60 years," proclaimed the co-author of the study Ros Eeles, professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at Warwick University.
The finger could thus help determine which men should be tested for prostate cancer, including by combining genetic risk or other aggravating factors such as family health history, Eeles added.
During the period 1994-2009 she followed with her colleagues in Britain over 1500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time nearly three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the index of the right hand shorter than the annular.
For them as for the 19 percent of those who had the fingers of the same length, the same probability of prostate cancer was found.
However, in the case of those who had the index longer than the annular the risk fell to 33 per cent, for men before 60 years the risk decrease reached 87 per cent.
The length ratio of the two fingers cited - formed during the prenatal period - indicates in particular different levels of sexual hormones to which the child is exposed to the uterus.
Less than testosterone corresponds to a longer index.
Previous research has shown that testosterone is precisely what helps the development of prostate cancer.
The professor Vacla Paces, a renowned Czech geneticist and former President of the Academy of Sciences, told CTK that he is aware of this study but does not seem to him that the relationship between finger length and cancer is "completely demonstrated".
The Czech Republic is under the snow, the D1 and D5 motorways are closed.
Czechy like most of Europe is this Thursday morning covered by snow.
On the roads and sidewalks, most of the time of compact snow, the cutters worked all night in many places.
The D5 motorway is closed in the morning between the 89th and the 93th km towards Rozvadov due to several truck and car accidents and the D1 motorway in Brno in the direction of Prague suffers the same fate.
The dispatcher of the Central Automobile Club (UAMK) told the information
At the 91st km a truck was injured, at the 93rd two heavy loads hit, the accident injured.
Several cars also found themselves in the ditch.
The problems are also on motorway D1 at 185 km towards Prague.
Two trucks hit it.
Drivers should leave just after Brno at 190 km or go through Brno and then enter at 182 km in Kyvalka.
A row of cars of several kilometers formed at this place.
Also on the D11 motorway, there is an accident and, this, just on arrival in Prague.
In Prague, there is a snow layer of several centimeters thick, the thermometers indicate - 7 degrees Celsius.
Car lines are created in Prosek, and Sterboholska Street is also blocked.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
The trams are delayed, for example, on the line between Place Charles (Karlove Namesti) and Place de la Peace (Namesti Miru).
At eight o'clock in the morning, Prague's crisis headquarters has yet to meet.
Railways and airport are also having problems.
The Czech Railways have already had to remove because of snow 7 fast connections.
The lines for example from Prague to Kralupy or from Prague to Beroun have problems
Travelers should monitor the current situation.
Ruzyne Airport has been closed since Wednesday 11 a.m. in the night until 5 a.m.
Most roads in South Moravia are already rolling but doubling with vigilance.
On the Vyskov road, three side roads are impracticable, on the Brno road it begins to have snow gusts in places and on the Blansko road the chains are mandatory to pass certain channels of communication in the above places.
The Vyskov region was one of the most affected areas.
Until now the axes are closed: Rousinov-Slavkov, Bohdalice-Kucerov and also Saratice-Milesovice
To clean them, we may need to send snow fries and deniggers.
We can't actually estimate when they're rolling.
On the Hodonin road, caution is rigorous in the White Carpathian region.
On roads that are, in view of nature protection, maintained only by the spraying of inert products, there is still a layer of 5 centimeters of snow warned CTK.
In Chechnya, it fell between two and ten centimeters of snow; it fell most in North Bohemia, often up to 18 centimeters of snow.
In the Moravie-Silesia region, it fell up to 15 centimeters of snow.
The anxiety was gradually disappearing in Czechia.
The Americans have a new "intelligent weapon"
The U.S. Army sent a new "intelligent" weapon to Afghanistan, known only as the XM-25 code.
The generals believe that this new automatic rifle will have an influence on the conflict there with the Taliban and "will change the game" to their benefit.
The new weapon is like a super accurate cannon
Its projectiles are guided by laser with a precision of a few meters.
Special 25 mm-calibre ammunition developed for this rifle and containing a highly break-in explosive, actually works like small grenades.
Ammunition can be programmed in such a way that they will explode in contact with the target but also at any point of their ballistic trajectory.
It can therefore be used against an enemy who hides behind an obstacle, a wall or a gap.
It is also not protected from above and when it falls upon a deadly rain of steel flashes, it can also put it out of combat.
According to Richard Audette who took part in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon that uses "intelligent" technology.
"The soldier uses it essentially in such a way as to find the target, sends him a laser beam that determines the distance, obtains a specific point of focus, according to which he corrects his target site and supports relaxation.
"Let's say you've been targeting 543 meters."
"When you press the break, the weapon loads and pulls at a distance of 543 meters more or less 1, 2, 3 meters," said Audette.
400 posted jobs
The Fujitsu group relocates its subsidiary from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will be transferred to Astro Park their workplace, which is currently located in the office building of Place Mareinbader in the Bad Homburg region.
The Japanese group Fujitsu relocates his Bad Homburg branch to Frankfurt.
As stated on Wednesday, the giant specialized in computer manufacturing and maintenance, in July next year, the workplace of 400 men and women, so far on the Marienbader Square in Bad Homburg, will be transferred to Astro Park, an immense office complex located on Lyoner Straße Street at the Niederrad Quarter of Frankfurt.
A spokesperson from Fujitsu explained that in the medium term, the group is expected to bring together 100 other jobs still scattered so far in the region.
The rental offer has been extremely attractive. In addition, Astro Park's open-air offices are better suited to the employees' way of working.
In Bad Homburg too, Fujitsu was just a tenant.
The Director General, Bernd Wagner, said: "Frankfurt-Niederrad is for us a prime location with a remarkable infrastructure."
He claims that the connection to the airport is precisely of great importance to a global company such as Fujitsu.
The new move of a major business within the region sparked yesterday the joy of the winners and caused the disappointment of the losers.
The Head of Economic Affairs of the Municipality of Frankfurt, Mr. Markus Frank (CDU), said that once again, a "planetary actor" had been conquered.
It is an "extraordinary profession of faith relative to the place of implantation".
Fujitsu is suitable for the city and its implementation is an important impetus for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (the Greens), regrets Fujitsu's decision.
The management soon informed the municipality of this intention.
"It goes without saying that we have proposed our assistance to this company," said Mr. Korwisi.
However, friendly relations could not have changed to the difficulties of the computer manufacturer in the face of the owner of the building of Place Marienbader.
In the end, the economic reasons would have been decisive.
It is now a matter of avoiding such an exceptional place from being unoccupied for a long time.
"I hope that the owner and dancer of the building will be cooperative."
Ten years ago, the building of the Place de l'Hôtel de Ville, used so far by Fujitsu and the neighbouring "small vertical", as well as the rest of the buildings of the Place Marienbad, were part of the controversial construction project of the spa.
As a result of a joint project by the municipality and a private project developer, a new entrance to the city was created between the station and the City Hall. This one raises many criticisms, not only because of the impressive layout of the surfaces used in part of the parking but also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the notation and investment advice company Feri, the manufacturer of computers for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as Fujitsu, the computer manufacturer at the time still associated with Siemens, moved into the buildings.
In 2006, the German group of Frankfurt specializing in Immobilien-Chancen bought the buildings occupied by Fujitsu at the same time as the Morgan Stanley real estate fund. A year later, these buildings were resold to the Spanish company Falcon Real Estate Investments SA based in Madrid.
The Fujitsu group based in Tokyo is considered to be the third largest supplier of computer products in the world.
For example, it makes computers and servers available to businesses and also provides essential service.
Its branch established in the Rhine-Main region is one of the most important in Germany: Fujitsu certainly has more employees in Munich.
The branch, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, leaves Bad Homburg to settle in Frankfurt Niederrad. The other subsidiaries present on this site are Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this, 7000 square meters took rent in the Astro Park building.
This twenty-year old complex, whose name recalls its star-shaped plan, houses, among other things, the seat of the Confederation of Electronic and Electrotechnical Industry.
Expulsion of the server by Amazon - Threats against Mr. Assange
Wikileaks is experiencing more and more difficulties.
The Amazon Internet Service Provider has evicted from its servers the website specialized in the disclosure of confidential documents.
This attitude may conceal political pressure following the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr Assange, apparently lives in England.
In the United States, the Wikileaks site is being attacked with ever greater force.
The cyber-activist group Wikileaks no longer has access to its server hosted so far in America and is now looking for a hostel in Europe.
Meanwhile, the eminent U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman called the other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, who is sought by Interpol, is probably staying in Britain, according to information published by newspapers.
"Wikileaks is excluded from the Amazon server."
"Freedom of expression in the country of freedom" reported on Wednesday (local time) cyber-activists at the origin of revelations via the social network Twitter.
Earlier, the cyber-enterprise, Amazon, had deleted Wikileaks documents from its servers.
Following the publication of secret diplomatic notes, cyber-activists used the Amazon Web Service (AWS) in order to achieve the greatest number of access to documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks continues his revelations: "Great, our dollars are now spent caring for people in Europe."
When freedom of expression poses a problem to Amazon, "they should stop selling books."
The television channel CNN, citing Mr. Liebermann's office, reported that Amazon prohibited Wikileaks from using its servers after the investigation by Senator Joe Lieberman's collaborators.
The chairman of the Senate Commission for the Protection of the Territory had threatened the Amazon site to orchestrate a boycott against it, reported the British newspaper, "The Guardian".
"I wish that Amazon would take this action earlier with regard to previous publications by Wikileaks for classified information," the honourable senator said.
At the same time, Mr Liebermann called on other countries to refuse the use of servers by the platform.
"Wikileaks acts unlawfully, monstrous and unscrupulously, thus endangering our national security and endangering life all over the world," according to a communiqué from independent senators.
"No company aware of its responsibilities, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks disseminate the content of stolen documents."
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr Assange, who is sought by the Swedish authorities because he is suspected of rape, is listed on the list of persons sought by Interpol.
According to information broadcast by the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian lives in Britain and Scotland Yard know exactly where he is.
The cyber-activist has consistently described as intrigues orchestrated by its detractors the prosecutions brought against him by Sweden.
The spokesperson for Wikileaks, Kristinn Hrafnsson, told London that threats had been made against the site.
"Calls have even been launched for the murder of Julian Assange."
That is why Assange is particularly concerned about his safety, Hrafnsson said.
That's also why Wikileaks' founder continues to hide.
Hrafnsson evidently responded to statements made in North America.
In America, former Republican Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, demanded that Wikileaks' revelations be prosecuted and executed for treason.
In Canada, the Chief of Government advisor Mr. Stephen Harper stated on television, obviously ironically, that Mr. Assange should be "killed" and that Mr. Obama could "use a Drone."
During this time, a controversy broke out between the White House and Mr. Assange.
Robert Gibbs, spokesperson for the U.S. President, Barack Obama, described as "ridiculous and absurd" the fact that Mr. Assange demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hilary Clinton if he was responsible for the order given to diplomats, and recently disclosed, to engage in espionage activities.
"I don't know exactly why we should deal with the opinion of an individual who owns a website," said Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than the assertions of a website."
The U.S. government now completely passes to the test bench the protection of its databases.
According to a White House communiqué, Mr. Russell Travers, Deputy Director of the Counter-Terrorism Centre, was appointed responsible for combating leaks.
Mr. Travers is responsible for establishing "the necessary structural reforms" which were made essential after the disclosure of diplomatic cables by Wikileaks.
The White House also has the desire to verify the means by which the entire administration exchanges and protects the information.
In addition, the U.S. government announced that it wanted to take care of the security of dissidents and militants if they were ever threatened by Wikileaks' revelations.
"We have done everything we can to get in touch with them," said State Department spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if necessary."
The University of Glace
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice confectioners are prepared for the best seasons of the year.
The three-day initiation course organized for future glaciers has been very successful and attracted to visitors from all over the world.
Where does the whole ice come from?
Glacier and ice machine.
The glacier, i.e. in German the ice confectioner somewhat out of modernity, manufactures cream according to all the rules of Italian ice making art.
The ice turbine removes ice cream from the refrigerated window using a spatula, disposes it in the hole and then starts selling it.
To find out, we do not need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wishes to know more about the ice can't avoid "Gelato-University" from the Italian company Carpigiani.
The sorbeter manufacturer founded the ice university in 2003 to ensure that ice creams from its machines respond everywhere to the high Italian ideals.
The three-day initiation course for future glaciers has been very successful and attracted to visitors from around the world.
Special courses on chocolate ice are also offered and extend over several days. Also, practical sessions are organized in private ice cream.
In the middle of the quarantine crisis, a number of people dream of a new career, others are simply at risk of realizing their burning desire on the smooth ice.
This time, there were 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia through Hungary.
Jacky, professor of artistic education from California, is a member of the Slow Food movement. He wants to propose in the future a quality European product in the country of the Industrial Ice.
Anke from Berlin is a business manager and she wants to get a few things out of this challenging job for nerves after a few years.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening a glacier in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil would like to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian cleaning woman came because her children love Italian ice cream.
The glacier master Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal characteristics of perfect ice.
It is decisive not only good flavor, but also silky flexibility and good consistency.
However, Luciano does not forget during the formation the cherry on the cake of the national superstructure and, in general, of the south: "The Italian ice is simply the best: and then it retains a sacred dose of romanticism."
The first step in manufacturing seems to be quite simple.
Luciano pours the basic ingredients, such as milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large blender that heats up to 85 degrees with an electronic program, then cools immediately to four degrees.
It then opens a tap installed on the machine: a white, pasteurized base cream comes out, based on all kinds of milk ice.
The trainer is immediately assailelli of question: Is it possible to manufacture ice using only natural substances without stabiliser?
How can we give free course to the personal pleasure of the experiment?
Mr. Luciano warns against being misled by the spirit of time.
The one who speaks only of ice "made from natural ingredients" may have even used stabilizers: most often a natural product, e.g. guar seed flour obtained from guar beans.
Of course it is possible to manufacture ice without using stabilizer, it only needs to be sold within 24 hours, otherwise it collapses and the customer will crunch nothing but ice granules.
Certain changes in the base mass are permitted.
This becomes more exciting with aromas.
Master Luciano makes the difference between the ingredients that are acquired in the fruits or confectionery of the supermarket.
In addition, there are powder and pasta.
"Suppliers will all try to protect you from dozens of flavoured ingredients."
"However, you should just try."
Either in sorbet recipes with sugar and fresh fruit.
Either in ice creams made from the white base mass that, by adding eggs into it becomes a yellow cream and, when added of cocoa powder, constitutes the basis of all possible chocolate desserts.
Now, all participants in the course must move on to the use of ice machines.
Luciano invites them from time to time to make four types of ice: vanilla, chocolate, moka and hazelnut with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla flavour or other natural ingredients.
The various types of fruit ice are also subject to the same experience.
More aromatic substances, more fruit purées: from the point of view of taste, this is not absolutely better.
The hazelnut ice does not necessarily include the taste of the nut, when it consists in a large part of hazelnuts.
The Kiwi ice, very popular, is made from the group using more fruit, less water and a little less stabiliser.
"Only a balanced mixture properly reflects the taste of an ice," says Luciano.
Ice manufacturing is a calculation exercise: if you use fishing purée with a lot of sugar, you need to reduce the amount of sugar in the basic recipe.
A sugar supplement is required for lemon ice.
Luciano presents an apparatus with which he determines the sugar content of the different types of fruit (the vineyards use it to measure the degree of Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables make calculations easier.
The manufacture of ice no longer requires, as in the past, as much physical intervention.
It is not only the machine for the automatic manufacture of the base mass that helps.
There is also a device in which the mixture of ice is simultaneously beaten available to make it hollow and reduced to negative temperatures.
Despite all automations, light tires are not excluded.
Brazilian Gustavo shaves from fruit purée from head to foot and thus crushes his fellow students when control of the colossal blender bowl escapes him.
Master Luciano is of the opinion that "such an incident may occur in each course: it is only a matter of time."
The controllers in an ambiguous position
According to some sources, the industry that experimented with the cultivation of genetically modified plants has undermined the European Food Safety Authority.
This charge is now made by the Expert Group Testbiotech, which is considered an independent institute for the assessment of the consequences of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we're well informed," said Munich M. Christoph Then, Director of Testbiotech on Wednesday.
Some reports indicate that the president of the Efsa group for genetically modified plants, Mr. Harry Kuiper, and other Efsa experts are under contract with the Ilsi pressure group.
The latter is funded by groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé or Bayer.
Mr. Kuiper has been instrumental in developing the Efsa test requirements for genetically modified plants and is therefore clearly in a conflict of interest situation, according to Mr. Then's criticism.
The requirements laid down in paragraphs correspond in text to the positions of the Ilsi pressure group and thus bear the industry's trade mark which, in essence, would be controlled by the authorities installed in Parme in Italy.
This is already the second time that Testbiotech denounces a conflict of interest.
An Efsa senior officer recently joined the Swiss agri-food group Syngenta without condition or transitional period. In doing so, she changed camp.
A short time ago, even Central German Radio (Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk, MDR) had revealed the existence of personal relations between the European Union's supervisory authority and the industrial lobby, which raised the suspicions of both the German Federal Environment Agency and European Members.
However, the Efsa does not admit that there is any conflict of interest.
An opinion indicates that all reliable data, including those of industry as long as they are of good professional quality, are used.
Experts working on behalf of the Efsa are not prohibited from contacting this business sector.
But they should make them public.
Mr. Kuiper admits that he works for the International Life Sciences Institute based in the United States.
This body considers itself to be a neutral forum that brings together experts who, among other things, belong to the field of science, industry and policy in order to assess the risks of biotechnology without being the balance of a lobby.
In this case, independent experts such as Mr.Then disagree with the fact that genetically modified plants are accepted without food testing in animals and that the impact of these plants on the environment has not been tested.
"We want to know, for example, what are the impacts of genetically modified maize on the field," said Mr.Then.
The current practice is to test only isolated proteins and not all genetically modified plant, which does not allow for reliable results.
"If we don't look for the risks, how can we find them?" asks Mr.Then on a tone accuser.
That is also Mrs Angelika Hilbeck's point of view.
This scientist has been doing research since 1994 in the field of genetics and is currently working at the Zurich Polytechnic School.
In this region as well as in the United States, and now also in Europe, the industry is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists.
That is why there are hardly any researchers who are not related to societies.
In the company's view, critical studies would not be published.
Ms. Hilbeck said that "industry controls security research".
The stone trail
Uli Gsell obtained a total of 400 kilos of it.
Monday afternoon, she was in front of Stuttgart train station with her back tube.
There was a manufact.
It was snowing.
History is known: In September, the excavators had come and had begun to demolish a large part of the northern wing.
The world of Stuttgart was no longer the same: several thousand people have demonstrated against the S21 project, the transformation of the central station of Stuttgart into an underground station that will cost several billion.
Much of the wing was in ruins when the demonstrations led to the stopping of construction work.
Broken into 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
The Muschelkalk (the coquillier limestone) of Crailsheim, a soft and coarse pavement that was poorly built between 1914 and 1920.
Mr. Gsell is a 43-year-old sculptor living in Ostfildern.
He's been looking for a few fragments.
"These stones are relics."
"They must not disappear."
He enthusiastically declared: "a modest and cheap rock, simple and earthly."
He claimed that by cutting it off at the saw, he felt the smell of cigarette smoke.
He does not yet know what he will do with this fragment.
The rocks have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
Stuttgart's stone traces lead to a former French army munitions deposit in a forest near Tubingue, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
This 44-year-old man trades old stones.
He bought all the stones from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were defeated or disappeared in the landfill," he said in his office in a hut, which was once a guard post.
He reports that he was subjected to insults and threats when in September the newspapers reported that he had purchased the rest of the northern wing from the demolition company.
But he negotiated with the opponents of the S21 project for a full day.
And he explained to them that he could do nothing at all to oppose the demolition.
And if it happens, then the most reasonable thing would be to continue using the stones.
About 200 opponents of the S21 project subsequently carried one of the 80-kilometer stone parallelepipede weighing an average value of between 6.50 and 14 Euros.
Some keep it as a remembrance in all, hoping to also make it when rebuilding.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, 25 full shipments of a truck.
About half of them are still trapped in the forest, with the rest being sold for a long time.
Garden owners, landscape gardeners, particulars.
They came from all over and took everything that could get into the trunk and trailers.
These scandal stones in Stuttgart have long changed to "Mäuerle" or to limitations of grass-bands.
"Well, that stone is nothing special," said Rongen.
"wasn't this political component."
He enters his car all land, turns around his vast empire of 20 hectares.
He went through legal studies that he had abandoned, and later he began to study biology before he became interested in computer science and eventually became a career.
And a stone lover.
He's stocking 40,000 tons.
He loves his treasures all over Germany.
He claims to be the greatest merchant of ancient stones.
He's coming back.
Sand stones carved with art are laid on the snow.
"In the past, they were part of the Marienbrücke Bridge in Dresden."
Does Elbsandstein, yellow, hot, assert with enthusiasm.
"My favorite stone."
He takes the path that goes through the forest.
It shows a lot of finger: red sandstone, formerly part of Karlsruhe station.
And so on.
"Jolio travertine."
The parallelpipepede was once part of the Neckarstadion of Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow of stones and stories, the cannstatt travertin from the police prefecture, the red granite from the Saint Blasien Cathedral, the tuf from the Heilbronn Hospital.
What a job, what efforts, what a sweat!
When Mr. Rongen thought that the stones were once hand-cultivated and moved with simple palates and carriages drawn by oxen, he became quite respectful.
"This would be a scandal if such a heritage was put in place."
He didn't get rich, even less rich.
But today this career employs 14 people. In addition, stone cutters, a sculptor, a forgeron, a glass blower and a gardener settled in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's rewarding," says the waste recycler.
Next thing you know, he has to go to Cologne.
There are also stones there to save.
Skill struggles to conquer the high potential
The counter has a living flow.
16 students shop to buy small salmon bread, tomato sauce and white-eaters.
The technical university of Braunschweig and the automobile manufacturer Volkswagen invited students in design and mechanical engineering to a workshop.
As part of a sort of competition of ideas, they need to talk business about the future car with VW designers, and, by the way, to know the Volkswagen firm.
Today, many companies do not hesitate to go to the body in the competition to denigrate better brains and to engage, like Volkswagen, in multiform cooperation with universities.
Their mission: To recruit the most gifted graduates as much as possible in the amphitheatres before they arrive on the job market and not be courted by others.
And since universities do not publish statements about the performance of their students, one tries to identify the exceptional talents in practical projects and to engage them.
On the second day of the workshop organized at the technical university of Brauschweig the automobile group loves talent.
A young lady in the staff service shares pens, candy and cards with the Volkswagen logo.
She talks about the calendar of professional internships and student jobs for young talent; she shows them the ways to get to the entrance of the group.
Nico Selle from the technical university of Braunschweig is responsible for the project undertaken with Volkswagen.
For him, there are reciprocal advantages for both parties: "Students come into contact with this industrial sector and gain experience."
"As for the Volkswagen group, he can get to know the students, look more closely at the serious candidates and appreciate those who come into line as a collaborator."
According to Mr Selle, such cooperation is unusual.
What's new is the offensive we're trying to attract students with.
"At times, the focus was on the professional project," said Selle.
The struggle for the conquest of new graduates will be much closer.
In many sectors, companies are no longer able to recruit their employees by sorting on a kirielle of candidates.
But they must boast their reliability and above all shorten the highly skilled labour force.
They are mostly Graduates from engineering lines that are in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the German engineers' association VDI, more than 40,000 engineering positions remained unoccupied in October.
And according to VDI's forecast, the gap in engineering positions will be further widened.
Roman Dykta goes to talent hunting on behalf of KPMG, audit firm, accounting expertise and advice.
It organizes costly events to recruit talent, such as the KPMG-Race cruise race, a kind of paper rally where competitors need to find their way through GPS coordinates.
The company will send eight promising students next year to travel this way to the United States.
Participants can visit KPMG's subsidiaries and know about the company.
The participant shall decide in advance after two selection procedures.
Only the cream cream of the many candidates will fly for the United States.
According to Mr Dykta, the means used for seeking high potential in universities are increasingly important.
"We want to emerge from the lot through the cruise race."
"For us, a simple cruise was too little."
For the talent hunter Mr. Dykta, the account seems to be there.
"Until today, we have remained in contact with all those who participated last year in a similar action."
"Some of them are about to finish their studies and want to send their requests to our company soon," he says.
Apart from the direct softening of campuses, small and medium-sized enterprises proceed in a classic way by participating in the professional fairs where they engage in brain hunting.
"We try to reach the graduates by participating in the trade fairs."
"For example, at the solar technology fair," says Sitha Stübe, Human Resources Director at Solarworld, a manufacturer of photovoltaic panels.
The company is located in Bonn and employs about 1500 people in Germany.
Ms. Stübe was aware of the issue of succession.
Currently, 35 positions are being put into competition on the company's website.
"At the moment, it is very difficult to fill vacancies."
"It costs a lot and takes a lot of time," he says.
Another way to establish contact is to go through university professors.
Solarworld has established cooperation with various higher education institutions, for example, the University of Fribourg.
"Teachers indicate that the student has the opportunity to conduct professional internships or write his final study project at home."
Onerous advertising campaigns are being announced among solar specialists.
This is why the company tries to advertise by highlighting other qualities: personalized atmosphere, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
"Of course, a large group cannot do that," said Stübe, chief of staff.
Money has long been losing its primary role in job research.
Flexible working hours, child care, or good promotion opportunities are the other determining factors.
According to a study conducted by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld occupies 55th place among the 100 best employers in Germany.
The Institute is an annual honour table for German employers.
To this end, he interrogates the employees on the degree of satisfaction with their work and context, while looking at the framework conditions of employees.
The head of staff Ms. Stübe hoped that this placement would enhance the image of the company with job seekers.
"I think the candidates are particularly referring to external evaluations with regard to a potential employer," she said.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of German Academy DEBA (Deutscher Employer Branding Academy, DEBA) advises companies who wish to build a good reputation as an employer by applying a long-term strategy.
He advises his clients to show more authenticity.
And, according to Mr Kriegler, this means first and foremost taking internal measures.
"The best way for an employer to become attractive is to go through his own employees," he says.
This is called, according to the jargon used in the sector, the internal image strategy, i.e. the creation of the employer's brand image within its own workforce.
"collaborators are happy to form the best messengers."
When employees are well treated and identified with the company, they themselves advertise their employer to their friends and acquaintances.
"It's like playing in an orchestra," said Mr. Kriegler.
Obama puts a stop to new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida, a state in the south-east of the United States, in the coming years.
The Washington Government has issued a ban An equivalent ban, and thus ultimately annulled its initial plans.
Even off the Atlantic coast, new drilling remains currently prohibited.
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar made this announcement Wednesday.
It is the explosion in April of the "Deepwater Horizon" drilling platform that causes this strict ban, which must remain in force for at least the next five years.
Faced with this life-stricken accident that led to the greatest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and the industry, indicated that he was willing to allow for new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
In this way, supporters of this solution want to reduce the reliance of the United States on foreign countries in terms of oil supply.
The question of who bears the responsibility for the devastating black tide in golf is not, to date, definitively resolved.
The British oil group, which is facing multi-billion compensation claims, is at the heart of the charges.
A commission of inquiry created by Obama must present its findings in December.
In October, the secretary at Interior Ken Salazar lifted the ice from the forage decreed after the explosion of the platform.
Following this decision, various oil groups had already submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With stricter controls and stricter safety instructions, Obama and Salazar want to prevent a new disaster.
The competent supervisory authority, which has discredited itself after numerous charges of corruption, is currently being thoroughly reformed.
At the same time, Mr. Obama announced that he would eliminate the profit-making tax niches of the gas and oil groups.
The players in this sector are now publicly warning against the fact that the supply flow in the Gulf would be significantly lower than so far.
"The government's goal is to put a brake on the rapid growth of the gas and oil sector" according to the result of a current BDO audit survey in the sector, prior to the ban on drilling issued on Wednesday.
Moreover, the American Energy Alliance deplores the uncertainty that characterizes this sector: "No one knows what will change exactly with the regulation."
Investments in new support projects have been postponed until further notice, to the detriment of growth.
The country Ogoni is dry
The water that flows into the rivers is brown oil; it produces a smell similar to that in the gas station: Due to a leak, billions of litres of crude oil destroyed the country of Ogoni in Nigeria.
Men live from theft, corruption and oil refining.
Celestine Akpobari has a good intention.
"Don't wear yourself out," throws the ecologist activist to the journalists to calm them: "You still have enough oil mud in front of the water lens today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian tried to photograph a young girl deep in the mud water up to the chest, as well as the fat drag around her: This scene seems almost beautiful in the burst of water in the color of the rainbow.
It cannot be seen that the basement is filled with brown crude oil mats.
On the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River, Esther Badom reports that, at times, she collected shrimps by whole buckets here.
But in the meantime, the calm waters are completely tarried.
Five years ago, a huge amount of oil has flown from an oil pipeline that exploded in the vast marsh.
Fishermen living in the nearby town of Bodo now have to travel for six hours to reach the fishy waters: The Ogoni country in the heart of the Niger Delta is considered one of the most polluted regions in the world.
All the extent of the ravages jumps to the eyes as we travel through the marshes of mangrove crossed by streams of water.
Instead of a clear water, the motor boat cracks a brown cradingue water. Anyone who dives in its hand takes away any oil cover.
The roots of small mangrove emerge from the soil as brittle sticks. The isolated palm trees are sad to hang their palms.
We are looking in vain for the clouds of birds, as wetlands usually meet: Since the outboard engine stops, a ghostly silence falls on this paradise of ancient times that resembles a service station by the smell it smells.
"This is a war against the environment," said Celestine Akpobari of a sad air: "Our life is characterized by a permanent danger to health."
The comparison of wars is made.
The region where the Ogoni live is a battlefield besieged for decades: More than 60 years ago, the first European explorers entered here; the first resistance was organized in the 1980s by writer Ken Saro-Wiwa. it was executed later. In 1993, Shell Group had to stop its production activities in this region because they had become very dangerous for its employees.
Today, the return to the Ogoni country is prohibited from this company: While more than 2 million barrels of black gold are pumped daily thanks to over 5000 drilling wells and 7,000 kilometres of oil pipelines throughout the Delta region, three times as large as Switzerland, the Ogoni oil fields are unexploited, because the situation is too unstable for this oil group.
All a few hundred meters stand in the water of steel tiles as strange sculptures: The heads of drilling holes are very affectionately referred to as "Christmas trees".
They are up to 50 years old, most of them are torn by corrosion to the spot.
Akpobari estimates that a forage head of this nature breaks off from time to time in pieces, because a constant stream of crude oil flows into the water.
According to the experts' estimates, more than two billion litres have spilled over the ecosystem in 50 years: Each year, the amount of oil equivalent to that which has flown into the sea during the accident of the super-petroleary "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago off Alaska, one of the greatest environmental disasters in human history.
Who is responsible for persistent environmental pollution? The answer to this question divides the actors.
For the Shell group, the sabotage and silencing of pipelines are responsible for more than 90 percent of pollution. Environmentalists, for their part, consider the explosions of drilling heads and perforated pipelines as the main causes.
In 2008, U.S. researcher Richard Steiner challenged Shell Group to apply essentially less stringent safety standards to Nigeria than anywhere else in the world: Only the failure rate of the pipelines is still much higher than all other standards.
Some forms emerge from mangroves in a place that, seen from a distance, resembles an abandoned workshop, full of trucks and installed in the open air: They are completely bare and covered with cambours up to the neck.
A fire sparks under one of the many tonsets that sometimes connected to pipes, sometimes scattered without reason on the site must be noticed: a small underground refinery.
We heat crude oil in the barrel for several hours, explains Michael, the team leader.
At first, the gasoline penetrates into a container passing through pipes, then at the end of the conduction of the drops of kerosene fall and we finally get the diesel.
This is how Michael and his four collaborators produce daily four 300-liter Diesel barrels: "This brings us 34,000 Naira", about $22.
The people of the Delta took advantage of the chronic shortage of fuel in the largest oil-producing country in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
Illegal refiners can sell at a cheaper price than the ridiculously low price of just 40 cents of Euro per litre of Diesel: For they acquire their raw material free of charge.
It is offered by the "protectors" that put the pipeline network into perce throughout the Ogoni country. According to experts, the country loses at least 16 million litres of crude oil in the entire Niger Delta.
Only a very insignificant small part of the provisionally stored raw material is unlawfully purified: Organized crime networks, which are also among its members of high-ranking politicians and soldiers, charge the lion's share in tanks and the brewing on the world market.
Activist Akpobari believes that the debate on whether to attribute the environmental disaster or rather subversive activities to the population or to the mode of laxist production is purely academic.
"If oil companies were not perceived as intruders and if the foundations of the life of fishermen were not so deeply destroyed, there would be no sabotage, theft and illegal refineries."
In the meantime, however, the Ogoni's relations mainly with Shell have deteriorated so much that it was only a question of withdrawal of the group. "Maybe operators with other nationalities, such as Chinese, will prove to be better."
So Michael gets nervous.
"It's a long time you're going to get rid of" announces the robust oil worker.
"The soldiers may appear at all times."
If the illegal refiners are surprised by the special units of the armed forces, they will not be arrested, but at the very least they will offer them wine pots.
Even soldiers mostly from the north of the country intend to enjoy the raw material as all Nigerians do.
"In all respects, this damn thing has brought our country down very low," Akpori regrets.
Investigators discover construction defects in A380 reactors
The A380 clearly suffers from a major security problem.
By examining an aircraft that has made an emergency landing, the investigators have discovered a possible lack of construction that can lead to "catastrophic failure of the reactor."
The airline Qantas now wants to file a complaint against the reactor manufacturer.
In early November, Airbus passengers belonging to the company Quantas had so far been more fortunate: In the course of its investigation, the Australian Air Safety Authority found that the reactors of some A380 aircraft had a serious security problem, and it cautioned against a possible lack of construction.
This potential failure could lead to serious consequences: It can cause fatigue cracks and leaks in the connection of the oil pipeline, it is indicated in a published position this Thursday by the administration of the ATSB.
It could have led to a "catatrophic failure of reactors".
Rolls-Royce and 20 aircraft of the A380 series are concerned.
The Quantas Airbus Company, which had to land urgently on November 4 in Singapore, is among them.
The Australian airline has now initiated prosecutions against the English reactor manufacturer.
She filed a judicial complaint with an Australian federal court based in Sydney, which gave her the opportunity to take other legal measures against society.
The director of Quantas, Alan Joyce, said his company would claim damages in connection with the incident in early November.
Parts have been detached and the bearing surface has been damaged during the engine fire.
According to Rolls-Royce, it is the inflammation of oil that is the cause of the damage.
After this incident, at least 40 reactors now need to be replaced in the world.
Australian investigators have announced that further safety tests will be carried out on superjumbos that are also equipped with the reactors in question.
The safety recommendations are the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ASTB spokesperson Martin Dolan.
The security problem is considered important enough to inform all parties concerned.
After the emergency landing of his plane, the airline Quantas had fixed its entire fleet of A380 for a week on the ground.
Singapore Airlines has temporarily immobilized three of its eleven A380.
The Lufthansa company replaced, as a precautionary measure, the reactor of an A380.
The two-storey plane is the world's largest line aircraft.
The fall of snow all over the territory causes chaos in transport
Germany all covered with white: In one night, the snow fell on almost the whole country.
The chaos reigns on all roads, trains and planes are immobilized.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
Winter makes Germany grate: By glacial temperatures, almost the entire republic is covered with snow on Thursday night, which leads to chaos in many localities.
In the north and east, snow cover reaches 15 centimeters per place.
Traffic is highly restricted on several highways and on many roads.
On National A7 in Flensburg, winter service staff worked on an ongoing basis, but they were unable to complete the snow which continued to accumulate.
In addition, violent gusts have swept the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Office for Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (DSH) expects this sea-race to take place on the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein with water levels up to 1.2 m above normal.
Snow masks on highways and federal roads have caused serious problems in Saxony.
This is why the weather warning plant Weather announced the level of violet alert was announced in Saxon Switzerland: in fact, it is the highest level.
In places, there fell 30 centimeters of fresh snow that the strong and fresh winds scattered.
Several trucks and cars were stuck there at night.
Even in the Saxony-Anhalt, the police authorities announced serious road disturbances.
On the A2 motorway, snow and wind caused an interruption of the traffic and caused the plugs.
In Thuringe, snowfalls affected highways A4 and A9.
According to Deutscher Bahn, serious disruptions of rail traffic occurred in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringe and north of Bavaria.
The main problems are the snow on the railways, the trees falling on the railroads, the catenars or the destroyed needles.
In Saxony, we had to stop interregional transport Leipzig-Nuremberg.
In Sallfeld, Thuringe, a ICE train to Munich had to stop.
The firefighters and paramedics had to supply the 165 passengers on the train in blankets, food and drink.
Snow winds swept the roads.
Snowfalls have resulted in many flight cancellations at major airports in Germany.
According to a standard spokesperson and flight information, some cancellations are already announced in Munich.
A Fraport spokesperson indicates that 40 flights have already been cancelled in Frankfurt on the Main.
The winter service provides a permanent service.
It is true that passengers stuck at the airport are no longer numerous, although only 400 beds are available there.
Accidents occurred Wednesday afternoon on many roads.
In the evening in Ostholstein, a truck driver lost his life during a collision with a train at a level crossing.
The train driver was slightly injured.
Due to snow layers on the roads, a similar accident occurred not far from Nuremberg: even here, a truck was hit at a level crossing because the vehicle was immobilized there.
The driver has lost his life.
Four passengers were injured on the train, which is why the road from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was closed until morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died when her car ran a tonne on a slippery pavement in Aschaffenburg.
However, the meteorologists announce good news: The snow will always be soft and powdery, but it will murky in the event of slight gusts.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea will be plagued by violent and rapid winds.
It is very cold, however, up to 15 degrees per place.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin tours.
The Deutsche Bank seeks to separate itself from its emblem: According to information reported by newspapers, this financial institution seeks buyers for its two office buildings located in Frankfurt.
This building could bring up to 500 million Euros.
The Deutsche Bank just embellished the group's headquarters: The twin towers in the business district have been modernized; in the meantime, the bankers had to return to their former place of service.
In the future, the financial group clearly seeks to recover the costs of renovations and seeks a buyer for its two buildings, as the Financial Times Deutschland newspaper states, citing a spokesperson.
This Spokesperson did not indicate the reasons for the planned sale.
He said, "We're checking whether it's more interesting to take care of the buildings or sell them, and to reschedule them later."
This is how Germany's largest financial institution has already transferred its seat, shortly thereafter.
It was only in mid-2007 that the bank acquired the twins for an amount of EUR 272 million from the own funds holders, and then rehabilitated them.
Energy optimization transformations have, according to some indications, taken up approximately EUR 200 million.
A sale would obviously bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to information provided by the newspaper, experts in this business sector estimate the value of the towers, renamed in the meantime "Green Towers", to about 500 million Euros.
According to the Spokesperson, it is not currently known whether the buildings will be sold again to a bank or an independent investor.
Thousands of people mourn the children who have died.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people had a thought for minors who were reported dead as a result of several explosions in a mine.
We had not yet been able to climb the bodies because the security situation of the dead well continues to be precarious.
Just two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred at Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 minors between the ages of 17 and 62 had been buried underground.
A probe had been introduced into the dead well, but no trace of survivors had been discovered.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, no relief team was able to descend into the mine for security reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and the administration considered that minors no longer had a chance to survive.
Until now the bodies could not have been lifted.
Today, parents and friends have organized a party in memory of the dead.
Thousands of people had gathered in a sunny sun in Greymouth south of New Zealand.
They observed two minutes of silence.
In memory of the 29 minors, 29 tables were installed on which names, helmets and lamps could be seen.
Photos and personal effects, including surfing clothes and boards, also had their place.
The flags were put in Bern before all the public buildings in the country.
New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told participants at the commemorative celebration that New Zealand had hoped that minors would rise to the surface.
"But they never came home."
Mr. Lawrie Drew whose son Zen was buried in the pits said he cannot resign to accept his son's death until he has seen his remains.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the commemorative celebration.
Juveniles of South African and British origin also survived the first explosion on 19 November.
The rescuers began to extinguish a fire inside the coal mine on the South Island of New Zealand.
Police Prefect Gary Knowles told journalists that when explosive gas masses are moved, burning temperatures inside the mine are starting to fall.
Go to hell, warrior!
Is Splatter an artificial film?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the limits of the ancient genre thanks to his film, "Walhalla Rising", epic of the fighter.
What audience did Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think about turning "Walhalla Rising"?
A Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) with only one eye is taken prisoner; he frees himself from his brow and, with almost supernatural force, eliminates his opponents after each other. This seems ideal for young male spectators in search of bloody action, precisely because our hero uses brutal methods of murder. When he is in a bad mood, he rips off the intestines of his enemies without waiting for them to die.
On the other hand, until the end of the film, the village says no words about its real name. Even the other characters let escape, at the very least, at the back of one or two phrases a few fearful cries of agony.
Otherwise, there is nothing said and there is a feast in the incredibly beautiful mountain landscape of Scotland, which is the setting of the Viking universe about a thousand years ago.
It would be ideal for mature filmmakers with an interest in existentialism and excellent travel.
When a film targets several target groups, it is a shame that they exclude each other.
The director Winding Refn has been regarded, since the publication of "Pusher", his trilogy concerning the drug dealer and full of style, as a kind of Danish Quentin Tarantinon, but he refuses to bring a little more mood to the dominant current or introduce a little less brutality to the art and testing cinema.
Most art cinema enthusiasts must experience horror in the face of the brain that spreads all around and in the intestines.
The lovers of action films die of trouble, when the village embarks, for reasons that can be freely interpreted, with a group of Christian missionaries violent in a ship to Jerusalem; they are drowned for an eternity by calm and fog before the crew arrives in America and continues to shut up.
It is not surprising then that "Walhalla Rising" found no film distributors in Germany and that there is only one DVD.
It is mainly because of the beautiful images of poverty that deserved some attention, but also because the image of a striking film, from time to time, hides behind a pretentious and bloody appearance.
It is not about dialogues in this film, nor about a coherent action, everything is ambition, a feverish dream transformed into a film.
The viewer cannot escape it.
Refn only gives him a moment of relaxation and slowly cuts his throat with glacial images and a lugure soundtrack, but above all with an unquenchable hatred that slips from the heart of the characters.
Only a young blond boy, who stands faithfully beside the village, preserves a certain innocence, all the others are excited by anger.
More than anything else, the bourgeois hero whose furniture is never known, but who returns from hell at any time to fight enemies and temporarily allies by becoming a warrior, is perhaps sending the devil himself.
It represents rot, but perhaps also, nothing but those who are, in any case, rotten.
"Walhalla Rising" is an enigmatic film that can be detected or admired, which has the purpose of frustration, enthusiasm and wonder.
A traumatic experience.
Mysterious terrassing work
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new indications regarding a nuclear programme developed by Syria.
But that country refuses to take a stand on this issue, even less subject to the Agency's controls.
On the night of September 5-6, 2007 at midnight, at least four F-15 I fighter aircraft in Israel attacked a mysterious Cuban-shaped building in Syrian territory.
It is located on the banks of the euphrate; the largest city in the vicinity is 30 kilometres: it is Dair as-Sur.
Its name is found in IAEA documents, as it is a question of the reactor that Syria has built with the help of North Korea in stone parallelpipeped, hidden in a valley marked by the lack of electricity.
According to a briefing by the United States intelligence services, the CIA, dating from the end of April 2008, the current reactor, known as the neighbouring town, el-Kibar, would be well suited to producing plutonium, which would enable the manufacture of atomic weapons.
However, this technique has been valid since the 1950s.
The CIA showed a presentation video featuring blurred satellite images.
Through the computer-assisted animation, it indicated the probable location of each component of the reactor prior to the destruction of the power plant, which represents a miniature copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
In addition, she presented the pictures showing the building nearby, or even the interior of the building.
It seems that the reactor was about to be put into service, but it was not yet equipped with fuel bars.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombing, there is hardly more information than at the time, and even, in time, the mystery is becoming more and more dense.
The former president of the United States George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that before this attack, the CIA was certain that Syria had built a reactor at el-Kibar, but had little indexes showing that country developed "an active nuclear weapon program".
Some intelligence officers in Europe prefer to be more cautious about this and talk only about a "suppressed reactor", even if they consider the CIA's presentation as "pleasible".
They lack tangible evidence, as well as IAEA.
Questioned about how it ensures that it deals with a nuclear reactor, a high-ranking diplomat of the United Nations gave only a laconic response in the summer stating that the IAEA had sufficient "documents to ask questions".
The Syrians have certainly removed with precipitation the debris of the "unused military building" and proceeded to a methodical settlement of the land.
However, in June 2008, an IAEA expert team led by former Chief Inspector Oli Heinonen discovered in el-Kibar traces of uranium produced by men.
In addition, the IAEA has received images of satellites from commercial suppliers from a Member State showing the moment that the attack was directly followed, which appears to be more eloquent than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the anonymous sponsor, perhaps Israel, acquired them exclusively.
It is therefore impossible for the IAEA to establish their authenticity objectively.
Syria has always assured that it has never realized a secret atomic program and that it has not built a reactor.
Damascus submits that the uranium found on the site comes from the weapons used by Israel.
But the IAEA challenged this argument after the particle analysis by making it impossible.
Since then, Damas has denied any discussion on this matter, as well as on satellite images.
In addition, Syria does not allow controllers to conduct a second inspection on the El-Kibar site and refuse access to the debris of the building destroyed by the bomb.
Yet, even Israel remains silent.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then Prime Minister-in-Office at the time of the attack, recently stated: "We will never comment on this."
This is how the investigation into this case has been pending since June 2008 without a result and that it "becomes increasingly a serious credibility problem of the Agency", as recognized by a high-ranking Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna, it is finally a serious violation of the Nuclear Weapons Ban Treaty.
The IAEA considers that progress requires clarification of the existence of the other three facilities that must have a "functional relationship" with the alleged reactor.
To date, the inspectors have not indicated which facilities are here, what their function is or what they are suspected of.
According to information published by the newspaper "Süddeutsche Zeitung", they are known in the IAEA, respectively, under the names of Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, also known as neighbouring cities.
The Institute for Science and International Security (International Institute of Science and International Security) in Washington identified these localities and discovered on satellite images a complex near Masyaf that would most likely be one of the suspicious objects.
It is possible that it is located in or directly next to a military base; that is exactly why Syria refuses access to IAEA inspectors from the three sites.
In Vienna, it is claimed that the Syrians fear that the inspection group is actually spies who would be sent on behalf of the United States by IAEA to spy on military facilities.
In fact, it is information provided by U.S. secret agents that draws the attention of nuclear inspectors.
The IAEA has information, including satellite photos, indicating that vehicles have made shuttles between the three sites and the stone parallelpipede in order to transport substances.
A senior Western diplomat told Vienna that at least one facility could "serve fuel production".
There would be no "indications on sensitive activities", such as uranium enrichment and reprocessing; processes that are essential for the production of atomic weapons.
This type of reactor certainly works with non-enriched uranium.
Nevertheless, there are plausible assumptions regarding the following fundamental issues: from where uranium should have come and where plutonium needed for the manufacture of the bomb would have been separated later.
It is not known whether gravels, which could hide high-value traces, were stored in the three sites.
When hundreds of ground-loaded trucks have disappeared, no one will have any information on the place of storage of the gravel.
For the IAEA, it is unlikely that Syria would have examined the al-Tibni salt mine in 1998, located only a few kilometres from El-Kibar, on the other side of the Euphrates, to see if it could be suitable for the storage of radioactive waste.
In recent analysis of satellite photos taken on behalf of the famous Jane's Intelligence Review magazine, the former IAEA inspector, Robert Kelley, established a link between these and the reactor in question.
Satellite photos show, however, that Syria has undertaken terrassing work in the three suspicious and displaced sites of huge containers when the IAEA began demanding access to these sites.
It may be a coincidence, but it has not helped to separate suspicions.
In saying in diplomatic circles that IAEA has spent several months developing a plan for inspections to be carried out, this plan should enable Syria to preserve possible military secrets. Only time spent shows the great interest of inspectors in this case.
In the meantime, Damascus also ignored this proposal.
A year ago, if Western diplomats in Vienna had not reported the destruction of the reactor, the emergency would not be reported in this case, for example, Glyn Davies, the ambassador of the United States who has been referring for a few months to what is known as special inspections, one of the most powerful means available to the atomic agency to implement its controls.
The IAEA Director, Mr. Yukiya Amano, who has had to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option to which I am open in the future", but he hesitates again.
This means a huge risk: on the one hand, it requires a majority in the IAEA Board of Governors and a large number of the 35 countries represented there have no desire to see a escalation.
on the other hand, like this diplomat who gives thought to: "That would be useful, if in the end they find nothing"
Love in Time of War
It's been bad since Angelina Jolie made her debut in the summer as a director.
She wrote the script herself: it's a story of love between a woman from Bosnia and a man of Serbian origin.
We don't know anything more about this story, but it's enough to cause the discomfort.
A persistent rumor indicates that the woman, a Muslim, fell in love with her Serbian ass during the war in Yugoslavia.
The Federations of Bosnian women immediately protested. In response, some shooting sequences planned in Sarajevo were moved in the last minute to Hungary.
Meanwhile, the film was filmed in Hungary, but in the post-production phase, protests continue in Bosnia.
According to information published in a Bosnian newspaper, Bakira Haseic of the organization of war-stricken women has sent a correspondence to Angelina Jolie through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and has demanded to meet the actress. Jolie herself is the ambassador of goodwill of UNHCR.
She is not a diplomat, and a few weeks ago, she proposed to these women to hold a meeting with them in Hungary, but they declined this offer.
"The meeting must be held in Bosnia," Hassecic says.
There were no love stories in the concentration camps, and Jolie's scenario says quite a bit about his attitude toward the victims.
The Guardian reports that the Haseic organization has subsequently recommended that the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights withdraw the capacity of good will ambassador to Angelina Jolie.
But, in fact, what kind of scenario did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which received copies of its scenario, granted after a few hesitations a shooting authorization in Sarajevo, but we do not know why it did not come later despite that authorization.
The young author herself assures that she does not pursue political objectives with her film, that she has made great efforts to learn about the Yugoslav conflict, and that she wishes to highlight the terrible consequences of war and to give the opportunity to all parties taking the opportunity to express herself.
However, it remains vague about the content.
This is how a second synopsis of the film circulates on the Net. It is quite different: The lovers knew each other well before the beginning of the war. They meet again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to the Serbian concentration camp where the man works as a guardian.
This is still a big difference with the version "a rape victim loves his borreau".
That Jolie's film started long before the war, of course.
The pressure on it, expressed by Jolie, is "unfair and based on incorrect information".
From now on, only Hollywood fanatics can bring him peace: By illegally putting this scenario in the Net, like many others before.
Let's get out of here!
Tonight, everything goes well again with the Irish.
No trace of consternation.
This is why the local team overrules visitors from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans cry for joy on the bottom of a loud music, they crumble their feet.
Cork's Baileyu-Pub in South Ireland vibres because players launch and manage to drop table tennis balls at a distance of three meters in beer pins of the opposing team.
This bizarre show is called "song beer". The winner is 500 Euros plus a ticket to go to Las Vegas in January to the World Pong beer championship.
Cian Tanner is a calm individual; this subtle drinking game and the computerist reserved, these two behaviors really don't go well together.
And yet, even so, the 26-year-old man seeks to have fun, to turn away from the terrifying question, which will lead to the future.
The pleasure of playing Las Vegas is not included in his projects. In January, he will conduct hiring interviews in New Zealand.
"But I feel strange," he says.
"The home country is so far away and I don't have a job."
Finally: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland, "in less than two, she has obtained her desired job as an evental project manager, perhaps a good sign," said the young man smiling.
Due to the dark prospects in the country, two of Tanner's three sisters tried their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, lives in Sydney, his brother Colin now serves as a computer consultant in London.
Young people leave: The situation of most families living on the island is similar to that of tanners.
Experts from the Institute of Economic and Social Research indicate that 100,000 Irish people will soon leave their country.
They even predict a number of 200,000 emigrants by 2015.
This represents a huge loss for a small country of 4.5 million people.
If these forecasts come true, it will be a flow of emigration comparable to that which Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic boom in which the Irish have enjoyed great ease, sorrow now takes place.
The economic crisis, however, mainly affects well-trained young Irish people who have only experienced moments of happiness so far.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in years of economic boom.
Everyone had a job, there was money in excess.
In the meantime, however, three out of ten people under the age of thirty are unemployed.
The Irish Times newspaper very much publishes letters from readers written by young emigrants, who complain: "In Ireland, everything goes astray."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but the one who has the opportunity, goes away and our country thus a whole generation."
"The last one to leave turns off the light."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Student Union, sees a darker future because the government only throws dust into the eyes and offers young people no prospects for the future.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they have no strategy to create new jobs," says the 20-year-old student.
She sees how her comrades crumble from one practical internship not paid to another.
She states that it is her biggest concern to emigrate within four years.
"It's a sad and depressing thought."
However, men like Stephen McLarnon try to approach this theme positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo" exhibition which offers full support on the theme "Working Abroad".
"But work abroad is an extraordinary opportunity for new people in the profession to take the first steps at the level of professional hierarchy," says the manager.
Its website shows photos of surfers in Australia and surfers from snow to canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not an obstacle, but it also guarantees freedom and pleasure.
For six months, Sean O'Donovan has known what it means to be based elsewhere.
Since there was nothing to be done in Ireland for this 29-year-old engineer, he is now working with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction sector in Germany.
A fashion house comes out of the ground in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he will continue to work on other Hannovre or Berlin projects.
In the meantime, O'Donovan only rarely visits his home country, as he participates in an additional job, in order to be able to complete the reimbursement of the credit contracted to build his home in his home country.
"The situation is already a bit crazy," he says by crossing the threshold of his house for the first time after a long time.
"I earn money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I live practically no longer."
It bursts with a laugh embarrassed by crossing the cold rooms.
The small house is located in a residential area with well-maintained front gardens, expensive cars of large brands are parked on the access routes.
Four years ago, O'Donovan bought the house in common with his sister for an amount of 380,000 Euros, financed 100 percent by credit.
"There were moments of madness, no doubt, the money was easy," he said.
Is he afraid to see everything collapse because of the credit?
O'Donovan ponders a moment, resorts hot tea and says: "I have no children to maintain and I am young; even everything goes through, I can go back to zero."
The building engineer does not like the complaints he has often heard in recent times.
"No one should suffer from hunger, our situation is not as dramatic as what we have experienced in the island before," he says.
"Working for a moment abroad, that's not what can happen worse, maybe that's what makes us feel first Irish.
He laughs and then talks about his father who went to England during the last major economic crisis.
"He was back after seven years and, in Ireland, life just went on."
This idea pleases Cian Tanner.
Leave the future and discover how life goes on elsewhere.
In his palm tree, He already has a few years of work in London. That's why life must not be as easy in New Zealand for him and his girlfriend.
But there is one thing that concerns him well in recent days: the celebration to be held on the occasion of his 27th anniversary in Dublin.
He's afraid she can't turn into a good-bye night.
"Only, not a lot of emotions," he says by drinking a long gorge of beer.
"A good-bye, it still seems worrying."
"Let's call it a good-bye evening, relaxed, gathering some friends, with a few drinks and some games."
Democratic routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as is support for private enterprise.
The crime has become a greater concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States in much of the region.
These are some of the findings of the last Latinobarometer survey in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
As the survey has been carried out on a regular basis since 1995, it follows changes in attitudes in the region.
Two related elements emerge from the results of this year's survey, conducted in September and early October.
The first is the pretty sunny mood of Latin America.
The second is the increasing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Democracy support has increased significantly in several countries along the Pacific coast of South America (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% per year since 2002, democracy support has increased from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also increased in Mexico, where the economy recovered after a sharp drop in production last year.
But only about half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populated countries in the region, are convinced democrats, reducing the regional average (see table 2).
Some 44% of the region's respondents expressed satisfaction with how democracy in their country worked in practice; this is the same figure as last year but with a sharp increase of 25% in 2001 (Graph 3)
Some 34% said they had confidence in their country's Parliament and 45% in their government, the same as last year in both cases; but in a sharp increase compared to 2003 (respectively 17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, economic problems in Latin America had shaken support for democracy.
While this was well maintained during the global financial crisis, it is certainly due to the fact that many countries in America experienced a brief recession and received a significant recovery.
In addition, a social security network has helped to protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty only slightly increased in 2009 and decreased again to 32 per cent this year.)
But the mood varies considerably from country to country (see Graph 4).
The good economic performance of Brazil and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, translates into a widely shared sense of progress
What is rarer in Mexico and Central America is where the recession has been more severe and violent crimes have worsened.
It is only for the second time since the survey began that more respondents across Latin America as a whole have cited crime rather than unemployment as the most important problem for their countries (see table 5).
About 31 per cent say that they or one of their loved ones have been victims of criminal acts in the past year; however, this figure has fallen from 38 per cent last year and has been the lowest since 1995.
A more robust economic performance is reflected in increased support for private enterprise and market economy: approximately 71% of respondents in the region say that private enterprise is essential for development, compared to 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
Some 58% believe that the market economy is the only system that will make their country developed, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of Venezuela's respondents are of this opinion (and 80% support the private company); although their left-wing president Hugo Chavez, is expropriates many private companies.
Brazil is the largest driver in the region, mentioned by 19% of respondents (compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged from last year) and Venezuela (9%, down by 11% since last year)
But the United States is considered the country most influential by respondents in Mexico and most of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys this distinction in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A solid vote
No one expected perfect general elections in Haiti on 28 November.
But it was worse than the outsiders who wanted to help the country that was devastated and plunged into fear.
Voting boxes and a new polling station, scattered ballots in the gorges, ravaged polling stations and intimidations were presented
The polling stations were working late in the evening.
Many Haitians, including many who have been displaced following the January earthquake, were wrong in the vicinity to find a place to vote.
Some of them eventually quit.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several alleged supporters, denounced the fraud and demanded the annulment of the election.
Protests, sometimes violent, have exploded across the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the senior official in Haiti of the United Nations, sees the event as "a pretty good election in many respects".
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community cautioned that they did not "believe that these irregularities, as serious as they are, had necessarily invalidated the process".
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, the opponents of which are due to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president, and his candidate Jude Célestin, must announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The second round is expected for January.
Any hope in the election is not lost.
The two opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rapist, and Mirlande Manigat, an old lady, withdrew from their initial call for the vote to be declared null.
But there may be problems if Mr.Célestin, who has little or no perceptible support for the electorate, is declared by the electoral authority as having reached the second tower reached the second tower.
With a cholera epidemic that rages, and more than 1 million earthquake survivors still living in tents, it was feared that participation would be.
Many Haitians wanted to vote but were prevented from doing so because of the disorganization.
Almost 250,000 identity cards, required to vote, were not yet distributed shortly before the election.
The issue is important.
Donors see the election of a popular and legitimate government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And so, it is clear, the Haitians do it themselves.
The tip of the feet towards the centre
The weeks after becoming a widow, Cristina Fernández, President of Argentina, received a wave of sympathy from the public, which improved its approval rate by 20 points to more than 50%; this was her highest level since her election in 2007.
However, transforming this into a successful campaign for a second term in an election next year could depend on the choice of Mrs. Fernández, visibly in mourning, according to which she would abandon the intransigence of her late husband, predecessor and former political partner, Nestor Kirchner.
And in that respect, the signs are still confused.
Mr Kirchner, who continued to manage economic policy, even after his wife succeeded him as president, was accustomed to developing budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend additional income at will.
Ms. Fernández's government lost its majority in Congress last year, on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation has subsided after Mr. Kirchner's death from a heart attack on October 27.
Some of the dissident members of the Peronist movement in power joined Ms. Fernández.
But after chaotic sessions (where one parliamentarian hit one of his peers on the face and where others accused the government of corruption), Congress does not have to approve the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue," said the president.
At present, the 2010 budget will be implemented next year, leaving the President even more room for manoeuvre to spend at will.
The economy is overheating: it is likely to grow by almost 9% this year.
The official rate of inflation now stands at 11.1% but many private estimates and union wage claims see this figure close to 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina feared economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction priority rather than inflation control.
He refused to deal with the IMF, harassed the private sector and purged INDEC, the statistical office, which made forgery of official inflation statistics.
Can Fernández now moderate these policies?
She called for talks between private companies and trade union leaders.
And his officials say they want to limit wage increases next year to 18%.
The economy was stimulated by high global prices of Argentina's agricultural exports.
But inflation eroded the boost to growth following a strong devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps that is why Mrs Fernández shows signs of wanting to restore Argentina's financial relations to the rest of the world.
This year, the government concluded an agreement with the obligors who had refused an earlier forced restructuring of the debt for which Argentina had not settled its deadlines in 2001.
Now Ms Fernández seems to be edging towards an agreement with creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it goes some $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners have always insisted that this could not involve IMF monitoring, as is customary.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economic Affairs, announced that the Fund would provide "technical assistance" to design a new national index of consumer prices, which looks like a prelude to the consolidation of INDEC.
It is not clear whether Mrs Fernández wants to remain in politics beyond the end of her mandate, now that her husband is no longer on her side.
If it does, it needs to gain support from the middle class, among which Kirchnerism is very popular.
When the Argentinians return from their summer holidays in Mars, the wave of sympathy for it will have repulsed.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether to reject, without any noise, many policies of her husband.
A Half-Hourra for China
Taiwanese voters have moved towards a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think of her older brother on the other side of the Strait?
More than 7.5 million voters reported on 27 November, representing 70% of eligible people, to elect mayors and city councillors in five urban districts, as part of what is considered a general evaluation of the President, Ma Ying-joou.
Mr. Ma himself became a substitute for feelings over the continent, having created innovative business links, including a partial free trade pact, in the greatest reorganization of relations with China itself since 1949.
Mr. My test is successful, but it's fair.
Although his party Kuomintang (KMT) won three of the five mayors, he failed to win the majority of votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which has considered Taiwan's complete independence, has won almost 50% of all votes for the 45% KMT.
If it had been a presidential ballot, Mr. Ma would have been in trouble.
Since his election two years ago, his party's voting share has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP has attracted voters, even with the KMT in municipal councils.
The event revealed most of the main subjects of the Taiwanese elections, including campaign trucks and mass-gathering flags with girls who danced in minimal care.
An attempted mysterious murder was also carried out.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, Honorary President of the KMT, made an election tour for a KMT candidate on the eve of the election.
A man of the crowd shot young Mr. Link, purely through the face, wounding him and killing a passerby.
Strangely, it was not determined whether the shooter wanted to hurt Mr. Link or settle a dispute with the candidate.
In any event, says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PDP, the murder had consequences on the election by leading the suspicion on the DPP and turning voters to the KMT.
Maybe the biggest winner of the election was China.
It was striking that the issue of the continental part itself was absent.
Instead, candidates played with plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates China's military threat.
Thus, the KMT tends to avoid disrupting its ties with the Beijing government.
But this time, the DPP also abstained from attracting anti-Chinese sentiment.
It is the response to a new awareness that Chinese companies are indispensable to Taiwan's economic survival.
Mr Ma, for his part, claimed confirmation as to whether his China policy was acceptable to the Taiwanese majority.
It can be expected that the Beijing government will continue to provide commercial facilities, in accordance with its strategy to lure Taiwan back to the dock.
China has not lost time sending a negotiator to Taipei to organize a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Of course, she would also like to see political integration, but let's start with the beginning.
Better wait for this after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has in any case reinvented itself.
Two years ago, he was wrong: his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, had been sent to prison following charges of corruption.
President from 2000 to 2008, he was a provost for explicit independence.
But a new generation of moderates came under the leadership of Ms. Tsai and the PDP are doing everything to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai was praised as a DPP candidate for the presidency, such as Su Tseng-chang, who served under Mr. Chen.
Their party is doing its best to show that he too can engage with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai announced plans for a panel of experts to act as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that their interviews could take place without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai told the Taiwanese public that her party presented a "trustworthy alternative" with regard to Mr. Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems overwhelmed by this change.
In a statement published from his cell, he stated that PDP candidates would have achieved better results if they had insisted on Taiwan being a separate country.
He even ordered Mr Su, a pragmatic, not to fight the presidency.
Even without Mr Chen's intervention, the DPP will have a hard time choosing between potential candidates.
The KMT must make an introspection of itself.
Mr. Ma's evaluations were weak; despite a vertiginous economic growth, the KMT candidates did not want to campaign with him.
Its unpopularity seems to be largely due to unemployment and the widening of the gap between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesperson said that his office and his local antennas would be remodeled.
The PDP's good results suggest that Taiwan's support for reconciliation is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, an eminent editorialist, "the point of no return has already passed."
Grammy Awards nominations: the jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a selected surprise in the category "Best New Artist"
Make at the request of a president, and people are required to know about it.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer gathered by President Obama to perform at his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, marked one of the Grammy Awards' surprises this year with a big nomination in the category of the "best new artist".
Considering that Spalding is a well-known figure on the jazz stage since his 2008 album "Esperanza", the appointment remains somewhat mysterious but it is compatible with the rules of the Grammy Awards that an artist must not exit more than three albums before the recording; which "establishes the public identity of this artist."
His 2010 ambitious album "Chamber Music Society", certainly marked a step forward and, given his slightly engaging vocal style, his hand with pop and funk skill and his Latin influences, it is possible to draw at least one pointed line at Spalding in relation to Norah Jones' glowing success in 2003, the closest equivalent for Grammy Awards voters, taking into account jazz production in this category in recent years.
Additionally, the Grammy Awards voters rightly honored Vijay Iyer Trio's "Historicity" in the "instrumental album" category, a turn on a refreshing frisson of a recording that was one of the top favorites last year.
Among these Iyers, "Moody 4B" by veteran saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" by clavierist John Beasley will be in competition.
Trombone Shorty, a popular guest in HBO's "Treme" in New Orleans, has been honored in the contemporary jazz category; also strongly inclined towards a certain fusion with the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Secret Society of the Wild Darcy James Argue, familiar with the Steampunk, has won some well-deserved awards in the big group category; in competition with the rich chamber-jazz of Billy Childs Ensemble and the eternal adventurer Dave Holland whose album "Pathways" of his octet's live was a good example of the democratic hand of this bassist as a group leader.
Grammy Awards Appointment: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey lead in classic categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd Grammy Awards each year include a mix of landscapes of musicians and composers from all over the world.
Top of the nominations, Michael Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra, with five "yes"; and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an electric orchestral work, with three "yes".
Among the nominees with ties to Southern California, there is Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his Symphony #4, "Los Angeles", a work commanded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra and opened the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The Madolin Concerto of the composer based in Los Angeles, Avner Dorman, is also in law for a reward.
The classic appointments are divided into 13 categories covering orchestra, opera, choral and solo recordings.
A category for the classic producer of the year highlights five candidates: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
The names for the classic album are the Symphonies n°3 and 4 by Bruckner of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" by Daugherty of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; "Dreamhouse" by Steven Mackey of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the art of Castrati" featuring various artists; and the "Requiem" by Verdi of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the opera category, the nominees are "Lulu" by Berg of the Orchestra du Royal Opera House, "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Adolf Hasse du Ars Lyrica Houston; "L'Amour de Loin" by Kaija Saariaho du Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; "The Enchanted Wanderer" by Rodion Shchedrin du l'Orchestre and Choeur du Théâtre Mariinsky; and "Ivanhoé" by Arthur Sullivan of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
The composers who are in place for the Grammy Awards for Contemporary Composition count Pärt for Symphony No.4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Wanderer Enchanted".
Pärt's Symphony #4 was first held at Disney Hall in January 2009 in a performance recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, led by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The work of about 30 minutes is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovski, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" was named for its solo instrumental performance with an orchestra.
The composer of Los Angeles said he soon wrote the 15-minute work for the performer at Avi Avital, who played the concerto with the Metropolis Ensemble, sitting in New York.
"I wrote it using sounds from the Middle East and a large number of ranges and rhythms in North Africa," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
The 85-year-old conductor Pierre Boulez received an appointment in the category of band benefits, for having led the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Among the instrumental soloists who received an appointment, are pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organizer Paul Jacobs, violinist Julia Fischer and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year, there are only solistic vocalists; these are: Anne Sofia Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucie Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category of classic mixtures, soprano Jessye Norman received an appointment for his recording "Racines: my life, my song"
The Temecula Mosque project wins the approval of the planning committee.
A draft mosque in Temecula received unanimous support from the local planning committee after more than five hours of public testimony, often passionate.
Critics took up the project by claiming that it was promoting both terrorism and traffic bottlenecks.
But the Commissioners ruled on Wednesday night that the new religious centre respected local laws and that it would be aesthetically impressive.
"Many good people have come to support him: Christians, Jews, Bahais, you mention him," said Hadi Nael, President of the Islamic Centre of Temecula Valley, taking the floor on Thursday morning.
"I am proud of him as an American citizen."
"It shows that justice takes it."
"The opposition is really minimal," he added.
"They just have very strong voices."
"We have good people in this valley."
The session began at 6 p.m. and lasted until almost midnight with most people speaking for or against the centre, at almost equally divided speaking time, according to the Press Enterprise.
The discussion continued on the newspaper's website.
"There's no more America," wrote one speaker.
"This is another monkey planet with Miss Liberty dead in the sand."
"America has fallen."
The planned Islamic centres also raised protests in other parts of the country, including the Ground Zero, the site of the attacks of 11 September 2001, in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmush denounced violence in the Temecula Valley.
Her congregation of 135 families co-existed without incident in Riverside County for years but she wanted a larger and better space than the warehouse that she rented on a shared property with a water filtration manufacturer.
The new mosque of 24,943 square feet in Mediterranean-style architecture would consist of two minarets and rise to 43 feet high.
It would occupy a 4.32 hectares site on the Nicolas road about two miles east of the Chaparral High School.
Opponents may still appeal against this project to the municipal council.
An arsenic-tolerant microbe raises the possibility of new types of life on Earth, or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacteria, which can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, expands the field to find new life forms on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Although researchers have discovered the unusual bacteria here on Earth, they say that this shows that life has possibilities beyond the major elements that have been considered essential.
"This organism has a double capacity."
"It can develop either with phosphorus or with arsenic."
"That's why she's very special, even though she's far from being a really "foreign" way of life," commented Paul Davies C. W. of the University of State of Arizona, co-author of the report in the online edition of the journal Science.
Six major elements have long been considered essential for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
But researchers have found that the bacteria, discovered in Mono Lake, California, are able to continue to develop after replacing the phosphorous with the arsenic.
"We wonder what is still possible," said Ariel Anbar D. of the State University of Arizona, co-author of the report.
The discovery is important in life-search beyond the Earth because researchers need to be able to recognize life, to know what life looks like, says Anbar.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss it, which did not disclose the details of the finding, generated widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could disclose the discovery of an extraterrestrial life.
That was not the case.
The discovery "shows that, in other global environments, organizations could be able to use other elements to act biochemistry and that the "standard" set of elements, which we consider absolutely necessary for life, could not be fixed," commented Charles Cockell, professor at the Institute of Global and Space Scientific Research, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is new because it shows the substitution of one element to another in fundamental biochemistry and biochemical structure," Cockell added.
It wasn't an unexpected discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon from NASA Astrology Institute, who led the study, chose Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar; thus, it has speculated that a microbe exposed to both substances could be able to replace each other.
"Arsenic is toxic primarily because its chemical behavior is really similar to that of phosphorus."
"As a result, organizations have difficulty distinguishing these elements separately."
"But arsenic is different enough so it doesn't work exactly like phosphorus; it penetrates inside and somehow erases the work of our biochemical machine," Anbar explained.
Researchers collected the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed it to increasing arsenic concentrations to which it was able to adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus but the fact that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that a life-form using arsenic can occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or the moon where arsenic is more frequent.
Jamie S. Foster, Assistant Professor of Microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea, that arsenic could be replaced by phosphorus, was not new; but nothing has ever shown that it could work.
The arsenic was more frequent at the beginning of the Earth's existence, she said; thus, the researchers expressed the hypothesis that the first forms of life could have used it.
This suggests that there could be other ways of shaping life, not just the way life on Earth was formed at the beginning," said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was funded by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Institute of Health.
The last two stolen exposure dogs were found in Compton
The other two dogs exhibiting on four flights from outside a motel in Bellflower were found, the Los Angeles County sheriffs announced it on Thursday.
The four exposure dogs - two akitas and two pembroke Welsh corgis - disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the Chevrolet Express truck in which they had spent the night outside a Bellflower motel, announced the authorities.
Two of the dogs were recovered Wednesday afternoon, and the other two were found at the end of the evening, said Steve Whitmore, the spokesperson for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's department.
"The good news is the dogs are going well," said Whitmore.
"They are in good shape."
"They have been returned to their rightful owners."
Whitmore refused to say exactly where the dogs had been found, in which neighborhood and what were the circumstances of their discovery.
"An investigation is under way."
"We don't mean it," Whitmore said.
"We follow orders."
Dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be attached to provide a comment on Thursday.
They were gathered on Wednesday afternoon with their two Akitas in an animal shelter in Downey County.
The sheriff's assistants found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female, were healthy and except, the authorities announced.
But Bunny and Peter, the corgis Rickard and Peek had planned to show at regional competitions this week, for the owners of the Japanese dogs, were brought away until their discovery Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend as part of Long Beach's "AKC/Eukanuba" National Championship, where they planned to present Trace.
The other dogs were expected to participate in the competitions of other trials scheduled in the days preceding the exhibition "AKC/Eukanuba", said Peek on the Times Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops of the canine exhibition tour of almost a month of the couple.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their van outside, right next to the window of their room.
They took three other dogs - a boxer kitten, a Parson Russell terrier and a Breton Spaniard - who stayed with them in the motel room.
But they left Akitas and the corgis, in the thicker fur, in the truck where it would be cooler.
They've kind of opened the windows so the dogs can have fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the truck's flight at 6 o'clock on Tuesday.
Peek said they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the corgis, with a microchip implanted to identify them.
It is not clear whether a reward was awarded on Thursday.
The lion is ready to roar again, the restructuring of MGM expects only the final green light of the court
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally obtained the green light to start again to zero.
A federal court of New York bankruptcy officially praised the "pre-packaged" plan by creditors that approximately $5 billion of the debt would be erased; opening the way for the entertainment company, 86 years of age, to focus its efforts on the production and distribution of films and television programs.
With the Thursday decision, according to which the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, no more legal obstacles remain before MGM to fly back under the supervision of the founders of Entertainment Spyglass, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become directors-general of what will be an alleged study.
Staff will be brought back to about 320 out of 400 at departure.
MGM will not really emerge from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase has concluded a $500 million credit facility, planned to finance new operations and productions of GMM.
It is currently licensed by the investment bank, which itself faces $75 million, and is expected to be funded by mid-December.
The restructuring process of the studio began in May 2009 when the investment bank Moelis & Co. was launched to advise management on how to place its finances as it did not have the means to pay interest of $300 million per year.
In August, Director General Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and a well-known recovery expert for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to solve MGM's financial difficulties and satisfy the more than 140 studio creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed, at the end of 2009, to put the company on sale.
However, auction sales attracted few bidders, among whom none of them were willing to pay the amount of 2 billion more that creditors were looking for.
In the spring of this year, everything needed to be done once the GM team had started working on a restructuring plan, which, after months of internal disagreement and debate, was finally approved by the creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially leaves bankruptcy in the following weeks, Moelis and Cooper companies receive multi-million dollar premiums for their work.
Moelis & Co., who has already obtained $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies, which collected 37,000 dollars a month for their corporate management services, will receive a "success first" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to relaunch the production of MGM, which only released one film this year, and set up an annual list of seven or eight films that would be released from 2012.
They also intend to co-finance two films based on "the Hobbit", with Warner Bros
The studio must conclude a separate loan between $265,000,000 and $275 million to finance its share in these two films, which must be made by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns about 18% of MGM's debt, tried to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the main shareholder.
However, the recent discussions between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Tech toys to keep your gift budget balanced
Although the most wonderful game candidate this year is the IPAD, followed, perhaps, by Microsoft's video game system, Kinect, both can make an important break in your gift budget.
Consider that, for the price of an iPad, you can buy five BMX bikes at $99 and a Kinect game costs the same price as 10 classic pearl jump strings, or about 48 Play-Doh boxes.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
Recently, I visited three national toy sellers - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and Wholesale Club of BJ - to see the electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It is clear that Moore's Law has evolved, this year's technological toy is likely to have more strength; while costing the same price if not a little less, compared to last year.
In addition, while there are generally fewer new toys associated with websites, two of the best known web sites, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And button piles toys are increasing, as well as rechargeable battery toys.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise indicated.)
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for 3 years and over) are wig toys of the size of a pig from India who sing a note when pressing them on the belly.
A pressure is equal to a note, and a second makes it possible to compose a song.
If you buy several, they will sing in harmony.
Attention: Once you start to support, you can no longer stop.
To combine the song with the dance, Dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, $60 for 2 years and over) is the best choice.
Inspired by last year's Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays role-playing games like Simon Says and can do lunar dance thanks to its innovative articulated feet with wheel lock.
Children who have tested the toy use Mickey as a dance instructor while their parents complain about a lack of control of the volume.
If you are a child of the 1980s, you will remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
It is back (Hasbro / Playskool, $40 for 3 years and over), with a backpack filled with questionnaire playing cards designed to transform a ride into a session with a self-correction and a valve classer.
If you are suspicious when your child holds your smartphone, here are three autonomous alternatives.
The VTech Mobigo ($60, for 3 to 8 years) is the cheapest and easiest to use, with a qwerty keyboard, although the games do not educate as effectively as the Leapster Explorer ($70, for 3 to 12 years), it is the first major revision of the Leapster range, with a more recent and brighter screen.
No version is compatible with the old cartridges.
Fisher-Price's iXL ($90, for 3 to 7 years) uses an iTunes-type system to offer electronic games and books and is equipped with an SD card entry that allows you to display family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8 years and older) is a set of five blocks barely bigger than a lightbox, each possessing its own LED screen.
The goal is to form words by placing the blocks online before time runs, it is ideal for an impromptu spelling contest.
More and more, toys have a kind of online connection.
Based only on their presence in toy stores, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child an online pet from Club Penguin, for example, you can get a Penguin Disney Club 2"Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, for 6 to 12 years) that includes a room marked with a hidden code.
When you buy the code online, your child receives enough credit from the Club Penguin store for two items of choice.
It can be roller skates or a pet toy Puffle.
Lightly bigger than the hair at the end of your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and older) is the last button-slap micro-robots.
The false beast moves quickly on 12 vibrant silicone pastes in random directions.
It's fun to do a labyrinth of blocks to see if she can find her way through.
It is also strong.
Ours resisted a drop in the kitchen table and even a momentary passage in our dog's mouth.
Bring a smoother side to maintain order in China
Tang Shenbin set up a place in the city as an urban sergeant at training by carefully inspecting his nerve loads, by making low-ranking orders with military authority.
He wanted the female members of the Chegguan - responsible for public order in China, afraid and despised for their arbitrary repression and hanging them for violence - to convey a certain impression to a group of spectators.
"Hold on!"
"Be aware!"
Show them, he says, "What do pretty girls look like!"
Four girls who had barely passed the adolescence in white gloves, dressed in jackets and identical olive-coloured pants, were looking at the guard.
Four pairs of black heel shoes, aligned to the rule.
Four carefully cured hats perfectly perched to the top of hair attached by a scratched knot in blue and white.
"Personally, I think they have an average appearance," said Mr. Tang, with detachment.
"The models are beautiful."
More than one government has tried to refresh the image of China's urban inspectors.
One city demanded that all new recruits have a higher education degree.
The province of Guangdong exchanged the grey-green of the uniforms against a so-called more engaging blue.
Wuhan, in Central China, replaced them with the strong way: in 2009, a report reported that 50 officers had encircled an uncontrollable snack cart by launching black eyes, firmly for half an hour, until the co-rapporteur repacked his business and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, chose to perform a major image operation.
Since 2003, the district has completed its street police in the urban environment of 13 women, specially chosen for their appearance, their cock and their early age.
The idea is to give the digrous police a softer, more feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson might have difficulties looking at this underground urban brigade in China.
And because of that, critics will say.
Unlike the police, these officers are authorized only to enforce municipal orders by imposing fines or other administrative penalties.
But Chinese media shed light on the news of a different reality.
In January 2008, inspectors in the province of Hubei beat an observer to death after he used his cell phone to film them in the process of dispersing a protest against a waste dump.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing's inspectors, which was removed and put online, describes how to effectively defeat offenders without giving blood.
This year in Shanghai, a collporter of pastries was abandoned with a brain injury after a fight with five officers.
A video game full of violence, available by online download, shows Chinese inspectors trained at the assault of street vendors.
"Changguan marked the government," lamented last year China Daily, a national publication, after a controversy over tactics.
The newspaper called for "true complete cleaning."
The skeptics say the approach is far away.
After the district made an announcement in October to find eight new female recruits, an editorial, published in The Beijing Evening News, wondered whether women had real tasks or whether they were just tourist entertainment.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district announcement required women from 18 to 22 years of age to have a beautiful silhouette and "the five features of the face in good order."
They must be above the average size of 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1⁄2 inches.
Retirement at 26 is compulsory.
The officers stated that work was physically too difficult for women over 25 years of age.
"It's their image that's important," said a certain district officer at Rednet.com, a quasi-governmental website.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they are appropriate; this is the size, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the temperament and the "interior qualities."
The women of Chengguan are like flower pots, he said, adding: "In addition to being vases, they will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Director of the City District Management Office, does not adhere to this description.
But he noted that the height requirements were the standard standard in many Chinese employment offers for both sexes.
This is the case with the requirement regarding the order of the facial features.
What that means is beautiful is a subject of debate among the Chinese.
Of course, persons with disabilities or disaggregated persons must not apply.
"We can't let a person who drinks or a boss come to serve here," said Mr. Zheng.
"He wouldn't give a good image."
Liu Yi, which patrols on Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old and has cheeks with a finely curved mouth.
She does not consider the development of her appearance as being sexist, she says.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked for a dull air.
Xu Yang, his 21-year-old colleague at the pits, says, "Our job is to present the image of the city."
They did not object to their limited mandate, they said, because they nurture greater career ambitions than simply hunting the sellers in the streets where they were supposed to limit their activities.
Each morning, the team faces a dozen traveling merchants who travel quickly on foot or by bicycle, trying to sell as many small breads as possible or tofu bowls before they get away.
"Master Wang, you must leave."
"We've already told you many times!" said Mrs. Xu, as a salesman fled on foot, temporarily abandoning his bicycle-carrette with noodles.
Officers describe their duties rather as monotonous than hardy.
"It's about the same thing every day," said 20-year-old Huang Jing, who studies post-work marketing.
"Great routine."
One reason is that female agents do not have the power of their male counterparts to confiscate the property of the sellers.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male superiors.
This tends to protect them from sudden public exposures of animosity against bureaucracy that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, revolted after the spread of false rumors that the Chegguan officers had killed a seller.
In one night, more than a dozen police and constables were injured, 14 government vehicles were demolished or fired.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
But calm is hardly guaranteed.
Just two pasta of plagiarized houses in Baoguang Square, where female officers were patrolling that morning, more than 50 people gathered at the corner of the street.
The agents confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a store, as required by the regulations.
The owner of the bike screamed at the scandal.
A 15-minute iron arm followed before the police, on their left face, broke a elbow path to their vehicle and left at full speed with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a male team coordinator, remained behind, his white badge returned to hide his name.
Like female officers, coordinators - men 40 years of age or older - are merely playing a supporting role.
Unlike them, they are not trained to maintain a waxed image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we're physically fighting," says Mr. Lid of a neutral tone.
"Most of the time, it's the public that starts."
Prosecutors will not blame Senator Ensign
The prosecutors of the Department of Justice lifted the criminal charges brought on Senator John Ensign, which came from a case involving an assistant of a former campaign and his efforts to obtain a lobbying job for the husband of the woman, announced Wednesday the honourable senator's lawyers.
The decision put an end to the most serious legal threat faced by Mr Ensign, the republican of Nevada, who was considered a possible Republican candidate to the 2012 presidential election until the scandal around his business made the big national titles last year and damaged his career.
Mr. Ensign's office stated that he was "very happy" by the decision, a result of a one-year investigation.
The honourable senator could still be exposed to disciplinary measures taken by the Senate Ethics Committee.
Mr. Ensign's lawyers stated that the Department of Justice had "reported that Senator Ensign was no longer the subject of the investigation and that he did not intend to hold any charges against him in this case."
The Department of Justice abstained on this matter.
The announcement came as a kind of surprise for many lawyers of ethics outside the Department of Justice, who said there would be significant evidence indicating that Mr. Ensign would have conspired to violate a federal criminal ban on lobbying.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents, first reported in October 2009 in the New York Times, indicated that Mr. Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to get a lucrative lobbying job to win the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the honourable senator's case with her.
Ms. Hampton once served as a treasurer during an Ensign campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political donors to find work for Mr. Hampton and then defended their rights after they hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them; in accordance with the documents and interviews.
Since Mr. Hampton had recently been a collaborator of Mr. Ensign, he was prohibited for a year by law from lobbying with his former employer or the Senate as a whole.
Ethics experts argued that the unusual agreement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were close friends before the case, seems to conflict with the so-called prohibition of the lobbying door.
According to the evidence that has been made public, "there appears to be prima facie evidence of a plot in order to violate and substantially violate the law of the rotating door," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients from an investigation by the government.
Although the department's judge refused to explain the reasoning that led to the decision in Ensign, Mr. Brand, and other ethics lawyers said that the department seemed to interfere with political proceedings after a number of high-level reversals by its public integrity section, including last year's decision to abandon prosecution against former Senator Ted Stevens accused of misconduct.
Federal prosecutors are clearly afraid to take up arms, said Melanie Sloan, the Director General of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a defence group that received several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
"This basically says high-ranking government official can now assume the laws don't apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, Senior Counsel of Mr. Ensign, stated in an interview that he had received a phone call from a prosecutor of the Department of Justice on Monday and a follow-up the next day, saying that the department was not looking for charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign's lawyer team had cooperated with the prosecutors to try to persuade them that the honourable senator, as his office reiterated in a press release Wednesday, "has acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments he had made to the prosecutor's office.
"I am not comfortable entering into the details of my discussions with the Ministry of Justice, except to say that we believe they have made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Elections Commission decided to abandon an investigation following an independent complaint by the ethics group, claiming that the payment of $96,000 by Mr. Ensign's parents to Hampton violated the federal electoral law.
The Electoral Commission stated that it did not have sufficient evidence to prove that the money was everything except a gift.
NV Energy, an important Nevada company that has long supported the senator, is a company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find lobbying work.
An e-mail sent in December 2008 showed that after the company received Mr. Hampton as lobbyist, the Chief of Staff of Mr. Ensign, John Lopez, communicated with Mr. Hampton and told him that he "brought" the Ministry of the Interior on a matter in dispute.
Mr. Ensign also participated in a lunch with Mr. Hampton and another client from Nevada, Alligian Air, and asked the Transport Secretary to set a meeting on behalf of the airline after he had hired Mr. Hampton to lobby.
When the news of the case ran out last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned from his position as a leader at the fourth Republican rank in the Senate.
After maintaining a low profile for several months, Mr. Ensign stated two weeks ago that he intended to fight a third term in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr. Ensign was no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokesman, Jennifer Cooper, said that the senator hoped that the ethics committee would follow the Department of Justice quickly and put an end to his investigation.
Senator Ensign is pleased to continue his hard work on behalf of the Nevada people, she says.
Cheshire's call will point to Twitter
Half a dozen of them were slapping in the ranks of the hearing room away.
They sent every minute reports of horrible testimonies on Twitter.
In the end, the defence said that there were more than 140,000 messages about the rape case and the children tied to their bed in a house that was burned down.
Thursday, the widespread trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three Cheshire family members in Connecticut, should lead to an official end in which the judge would impose the death penalty, voted by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already submitted evidence to the court that drafts appeals, which may be held by the courts for years.
What is causing is that the intense reports on the trial - as well as the widespread and widespread use by Twitter journalists - have created a "circle atmosphere", a saturation so widespread and instantaneous with incendiary details that the jury has been badly influenced by public passions.
The request could lead judges to debate whether new technologies require new rules in the courtrooms.
"I have experienced this during this trial; I think there is a real danger, the introduction of new technologies in the courtrooms undermines human rights at a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullmann, lawyer of Mr. Hayes, Chief Counsel.
The judge of the trial, Jon C. Bleue of the Superior Court of State, laconically dismissed the claims in the judgment delivered last week, claiming that the media were "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury would have been animated by passion.
But this does not seem to be the last word on the question.
Appeal courses have recognized for decades that media coverage of notorious cases may raise questions about the fairness of a trial.
In a 1966 ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court annulled the condemnation of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, supporting in his decision that there was a "carnaval atmosphere in the trial" because of the media.
The crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for the television show and the movie "The Fugitive".
Some lawyers have stated that the appeal courts seized to review the conviction of Mr. Hayes a half century later may be curious given the argument that new rules might be necessary to manage the means of communication of the hearing rooms, unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a general reason to be concerned about the impact of new media" in large-scale trials," said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that it was arbitrarily applied.
Professor Donohue states that some appellate judges might be intrigued by the idea that the restriction of instant communication from hearing rooms could allow fairer trials.
The case of Twitter is only one of many others described by Mr. Hayes' lawyers, which may be discussed for years, which delays execution.
Defence lawyers also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes would have suffered injury when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them macabre photos of criminal scenes during the selection of the jury.
Some of the jurors said they were horrified by the photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and her daughters, Hayley, 17 years old, and Michaela, 11 years old.
Defence lawyers claim that they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and argue that the judge unjustly expelled one of the jury, who was critical of the prosecutors, and abused pressure for a verdict by making the unusual decision to bring the jury to the proceedings in a weekend.
The jury wasn't kidnapped.
But their arguments about the effect of the intense media coverage of the trial could be the greatest source of interest.
They noted in a protest against the verdict, filed last month, that the case dominated the media scene in Connecticut and that it was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for the position of governor and the Senate of the United States.
They maintained that the computer media did not stop attracting the flames of the emotion of the case.
"The daily busculade of media tweets, cameras and journalists in front of the court palace," the lawyers wrote, "was nothing like what had been seen here before, in New Haven, and perhaps even nationally."
Their focus on the coverage of the Twitter system is controversial.
In the interviews, some journalists stated that the assertion that the new snapshots were more incendiary than the more slow reporting reports was a luudist view that would deplete the Court's policy governing media coverage of future trials.
Some lawyers, however, stated that the appeal courses were often attracted by the arguments that social and technological change required adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers insist on this claim.
In their file, they referred to the Supreme Court decision of 1966 which reversed Dr. Sheppard's conviction because of the media coverage of the trial, and they stated that they would invoke the need for new rules for the new media.
"This case," they wrote, "representing that of Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st Century."
Can civilization bring the cleavages closer?
After a campaign marked by invetivity and negativity, a minimum of civilization broke out in Washington this week.
Is this an early sign of true bipartite cooperation towards the front or an illusory moment before the rapid return to the partisan struggle in the capital?
The Tuesday meeting between President Obama and the leaders of Congress has produced no breakthroughs on the big issues that need to be addressed during the session of the "Boyful Duck".
But obviously there was at least a polite discussion about the differences between the two parties and the recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another episode where each camp wanted to mark points.
The public meeting of the Committee on the President's deficit on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political divergences that remain among the members.
It seems clear that the close interaction of several months has created mutual respect transcending the ideological divide; however, it still divides the members.
It is barely enough to state that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Both sides are now in a period of testing and testing for signs of cooperation and compromise, while attempting to assess the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters for a renewed partisan war.
For this reason, Tuesday's meeting and subsequent comments from participants revealed a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and Republicans are too great and too profound to suggest a rapid change in the climate that has existed over the last two years.
Whether it is taxation, expenditure, health care or rights, both parties remain at thousands of distances.
However, the November election had moderated at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed over the tone," said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official, now next to the Centre for Ethics and Public Policy.
"It's inevitable after the elections.
The elections provoke partisan passions and then they are astonished.
That's good."
On some issues, including those on the agenda of the "Boyful Canard" session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush's tax cuts will expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of this.
Both sides want to find a way to preserve a part or the whole, permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, a compromise is possible on the extension of unemployment benefits, would it not be because Republicans cannot afford to give themselves the impression that they are in favour of tax cuts for the rich, while refusing unemployment benefits to the unemployed.
After the Tuesday meeting at the White House, more optimism on a possible agreement on the issues raised during the session on the "Beauty Duck" with the ratification of the "New START" pact.
But William Galston, of the Brookings Institution, warns that fruitful cooperation on the most pressing problems of the "lame duck" session will not necessarily lead to better agreement between the two parties when the 112th Congress meets in January.
Instead, he says, a period of disagreement is likely or is inevitable.
"Once the things that must be done will be done, psychology in the short term will return to one of the confrontations," he said.
Wehner also expressed his widely shared skepticism that civilization would lead to genuine cooperation.
"I consider most of what is happening between today and 2012 as a pre-show or shadow-boxing compared to the 2012 main event, he says.
The reasons are closely related to the composition of the new Republican majority in the House and the voters present in the tea who contributed to its creation.
However, Republican leaders are aware of the dangers if they go too far, they know that they must try to live up to their promises of reducing public spending and repealing the new Health Care Act.
These partisan positions are already clear in the first reactions to the recommendations of the deficit commission, which include reforming the tax code and increasing certain taxes, reversing retirement age and reducing expenditure.
Co-Presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have chosen one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and have, in their own view, imposed the issue of the deficit on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the committee, consisting of 18 members, to issue their plan as an official recommendation, and they have had a hard time reaching that number.
The greatest resistance remains among the elected members of the group, which suggests that there is at least today little reason or will to compromise.
Galston foresees two phases in the fights between the White House and the Republicans of Congress.
The first will come next year in the form of partisan clashes, as Republicans challenge Obama in terms of budgets, taxes and health care, and then be followed by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What would be the cause of change?
Public opinion.
It is widely demonstrated that, despite the partisan spirit of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see both parties work together.
If confrontation leads to an impasse, as in 1995, then both parties will observe the public's reaction carefully.
The loser will have to change his mind and make compromises.
But that would be an optimistic point of view.
The partisan spirit and polarization are greater today than they were in the mid-1990s and there appears to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and the Republicans of Congress than there was then between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 as a simple prelude to a more significant election in 2012.
In view of this reality, the civilization exposed this week could be appreciated by many Americans.
But it will take much more effort on the part of both parties to find a common ground on the issues that divide them.
U.S. released documents describe Moscow as a haven of corruption
The city's control is in the hands of a "Kleptocracy" and has to pass to the Kremlin some of the wine pots and the money it collects, reported the US Embassy in Russia in a note in February.
The police and the Federal Security Service make huge rackets that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow, he said.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses but also from organized criminal groups.
Each layer of the bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the "vertical of power" - takes his part while the money walks up the ladder.
The service note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted on Wednesday by Wikileaks on its website.
The note is based on sources whose names have been evicted.
It was written while Iuri Loujkov was still mayor of Moscow; and he is largely held responsible for corruption.
He was dismissed in October by President Dmitri Medvedev, but since then there have been few cleaning traces.
Loujkov and his wife, Elena Batourina, who owns a leading construction company, have always denied charges of corruption over the years; and he has won several defamation trials on these charges.
In September, he said what follows to a Russian television channel, when he was interrogated on a documentary suggesting that he was corrupted: "It's crazy, it's to throw, it's anything."
The Russians believe, to a overwhelming majority, that their society is corrupted; according to polls.
But it is unusual to find the information contained in an embassy account; and it is unheard of to conceive that it would be to diplomats from a foreign country to do so.
The direct link between the Moscow city government and crime has led some people to name it as "dysfunctional" and to assert that the government worked more as a kleptocracy than a government," according to the Ambassador's note.
"The criminal elements have a "krysha" (the term used in the criminal world/the mafia which literally means "top" or protection) that passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior (MVD) and the prosecutor's office, as well as through the entire bureaucracy of the Moscow government.
Analysts to identify a three-tier structure in Moscow's criminal world.
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The FSB, the MVD and the militias are on the second level."
"At last, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a vacuum in certain areas where the city does not provide certain services."
The report indicates that the FSB embraces money from larger companies and that the police target small ones.
One source, he said, "explained that Moscow's business owners understood that it was preferable to obtain protection from MVD and FSB (rather than organized crime groups) because not only do they have more weapons, more means and more power than criminal groups but they are also protected by law."
"That's why the demand for protection by criminal gangs is no longer as high."
The note notes that, although the collection of money is extended, protection itself may be uneven; even those who pay are sometimes subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly see their affairs closed under one pretext or another.
Medvedev referred to the fight against corruption several times, but he admitted little progress.
The note from the embassy transmits reports of men who bring suitcases, probably filled with money, to the Kremlin.
"In its fight against corruption, Medvedev depends on bureaucrats," said Gueorgui Satarov, director of Moscow's "think tank Indem".
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"He is not part of a political class because he does not exist in Russia."
Without politics, without opposition, without separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
According to India, the costs of corruption would rise to more than $300 billion per year throughout Russia.
The country was ranked 154th in a recent survey on the overall perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (the countries are classified at least at least as corrupt).
The disclosure of the U.S. Embassy note, which was only made yesterday, late in the evening, Moscow time, will remove with certainty the discontents within the Russian government; although Loujkov may, to some extent, be blamed for Moscow's failures, this could be the opportunity for the Kremlin to show that he is solving the problem.
Interviewed by CNN by Larry King, Putin suggested that WikiLeaks' documents could be a manufacture and reacted with anger to the words that US diplomats had made known by calling him Batman and approaching Medvedev of Robin.
"The problem is based on the fact that it is our interaction, an important factor in domestic policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest with you, we didn't suspect it would be done with such arrogance, such pressure and, you know, in opposition to ethics."
Former Khmer fighters forced to face the past
In a poorly lit classroom with poor-quality concrete walls, the principal of Anlong Veng's high school spoke to the man who had built it, the last head of the Khmer Rouge, Ta Mok.
"Everybody here loves Your Mok."
"He was a good leader; and he cared about his people," said Mr. Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Known as "the butcher" for his brutality, when he was at the head of the Khmer Rouge, this commander remains popular in this isolated bastion of former Khmer Rouge northwestern Cambodia where he has had hospitals, bridges and other infrastructures built; and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live today.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge went to the government, long-standing loyalty is finally called into question at Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum of truth and reconciliation enabled victims to face publicly the people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed a high school textbook that, for the first time, taught the history of the Khmer Rouge to the children of its former soldiers.
And in July, a Cambodian court, jointly led with the United Nations, handed down its first sentence concerning a former member of the Khmer Rouge, condemning, to 35 years in prison, the former chief of the sadly famous torture centre of Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as "Duch".
In the face of this development, anxiety has increased among the veterans of the Khmer Rouge of Anlong Veng; complicating the efforts of reconciliation and their willingness to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There are resentments and fear among former Khmer Rouge but they are powerless to do anything," said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Centre, an independent agency that conducts research on the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"The situation generates divisions within families."
Under the Khmer Rouge reign in Cambodia from 1975 to 1979, approximately 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, disease or over-dwelling.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrowed the government of Pol Pot-U.S. in 1979, the rest of the regime and its army fled to the border of Cambodia with Thailand.
There, they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last of the movements took place in December 1998.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrillas of their base in the western mountains of Cambodia and in the jungle, Ta Mok prepared a follow-up to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a peace agreement sponsored by the United Nations led to the first democratic elections in the country in 1993, large groups of Khmer Red fighters began to defecate the government, culminating in the capitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had been leading, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the mountains near Dangrek.
He died in a prison in Phnom Penh in 2006 pending his trial.
Without their beneficiaries, most red Khmer veterans have sunk in black poverty, common in rural areas of Cambodia, and many remain nostalgic in the movement.
Although some Khmer-Red elite officers have kept their local leadership positions in exchange for weapons deposited, they are low-grade, low-grade, and record-qualified farmers.
"These people received very little follow-up after capitulation," said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, organizing public forums throughout Cambodia, including Anlong Veng.
"They are embroiled in the diet's utopian ideology."
"They were raised in a business environment is a foreign concept."
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling in 1998 as a poor rice farmer.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Your Mok feeds everyone."
But now life is difficult because we have to meet our own needs."
The current Khmer Court of Reds has also raised concerns here.
At the beginning of next year, the court is expected to commence the judgement of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Red Minister.
The court's mandate is to judge the senior officials and the main perpetrators of the crimes, but he did not say whether he was pursuing beyond these four cases.
There is more to calm fears in Anlong Veng.
The latest media speculations turned to Im Chaem, aged 64, former district chief in the province of Banteay Menchey under the reign of the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Cambodia Documentation Centre that she had overseen the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project where thousands of forced workers would have been killed.
Recently, during a torrid evening, Im Chaem returned from work in the field near his wooden house on the pilotis, on a dirt road outside of Anlong Veng.
As the sun cast long shadows on the dried grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss his past in the Khmer Rouge.
If the court summoned her, she said, she would refuse to go.
"Cambodia is at peace and stable," she says.
"If there are more prosecutions, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defied the Khmer Rouge in 1978, also repeatedly warned that instability would occur if the court continued several suspects; although experts and historians challenge that.
"Cambodge must dig up a hole and bury the past," he said.
But confronting the past is all Cambodia has to do to move forward, says Youk Chhang, from the documentation center.
"The reconciliation in Khmer is to reconnect the broken pieces, he says.
"We must put these pieces together so that we can understand."
The centre produced the first manual approved by the government on the Khmer Rouge, "A History of the Democratic Kampuchea, composed of 75 pages."
He distributed it to Anlong Veng in June as an supplement to the history manuals of the Ministry of Education, designed for high schools, which contained less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most Cambodia, Anlong Veng's youth know only a few details about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's links to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a high school student in Anlong Veng, said the new manual helped students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted with skepticism when he came home with the book to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the manual and the court," he says.
"They're suspicious because they don't know exactly how many people the court will pursue."
Such resistance has made the process of reconciliation complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the manual and the court are beginning to have an impact, he said.
However, the Khmer Rouge retain a powerful attraction here.
In the mountains of Dangrek, a path, invaded by weeds and embroidered with plastic bags, leads to a rectangle of black silk, covered with a rolled sheet roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pile of tires after its death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, aged 31, selling mobile phone on the roadside, said she did not know much about the man who was incinerated at this place.
"But he has a great mind; and many people go there to pray, she says.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later that day she planned to walk to Pol Pot's last resting place where she would leave a bouquet of ripe bananas in the hope of bringing luck.
Belarus agrees to renounce its military-grade uranium stock
The Belarus government announced on Wednesday that it would abandon its highly enriched uranium stock, an essential component for nuclear weapons; this decision is part of a surprising victory of President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear materials around the world
The agreement was made public in a joint communiqué published after the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met here with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Belarus, Sergei Martynov, on the margins of a security summit.
The U.S. government had tried for years to convince Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium and seemed to have released the horizon last spring.
But U.S. officials told Washington Post that some classified operations have been carried out with Belarus over the past two months to eliminate 187 pounds of military-grade uranium from a Belarus research centre.
This opened the way for an agreement on Wednesday to eliminate the remainder of the matter of about 500 pounds, according to an official who referred to the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.
The agreement appears to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit, organized on the initiative of Obama, where Belarus was excluded.
Apparently, it was beneficial to provide an invitation to the former Soviet Republic after the summit in 2012.
"I am really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the 2012 Nuclear Safety Summit Security Summit."
"It proves to me that this process works," said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a nuclear safety promotion group.
Clinton described the "very significant, important stage" agreement that was reached by Belarus.
Obama committed himself in Prague in April 2009 to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials around the world in the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries to get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries have done so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of the Obama Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexandre Lukashenko said that the nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have kept uranium highly enriched, hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially military-quality uranium and low-enriched uranium," said Mr. Loukachenko.
"It's our product ... We're not going to manufacture dirty bombs, and we're not going to sell it to anyone."
"We're going to use it for research purposes, that's all."
Belarus approached the United States a few months ago; however, it expressed interest in reaching an agreement.
The first implementation to eliminate uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated as the material had been slightly irradiated, officials indicated.
He was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to a facility in Russia to be stored and removed, officials indicated.
The second operation was completed on Monday and was carried out by plane, according to the officials.
The U.S. government spent $13 million in its efforts, largely to replace Belarus's research facilities with poorly enriched uranium; inadequate for weapons.
"A careful coordination and organization have been implemented with a view to strengthening confidence," said Andrew Bieniowski, a head of the Department of Energy specializing in the Reduction of the Global Threat, leading to the agreement signed by Clinton.
According to estimates from the James Martin Non-Proliferation Study Centre, Belarus had at least 88 pounds of military-grade uranium this year, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus seeks to eliminate its stocks by 2012, according to a joint statement.
The relationship between Belarus and the United States has been tense for years, mainly because of the harsh repression by Lukashenko of Human Rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggested a potential renewal.
"While welcoming progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus recognized that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remained essential for improving bilateral relations; and essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she said.
The government has issued no objection to CIA flights
The government has issued no objection to CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners headed Guantanamo through Spanish territory, according to a telegram from the Ambassador of the United States to Madrid.
This is demonstrated by the filtered (cables) documents by Wikileaks in the daily El País, which add that the first Vice-President of the Government of that time, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, had requested that the Spanish Executive be informed "to prove that they exercised adequate vigilance on the foreign planes crossing Spain".
In June 2006, following a report by the Council of Europe which was accused of complicity in practices contrary to human rights to a dozen countries, including Spain, held a meeting between former North American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council's report "has surprised the Government of Zapatero out of play" and stressed that Spain had nothing to hide.
"Vega stressed that Spain has no objection to intelligence thefts over Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" to avoid being "taken away," Aguirre reports in a cable.
The holder of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of that time, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, informed the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "was trying to give this case the lowest possible profile, even though, as it was in the hands of the judges, the Government had limited power."
In turn, in January 2007, Prosecutor Vicente González transmitted to the Embassy the fact that he was not going to block the judge's initiative to request the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Department of Defence on CIA flights.
"These reports contain no incriminating elements, no sensitive information," the Embassy explained after speaking with the prosecutor.
The United States has nevertheless expressed concern about "the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" more than for the declassified information of CNI o of the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination among independent investigators will complicate our efforts to manipulate the case discreetly between Governments," regrets Aguirre.
In March 2007, during a lunch between the ambassador of the United States and the Minister of the Interior, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he commented that "even though Spanish judges are deeply jealous of their independence and will do what they consider appropriate", he had instructed his collaborators "to avoid the comments of an inflamed rhetoric by trying to lower the temperature".
The Ambassador also expresses concern about the PP's action in this case.
"Despite its pro-American general orientation, our experience suggests that PP will certainly benefit from any indication that the Government of Zapatero has tolerated or willfully ignored the actions of the United States that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if those revelations have negative consequences for the Government of the United States," she said.
The parricide that was passed to the confessions complained in the network of the "casing" of being a mother
The girl was talking about the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "T error to the Galician"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" in the network.
With this nickname she used as soon as she was small, she communicated with a cousin and at least a friend; the two natives of Noia, the village of the Coruña of which she originated.
The messages date from 2008.
To hear them, it is necessary to know his sentimental life, that ABC built with the help of the testimonies of his parents.
The 30-year-old Galician girl had started a relationship in 1998 with Iván Tuñez, an industrial girl.
Their relationship lasted a year.
Soon after they separated, we knew she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was with him, but his ex never let him get the DNA test.
We discovered another new boyfriend shortly after that.
The elite was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring city councilman.
She's been living with him for a long time.
César had lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to probe the labour market, the boy stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her one week in Palma.
But according to the content of his communications, it is understood that their idyllic fractured, they separated.
In March 2008, she was in Menorque alone and wrote: "Alberto is very strange and ugly because I came to work there."
"When I had told him, it seemed a good thing to him, but of course, he now realizes what it means to be with the child all day and not to have the freedom to do what he wants."
And then, she talks about a mobile message she just got: "I want you to come in this month or you give me an address to send the child."
She complains: "If it doesn't please her, let her leave the child with my mother, and I will take her when I come home," she replied.
In May, she spoke of the return to her village: "This week I leave, but I will only stay there until 19, because on the 20th I must present myself to a job so as not to lose it".
She explains that if everything was going well, she would have taken her elder with her.
"He will stay with the right person, that is, with me, and I will never leave him with another person if that person is not my mother", a suspicious intention, taking into account their bad relationships.
In July, there is another post.
When she hits him, it is assumed that the child, who arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, and was allegedly murdered on the 10th, is dead.
"César is happy on one side, but he's not on the other."
"On one side he's with me and this place likes him a little, but on the other he goes to school almost every day."
She's talking about a trip to Majorque.
"There will be (the child) in a few hours of summer and so I save some money from the baby-sitter."
17 Greetings and Complaints.
"A very big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when will you come."
"Alberto says he sent you, I don't know what videos he's emailing, you see, whenever he wants, he finds me, shit."
On the 30th, another: "The child is well, he goes to summer hours to learn Catalan.
On Victor, his current partner, there is one: "I'm ahead of money."
On the Internet it has messages in blogs dedicated to animation and manga.
She had one of hers in the MySpace universe, now blocked, where her name was "Muki the prison liberator."
"T error to the Galician (epigrapher)."
The last man who lived with her, vigilant, expresses his regret for feeling guilty.
He doesn't want to think that everything happened so she didn't tell him the fact that she was a single mother.
Mónica entered the provincial penitentiary in Palma yesterday, from the detention centre in Menorque.
The Office's lawyer, Carlos Maceda, explained that she doesn't remember how the facts happened, "and she didn't intend to hurt the minor either."
Before she had confessed to drowning Caesar in the bathtub and deposited his body in a suitcase.
The defense and the prosecutor asked for a psychiatric test.
The members of the Popular Party would earn 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of the 18-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the significant increase in votes and MPs recorded in the last autonomous elections, the Catalan PP has already targeted the generals because, whether there is progress or not, the prospects are more than positive, because the number of votes that this training obtains in these elections normally doubles what it receives in the Catalans.
Thus, the Catalan people obtained 610,473 votes at the 2008 generals, while in the 2006 autonomouss they obtained 316,222 votes.
Last Sunday, the PPC obtained 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend is maintained, desired by a diversion of votes of the PSC and the loyalty of the electorate of the PP, the analysts of this training calculated that, if there were general elections, the PPC could move from 8 to 12 MPs in Congress, while CiU would win as many as four (now 10), and the PSC would lose no more than 9 MPs (as 25).
These calculations would show that the Catalan place is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to popular analysis, ERC would lose a Member - he now has three - while ICV would hold or win a Member.
But if the electoral agenda continues, the next appointment would take place in May 2011 for municipal elections, where the people can also be decisive at the end of the socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in their relay at the head of the Barcelona General Council, one of the administrations that manipulates the higher budget - 661 million euros for 2011-.
Both nationalists and people agree with the fact that PSC could lose the mayors of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where socialists would not obtain the majority either the possibility of using their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Taking into account the republican debacle, it would not be fantastic if this formation lost its representation in the city hall of Barcelona - it is necessary to obtain 5% of the votes.
The PP increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced that they can be the protagonists of the fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP recorded only 500 votes against PSC, whose mayor, Angel Ros, maintained very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last campaign, they met several times.
People have also made progress in other major municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
The PP is now present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in a maximum number of localities.
The Catalan cell has facilitated thousands of passports to Al Qaeda
Apart from the seven detainees in Barcelona, Thailand there were three
The seven Pakistanis and the Nigerians detained by officers of the General Information Commission of the Barcelona Police formed a jihadist cell that, led from Thailand, facilitated passports to different Al Qaeda groups, including "The Tigers for the Liberation of the Land of Tamil" (LTTE) and "Laskar e Taiba" (Let), the latter being the author of the Bombay attacks that caused the death of 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs has given great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that with "operation Kampai" has "summer weakness" the Al Qaeda falsification apparatus at international level and "consequently, its operational capacity".
Researchers estimate that the cell, within the two years during which it was active in Catalonia, was able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, or they were falsified and then distributed to groups that incorporated the Al Qaeda criminal galaxy so that its "fighters" could cross European and other Western countries with total impunity.
The dismantled cell is not the only one that the jihadist network was operating in Europe, for this reason, that other European police units, apart from Thai services, participated in the investigations, could be the following days in the territory of the European Union, similar to those recorded on Tuesday night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (Pakistans Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddica Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade) were held in Thailand another, with the capture of Pakistanians Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
They were the ones who led the established cell in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - part of which was hit in 2009 - mainly robbed tourists of passports that met the conditions marked by the so-called "World Islamic Front".
That is, the documents were to be on behalf of young men between 25 and 45 years of age, with a validity of several years and without stamped visas.
The investigators point out that so far no detail has been found that connects the detainees in Catalonia with the bombing of Bombay, even though the author of the attack, "Laskar e Taiba", was one of the receiving groups of passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be recalled that a few days before this attack was committed, Catalonia was sent through a transfer agency a few thousand dollars that were "invested" to buy mobile cards that were used after the "command" constituents who killed 106 people.
The police took over a lot of documentation.
PP asks Mas to suspend tax complicity
The PPC leader, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally expose to Artur Mas his conditions to support his investment as President of the Generalitat, identical to those exhibited during the campaign, and he was able to give priority to the recovery of the economy and the lack of philosophical-suboverainist adventures as is the economic complicity that the nationalist leader wishes to address in half of his mandate.
The President of the Catalan Peoples came to the meeting with Arthur Mas with the assurance that he had obtained 18 deputies in the elections last Sunday, a number more than enough to be loved, because the candidate of CiU requires that at least one of the formations that will exercise the opposition abstain from the vote of the investment.
A possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliances that the nationalists wish to maintain in Congress during the general elections, but, for the time being, the conversations that Mas has these days with the rest of the political leaders are Catalan key.
And with regard to the president of the PP, to support an investment "all the sovereignist and independentist speeches should be eliminated", and economic complicity - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the leader wishes to converge even to the referendum.
The two leaders have in common their bets to crush the political apparatus of a highly overstated autonomous administration and the elimination of the tax applied to estates and donations.
Details of the negotiation on the investment of Mas will be dealt with by PC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
But he has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who has promised a tough opposition - , Joan Herrera (ICRC) and today he will do so with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Citizens) and Joan Laporta (Solidarita Catalana).
Geriatric claims that the dead were not due to the "lack of measures"
The owners of the centre of Olot do not eliminate the possibility of their night nurse killing more than 11 elderly people
Geriatric officials The Caritat d'Olot (Gerone) yesterday offered a press conference to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal behaviour of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who killed at least 11 older people who were responsible in the meantime for working there.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, met with the lawyer of the centre, Joan Cañada and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be to be able to hold the charge against the responsible" for the dead but "legality and responsibility force us to assume the trialal situation of civilian officials".
And apart from the social discredit that the entity may suffer in order not to detect in time the criminal activities of the night nurse, the great threat to La Caritat now takes the form of a major compensation that legal representatives of the parents of the victims already calculate.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that from that day he did not stop killing.
The judge mentioned in the judgment that he ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former geriatric patients - that he suspected that in many cases no doctor would personally explore the deceased but, given the age and pathologies of the patients, the formalities took place by telephone.
Caritat, through her director, categorically denied this situation yesterday and pointed out that "the lack of measures may at no time have been the cause of what happened".
La Caritat's lawyer added that "in this case there is only one clue of imprudentness on the part of any other person other than the accused."
The person already baptized as the "Ange de la Mort" confessed before yesterday 11 murders and detailed that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and a month and a half later he killed a second grandmother.
In this case he caused him to die by injecting him with an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime he committed with a mix of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat mentioned the fact that it is complicated to control the access of centre staff to medicine.
Insulin injections and sedative cocktails had been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that he committed, in his desire to alleviate the suffering of the inmates, used to kill them.
But laboratory tests will clarify if Vila does not remember saying that he sought for his first victims a less cruel death or on the contrary he burned them inside by giving them injury as he has already confessed that he did with the three women he killed in the meantime 12 - 17 October.
Caritat does not believe the statements of the night nurse, nor the number of assassins confessed, they do not eliminate the possibility of the number being larger and justifying their attitude by the different versions that Vila gave in his visits to the First Instance Tribunal and the lack of logic in changing the way of killing after having successfully committed eight murders.
That is why they declare that they will remain available for justice to clarify the scope of the facts.
ECB threat
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to the threat of yesterday's Trichet that warned that "markets should not underestimate our ability to react".
The differentials of the peripherals have ended by force and the actions of the European banks have suffered more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we must not underestimate the ability of the ECB to deceive ourselves, and the euro has hardly recorded any increase, which is a worrying signal.
What happened yesterday was typical of a liquid market that in the same way as it collapsed, it recovered, but motivated by close short and very speculative positions.
The institutional investor will delay losing fear.
A month ago, the ECB quoted us today to withdraw liquidity measures and it will have to retire tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and the remaining ones.
Bundesbank required the completion of the public debt purchase plan due to its inefficiency and the elimination of all extraordinary future liquidity measures and leaving only unlimited access to the week.
After the Irish crisis, we hope that current liquidity measures will be extended "at least until March" and will continue to be sold at quarterly auctions at unlimited access at the end of the quarter to guarantee liquidity at least until June.
We hope that we will continue with the bond purchase program and even give the signal of intensifying it.
If they fail to meet the generated expectations, they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they continue blind to remove the liquidity measures, which God helps us!
As well as during their May meeting in which they claimed that they had not even considered buying bonds and collapsing markets, the story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka on Monday and Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a new collapse in the market.
Yesterday the auction of trafficking a year in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury issued only 500 million to 5.28% compared to 750 million to 4.81% of the previous auction.
Even so, the types in Portugal have dropped 30 basic points throughout the curve, clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment after the words of Trichet.
The figures for the Allied hole and Bank of Ireland were published in Ireland.
The estimated figures represent 10,000 million in the short term and 15,000 potentials and have a deadline until February to obtain private capital or will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with the stress test, the figures are assumed in the Assistance Plan and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the Government will have to obtain parliamentary approval of its new budget and it has not yet sufficient support, so Ireland remains in an uncertain home.
Angela Merkel moderated the tone of her speech to release tension before the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December in which it is necessary to find a political compromise that demonstrates that we are a union and that we all interpret the same partition.
The problem is that Germany wants to interpret Wagner and the rest of Beethoven's joy hymn.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity to present yesterday the plan of measures approved by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous communities and financial entities, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment sound to investors' hearings such as the four seasons of Vivaldi.
The double effect Trichet and ZP explains the fact that the Spanish Stock Exchange suffered 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of the European Stock Exchanges.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain was rapid and radical and we benefited from the surprise effect.
Today, there is a key auction of a three-year obligation that will benefit from the Trichet effect, so we hope that it will be solved with a strong demand and help to dispel doubts about our ability to refinance.
For Spain requesting an Assistance Plan would be self-immolation.
They would give us a liquidity line that we don't need, the Treasury has more than 40,000 million available cash, three times as compared to March, to very expensive types and they cut access to sine die markets.
Nevertheless, the strategy must continue to be that of Caesar's wife, "other than being, to be."
Courage, we can get out of it!
The president of Eulen will contest the council of Vega Sicilia requested by his sons
The storm does not end in the open conflict within the Álvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, the founder of the group, will contest, as he considers it "the nul de droit", El Enebro's judicial council on the next 16, sought by five of his seven sons in which they will try to claim their majority and take over management bodies of the firm owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José grant their legal battery for the new chapter of their dispute for control on the part of the group.
The founder of the larger holding of business services for the companies does not seem willing to give in to his dispute to be present in the executive organs of El Enebro.
He was excluded from his board of directors by five of his seven sons who became directors at the shareholders' meeting on January 18 this year, whose challenge was registered in the Register of Commerce and Corporations.
El Enebro's judicial council for the next 16, convened by the Madrid's Magistat Commercial Number 2, reopened the tuna box within the Álvarez family.
The recourse of the judge to fix the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only mechanism that guarantees the convening of the assembly.
The latest movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is qualified by David Álvarez as a "disaggregated remedy for the applicants his five sons to try, through a procedural argument, clearly misleading the Law and abusing the law, validating and correcting the assembly radically null on 18 January", according to his official spokesmen.
This argument will be the basis for the fact that, once the assembly is held, to be contested, considering that it is "nothing of the right".
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already tried without success that the magistrate convenes an assembly in June.
In El Enebro, a legacy company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, David Álvarez's sons control 100% of the capital.
However, the founder of the service group seeks the profit of 51% of the capital, according to the familiar protocols.
This case is the substantive issue that the judge must decide after the hearing on the application for a dispute for which there is not yet a date reported.
Red Bull F1 triumph with a secret weapon of Siemens
A software creates improvements on real-time cars.
As soon as Red Bull entered Formula 1 world in 2004, his history in this select universe of speed was marked by surprise and success.
At first, no one took into account the options of a new stable that had just arrived, despite the upward path of the last seasons, last November, in the final phase of the championship they all bet on the Ferrari triumph of Fernando Alonso.
Without lowering the skill as a champion's driver, German Sebastien Vette, nor the Renault engine that drives his car, in the world of Formula 1 we talk about the legend of the "secret weapon" that the Siemens multinational company put in the hands of Red Bull to transform it into a winning team.
In reality, this is a powerful process simulation software that the German company launched on the market in 2007 with very far-reaching objectives from the high automotive competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computer tool has been used to create assembly chains of factory manufacturers all over the world, power stations, high precision instruments.
The objective is to reproduce, simulate faithfully the product or process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding any defects and avoidable costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi planes or Nissan's most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the Siemens Industrial Division, explains the fact that the use of this computer tool in its Formula 1 factory allowed Red Bull to create and execute "in a few hours, almost in real time", the changes, changes and improvements detected during the races and trials.
Russwurm explains that the 1992 stables had an average of 10 technicians in their teams who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements to vehicles each season.
In the Red Bull team today, 180 highly qualified young professionals are working, with powerful computer equipment analyzing and projecting all sorts of changes on the diseases.
Siemens' leader explained that the PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all elements of Red Bull's disease except the engine, which is Renault's sole responsibility.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
Changes can move from the virtual reality of the simulator to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
As the sole limitation of this insanity of technological development there is the $40 million amount that each Formula 1 team can spend as a limit each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has installed the high-tech plant to create and produce its diseases in a locality 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings where visits, especially for journalists, are restricted.
Everything that's going on there is considered "top secret".
Staff for this duty include 580 people, including two drivers, Vettel champion and Mark Webber.
Red Bull Formula 1 hero is probably the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the brand of energy drinks has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, there are other hidden protagonists, whose activity is invaluable and null notoriety.
The factory technology manager Steve Nevey says five years ago that R+D's progress in racing cars was 50 percent of the victory and drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have changed and technology represents 85% of success, while pilots bring 15% of added value.
Nevey admits that the Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computer science, because "they are unforeseeable gladiators".
HP will install in two years 20 clean stores with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened its first exclusive store in Barcelona in collaboration with its partner Pont Reyes.
It will be the first of the network of 20 businesses between 80 and 100 square metres that the multinational plans to install in Spain for the next two years.
The company will account for this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centres such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
HP Spain's vice president Helena Herrero gave as an example the remodeled store located on the Gran Vía de Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with which it has been collaborating for 30 years.
The North American group prepared a plan to implement 200 brand sales points in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes 20 Spanish establishments.
The first openings were those of Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, the one of Barcelona being the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible stores, even though she confessed that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HM personal systems assured that the philosophy for the establishment of stores will always be the same, with the support of a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group advises and takes care of the design of the exclusive furniture of shops (with products that can be affected interactively), which in Europe will have an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of institutional staff.
Helena Herrero denied that it is a system of franchise and stressed that the exclusive network of trades claims to "improve the service offered to customers and SMEs in the purchase, assistance, after-sales and even packaging".
The Barcelona store includes a space with a worldwide pioneer pilot program that solves possible problems with HP's computer equipment as a guarantee.
An online service connects with a technical centre located in Maastricht, Holland.
"So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can often take even two days."
"This system is specially designed for MPEs and users, as large companies have already contracted technical assistance services," noted Helena Herrero yesterday.
Sabadell bets on 'fly' a million customers at its rivals in three years
More optimistic than other leaders, Banco Sabadell's managing director, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be a tough year for the banking sector, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the passive war.
Despite this, it provides for a collapse of the margins of interest, which will be tried to compensate partially with increases in commissions and credit prices.
Sabadell expects to capture within three years a million individual customers, his task to be accomplished.
Sabadell has found a way to operate for the next three years and can thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will launch a new management plan in 2011 which will have a three-year viability.
The objective, apart from surviving without the need to use FROB's public subsidies, is to gain a market share through the capture of one million new private customers - 700,000 if one deducts those who can leave the bank-, its great task to do, as so far this bank had spoiled more SMEs and companies than the particular customer.
This year he captured 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share for individuals is 3.5%, while it is more than 10% for companies.
Another basis of the 2011-2013 plan is the productivity bet, or the same thing, of austerity, with cost reduction as a goal, whose provocations will be explained by the bank when presenting the results of the exercise.
Few banks are now reluctant to set targets and make them public, as the financial crisis has disrupted all global banking plans.
Sabadell, in fact, will end this year's Optima Master Plan, established four years ago, even though the plan was initially for three years, but the market situation has determined its extension for one more year.
Customers who let the savings banks escape will be its main objective.
During a breakfast organized by APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a "difficult and transcendental year".
The executive, in fact, believes that the exit from the crisis in Spain "will be slow".
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs", which is fundamental to the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And even if he thinks that the passive war - which penalizes the margins - is reduced, the price of risk premiums that banks and cash banks pay for their emissions to get cash is already moving at the credit price to compensate for the fall in margins.
"The aspect of liquidity and financing is structural and will be a pressure factor on credit."
"We didn't tighten the tap, but the differentials are higher," said Guardiola.
Banesto has already given orders to its network to limit the long-term credit and increase the price of differentials - see CincoDías of 22 and 27 November-.
He also acknowledged that the banking sector's trend now is "increasing commissions", but "there is a competitive framework".
Sabadell's master plan is based on organic growth even if, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of corporate operations.
It is not in vain that he assures that in Spain "we will ask for larger dimensions."
"Everything will move next year," he said.
He states that the capital requirements "increase greatly" and some Spanish financial entity could enter the red numbers.
And he mentioned that the FROB can replace the market in the collection of funds in the case of new recapitalisations.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, it has reduced the importance of the fact that some banks already predict as a new liquidity crisis.
It points out that we cannot issue, but rather what happened in June, we can obtain short-term funding through rest, which alleviates the crisis.
ECSC rejects the possibility of a second wave of mergers between caisses
The ECSC Director-General, José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility of a new wave of mergers of savings banks and again stressed the speed with which the restructuring of the sector takes place.
When the concentration trial of Spanish savings banks began, several entities had assured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they would remain for the second phase.
Nevertheless, the Director General of the Spanish Confederation of Caisses d'Epargnes (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility of the production of this new wave of operations.
"I think most of the mergers have been made, it cannot be said that the incorporation of Cajasol into the group of Cívica Bank is a second phase, they are adjustments."
"Most have been fully realized; it is possible that instead of 17 we go to 13 or 14, but all major processes have already been carried out under the supervision of the Bank of Spain, which has collaborated much in this operation as well," said the leader.
In the statements during a breakfast of the Association of Directors and Executives of Aragón (ADEA), Olavarrieta explained that the concentration process is "at the highest possible speed and we must be very satisfied with the way it is achieved within the time frame set in the past, not now, in business plans with the Bank of Spain", he emphasized.
"The passage of 45 caisses with an average of 28,500 million asset volume to 17 with 75,500 million is an unparalleled trial in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% to be much larger to conform to Basel," he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there is a series of rather unfortunate opinions on the slowness of the process" which show "a lack of serosity and meaning", because "what the Bank of Spain is doing is to remind that the deadline must be respected before the end of the year".
The ECSC Director General, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday assured that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in all Europe and "probably" in the world and has attributed it to those who question it as a "lack of knowledge".
The leader mentioned that given the current economic situation, "we can stay very quiet" with the situation of financial entities and savings banks, a system that has begun a process of concentration "very important" and "go at the highest possible speed".
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector had taken advantage of the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the German red line
Berlin has chosen to remain in the euro, but it has established the conditions for the whole of the Union.
Market tensions have led to a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero announced new methods of adjustment, which vary from tax reductions for SMEs, regulation of private investment agencies or abolition of the EUR 426 of aid to unemployed people without a professional contribution to the privatization of 49% AENA, the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the State Lotteries.
On the other hand, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, joins the critics of Chancellor Angela Merkel with regard to her responsibility for detaching the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
It should be noted that Merkel's position is not a mistake in its communicative policy.
On the contrary, it is another restriction of the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what its future must be, which is shocking with that of maintaining the old traditions of most of its partners.
In the face of European resistance, we are beginning to speculate on the three possible exits from the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, incorporated by itself, Austria and Holland, among other countries, and the south would leave the monetary zone.
The second, Mark's recovery, even though it now seems to be science fiction, with a very favorable flow of opinion, nearly 50% of the population.
The third, a new concept of the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigour, fines to countries that transgress them, possible suspensions of payments from one of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and it has long been defined, so now there is no room for excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission were stimulating deficits, the German Government invented a constitutional reform to prevent them from starting in 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany thought we should do (a plan for fiscal rigour and stability of public finances) and what its European partners, including France, were doing.
The second round of the Central European country was when Merkel difficultly extended the decision to save Greece.
From this moment on, she was the subject of a fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion and the publication were against Greece's rescue.
Finally, by the end of October, Merkel once again expressed a clear position, calling for the reform of the Union's treaties to make it possible to rescue a country and at the same time oblige private lenders to bear a share of the cost.
This position was interpreted as anti-European because it has rushed the Irish crisis and the rest.
But his proposal, although somewhat sweetened, was approved and, in the coming months, we should attend the Union reform process that makes these measures possible from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not think to cross.
And she tells all of us that, although we must now take measures with which we may not be too much in agreement, from that date the former operation of the euro would have ended.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary zone, in which countries that break the rules will be severely punished, they may be forced to declare themselves in cessation of payments and, in that case, the private sector will also bear a portion of the costs.
Germany points out that we must follow a strict path of growth with high savings and investment rates, consumption moderation, productivity and competitiveness improvements and positive external balances.
An alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, such as the one that presided over Spanish growth in the boom years, will simply not be tolerated.
It's clear.
And it would be bad not to hear it.
It is not just about reducing the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What we're asked is much harder.
And what he must not do in these circumstances is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will bring us greater tranquillity.
And let us know how to grasp the opportunity we have been given, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also heard this form and his double statement (the reforms promised after the meeting of the past on Saturday with the big companies and the announcement of yesterday's new measures) suggests that, despite Merkel's critics, we have opened the way to the the thesis that it is necessary to order the house.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and they don't seem to move it.
And among the possibilities that are being considered, it cannot be excluded from giving up an overcrowded monetary area of less serious countries.
And in that case, Germany will always be able to tell us that she warned us.
Sports and fraud of the law
Ruses similar to that of Alonso and Ramos against Ajax demonstrate the ingenuity but not the will to escape a sanction.
In principle, the expulsion of gold by two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the 23 November match against Ajax in the League of Champions has caused a lot of ink on the anti-sportive character of such behaviour and whether the two players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As we know, just a few minutes before finishing the match (which their team already clearly won), the two players deliberately lost time when they made mistakes to determine the referee to show them the second yellow card.
Thus, and since Real Madrid will eventually be the leader of its group, the two players will perform the regulatory sanction during the next game of the dam game against Auxerre and will be able to pass without cards at the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee sanctioned with two matches the team coach José Mourinho and various economic sums to the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances such as this or similar is not a new practice, otherwise rather common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, the rules not written, but followed, of this sport.
Part of the debate in the related case is due to the fact that this has been the protagonist of a team of Real Madrid entity (who in his hymn displays nobility and honour and who on past occasions has condemned a fine to his players for similar acts) and orchestrated dramatization, it seems, by Mourinho, who adds an additional episode to his dilated history of hystrionic and provocative technicians.
In any case, the debate asks whether this type of behaviour does not expressly prohibit the principles of sport by regulation, i.e., whether with these actions there is a fraud of law; because, in fact, they are actions that are in compliance with the rules of sport, but seem to circumvent its meaning.
The question is to examine the type of damage they cause to the sports spirit.
One of the assets that understands the sports spirit is the physical integrity of the opposing players, an aspect that with these actions has not been put at risk, that is, there has been no violent play.
Another of the goods to which we allude with the correct game is to prevent the team from taking advantage of the opposing team in an unfair way, which is not the case either.
However, the paradoxical fact of the action of Real Madrid players is that it does not fit that it is normally characterized as trickery or fraud of the law, because its violation of the rules has not been carried out in secret to try to avoid punishment, but their action has precisely tried to be as obvious as possible to receive the criminalization of the arbitrator.
They were waiting, and they gladly accepted the penalty.
Another issue is the type of advantage that offenders obtain from the deliberate errors examined.
Here, it seems necessary to note that we do not put the rival in a situation of disadvantage and we do not get an advantage in the same game either, because of course the result of the action involves leaving their own team with fewer players.
And it's not a useful strategy for the next game either, because the club couldn't count on these players.
Of course, the advantage is that players will begin the next phase of the Champions League without cardboards that can threaten their participation in a future match.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indetermination, because the team could be eliminated suddenly and apart from this, with this action players perform a penalty match and pass into the second cycle of cardboard, in which the suspension due to the accumulation of cards occurs with one less than the first cycle.
So, stepping up the steps, it's not so clear that it's an advantage.
In the end, these actions are not contrary to the sports spirit, of which the strategic decision-making that promotes the maximum benefit of what the rules allow.
In our case, the players did not act to avoid the application of the penalty (it would indeed be a clear case of fraud of the law), but otherwise they chose rather the time when they submitted to it.
They made a strategic decision without making any penalty or escaping it.
Although the boundary between engineering and the fraud of the law is widespread, on that occasion I think we have had a clear case of engineering.
The controversy appears to me because of two factors: because there were two self-expulsion and because of how to transmit the director to provoke them.
The harm caused by the principles of sport by these actions is not as ethical as aesthetic.
Offensive offers to capture Christmas dinners for groups in NCBs
The dictatorship of the calendar concentrates this year an avalanche of reservations for the 16th and 17th days.
There is a proliferation of self-funded celebrations by employees who wish to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the bull and the lottery, when December comes, there are also groups dinners before Christmas that continue to be the oxygen balloon for Barcelona's restaurants and entertainment, but which because of the crisis have led to an offensive your price adjusted to be able to capture the majority customer: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros in dinners or meals, coincide with businessmen and associations of the interviewed sector.
To complete to complicate the accounting, this year's calendar (as the night of the Holy Sylvestre falls on Friday) concentrated the requests in the week of December 13, resulting up to now an avalanche of dinner reservations for the peak days (the 17th and the 17) and almost nothing in the previous week.
Since 2008, which is the origin of difficult times, there are many companies that have eliminated collective dinners for budgetary reasons.
To maintain tradition, many employees organize them by paying their own pockets.
No matter what the conjuncture is, they all ask for battle prices, confirms the President of Gremi de Restoration de Barcelona, Gaietà Farres.
The representative of the employer, now, does not dare to predict how this month's parties will be.
"People think a lot before they reserve."
"They want to go out but they pay a lot of attention to the prizes," he says.
The case will go well "for those who give quality at good prices and with good service," he adds, and recalls that customers tend to go down a step with the crisis, so the tranche around the 25 euros has become a majority in demand.
In a survey at various institutions in the centre, the collapsing of requests for the night of 17.
The Soteras group indicates that there is an authentic demand boom on this Friday, with the claim to spend less than 30 euros, to which they responded by adapting their menus to the environment, with complete formulae from 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another group of the most powerful, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the particularity of the calendar assumed more anticipated reservations, even as early as November.
"We did the impossible to maintain the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes from 19,95 to 30 euros," they explain.
AN Group, which includes El Mussol, Attic, Ququ and a total of 23 premises, remains optimistic after detecting an increase in billing since the second half and good, although concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources of the group mention that the 18 will also be a hyper-active day at the level of groups of friends who celebrate in advance the parties.
At their six group menus they added one for Christmas, with 30 euros or more as a famous budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend 10% more than last year instead of demanding more details, such as Catalan wine produced according to the champagne - 'cava' method.
They also see the first signs of improvement in some companies again inviting their employees and the feeling that the volume of the groups has increased somewhat.
On the part of the patronate Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Entertainment of Barcelona), his Vice-President, Henry Gomà, trusts in the possibility of starting to see the end of the tunnel and supports that overall reservations are "animated", even though customers "negotiate as much as possible".
Indeed, the hope for holidays has not been lowered, regardless of who pays, he says.
The Pakistani nuclear programme is causing great concern to the United States
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at "a faster pace than any other country".
Wikileaks leaks confirm the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the American Embassy of Pakistan and the Department of State of the United States filtered by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns caused by the Pakistani nuclear programme in Washington.
Apart from the enlightening and tasty details on the content of the talks and thoughts of North American diplomatic representatives accredited to Islamabad, the documents reveal the fact that cooperation between the two countries in the area of atomic security, rather than increasing, "decreasing" and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "at a faster rate than any other country in the world".
The peculiarity of the Pakistani nuclear programme - the fact that weapons are not assembled, but are stored by components to make their destruction difficult in case of attack - is one of the main causes of concern in Washington.
Thus, the ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, lists in a report prior to the visit of the former National Security Advisor, James Jones: "The proximity of certain nuclear installations in the territory under attack Taliban, the dispersion of nuclear materials whose short noise and vulnerability to the transport of atomic materials".
The large number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is envisaged, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, as proliferating and a reason to maintain custody.
"Pakistan has to hire staff with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the decline in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who work in nuclear or missile programs," said expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs during a meeting with his American counterparts.
The new documentation filtered by Julian Assange's portal is the ever-increasing cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and Pakistan's high level of nuclear weapons production.
An Ambassador's expedition in May, which calls communication with Pakistan as "frustant", supports the following: "Transparency is often non-existent; offers of aid remain unanswered or are eliminated".
In another message, Peter Lavoy, official of the National Intelligence for South Asia, notes that "despite the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster pace than any other country in the world".
Ambassador Patterson also asks Washington, during a visit by the Chief of the Army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to make it "very clear" to the person responsible that "the Pakistani Army must end with tacit support to terrorist groups".
Hunting the chief of Wikileaks
Obama will count on a senior counter-terrorism officer to avoid new infiltrations.
Interpol issues a red alert to track movements and locate Assange.
All aspects related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, form a complicated labyrinth where it is difficult to have certainty about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "localize and follow the movements" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
In addition, it is not new, otherwise dated November 20.
And it has nothing to do with the last leak of more than a quarter of a million diplomatic documents from the United States, but with the accusations of sexual abuse that Australians face in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks' creative lawyer, Mark Stephens, ensures that "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange."
On the 20th, the international police force with the seat in Lyon, France, issued the order at the request of Sweden, but did not make it public until yesterday, after receiving the authorization of the authorities of that country.
Thus, the 188 countries of Interpol received the indication of identifying or locating Assange "to obtain its provisional arrest and extradition".
Although Interpol cannot give the arrest order of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, according to the organization's explanations, consider the red appeal a free route for arrest -- that the national police force must carry out -- especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England, where Assange is thought to be located.
The movement outraged Assange's lawyers, who yesterday issued a letter denouncing the fact that the founder of Wikileaks, 39, was willing to respond by video-conference to the questions of the Swedish authorities.
They also recall that Assange sought and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which is compared to the famous Lavrenty Pavlovich Beria, head of Stalin's security.
"This seems to be a hunt, not a legal persecution," he denounces the missile.
While the world seeks him - and in Australia his mother defends his son's innocence - Assange continues to find himself in an unknown place, but he doesn't sit.
On Monday he granted an indefinite interview to the director of Time magazine through Skype, a conversation in which he requested the resignation of the Secretary of State of the United States, Hillary Clinton.
"If we can show that she has been responsible for giving orders to U.S. graduates that they spy on the United Nations by violating the international treaties that the United States has signed, she should resign," he said.
His opinion was insulted yesterday by the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, who described the application for resignation as "ridiculous and absurd".
"I'm not sure why a guy's opinion with a web page should interest us," he said to the CNN.
Obama himself commissioned a senior anti-terrorist leader, Rusell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama's test of reducing the importance of Assange's contrast with the views that conservative politicians and commentators have proclaimed these days.
Peter King, the congressman who will be chairing the National Security Committee in the Lower House from January requested the Department of State to study the possibility of including Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations "to confiscate its funds and prosecute any person providing them with contributions or assistance".
Even further went Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, who had to return to his statements after saying that Assange should be "murdered."
"Obama should turn it into a goal and use an unmanned plane or something."
One person who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist Minister, former Governor of Arkansas and possible candidate for the presidency.
"He who is in the Government who has leaked the information is guilty of treason and anything other than execution would be too kind a punishment," he said for Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in the ERC with eye clinks to the followers of Carod
The Republican leader will allow the party to vote in secret on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to solve the huge internal revolt within ERC, without the north due to the loss of 11 MPs and half of the votes.
The party president is aware of the fact that his threat of resignation is not sufficient for the followers of former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now as diluted as his liar and that it cannot at all give him any headaches he had with other extinct currents.
For this reason, the leader of Escarra will try to win his new criticisms with eye clinks that allow him to shine up to the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national ERC advisors will be able to decide on its continuity in secret.
By balloting, not by raising your hand.
If the Karodists want to cast a certain vote of penalty on the President, they will be able to do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the leader wants to avoid the image of division and the image of submission to his or her person.
In several interviews he claimed that he would not consider himself ratified with half plus one of the votes, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, that a result "in Bulgarian" would not be good either.
People close to Carod require the president a little more than making his position available for the military, a gesture that is not worth when Puigcercós controls the maximum organ between the congresses.
But since they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will try to approve a road map with the executive until May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the development of the strategic reorientation document that management will submit to the vote of the National Council on 18.
Its intention is to support Puigcercós in exchange for its promise to schedule the Congress for the fall of 2011, which the leaders consider to be a safe fact.
The leader of ERC has admitted that "polyphony" affects stability and its goal is to make once for all the organization capable of washing its linen family room.
In this line, the article that the current advisor Josep Huguet signed in his blog is symptomatic.
Considered Puigcercós' ideologue, the holder of Innovació thought that the fact that the leader will be ratified "in exchange for various objectives" is as if it had been done.
And he listed five, of which he highlights two.
The first, "recomprising" the executive to represent at least 90% of the military, i.e., include new figures from the Carod field.
The second may be the character of great news.
Huguet proposes that liquid ERC for once for all assembly as a mechanism of operation.
Thus, it advocates a reform of the statutes that allows for the realization of the conventions through elected delegates by suffrage.
Ending with the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, was an obsession with the Puigcercós team, which has already fought in this direction in the last two conventions.
In fact, the 2008 Conclave was responsible for reviewing the model of assembly at a specific Congress on Statutory Reform.
This meeting remains unfinished, as the internal tide of recent years did not recommend addressing this issue.
Now, without critical sectors at the bottom, the time could be good to take it back and close it forever.
23 executed in November; 290 in 2010
According to MILENIO of the State of Mexico, there was a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
In November, 23 people were executed in the State of Mexico, four less than the previous month according to MILENIO of the State of Mexico.
Among the murders are these three women and the discovery of two bodies cut off in the Valley of Mexico.
In the past month of the year, 390 deaths were recorded in organized crime theory.
Among the cases is that of a body found in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, municipality of Toluca.
The subject had at least three shots of firearm and the stroke of grace to the head, apart from the feet and hands attached to a cable.
The next day, the body of a subject was found in a suitcase inside the trunk of an abandoned vehicle in the Mistecas Street in the Colonia Santa Cruz Acatlán, of the municipality of Naucalpan.
Very early on Thursday morning, the four owners of land exploited in common found a body with signs of torture and at least three shots of lethal fire in the thorax, on the highway near Calmao-Ixtapan de la Sal, in the area that crosses the municipality Villa Guerrero.
Close to the body we found a message signed in theory by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
A day after Nezahualcoyotl, a 50-year-old gentleman was killed with eight shots of fire when he left his home to initiate the work of collecting orders.
On 7 November, two subjects of 30 years of age were killed by a head-fire impact in the colony San Pedro Xaloxtoc, the city of Ecatepec.
In Chalco, with the shot of grace in the front one found a man's body on a lonely path from Colonia El Naranjo and under the body one found a percut bullet of caliber firearm 25.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the black water channel of the Plaza Golondrina colony.
The emergency bodies did a thorough search of the rest of the body members, but they were not found.
The residents of Tepotzotlán warned about the discovery of a corpse located in Peña Colorada, the hands tied behind and the eyes bandaged.
The man had a gunshot wound in his neck.
The execution of two men who had been wrapped up in blankets and abandoned in the trunk of a vehicle in the streets of the Villas de la Hacienda department in the Atizapán municipality of Zaragoza was reported half a month, and two death warning messages were discovered at the same time with the victims.
One day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony, in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby colony we found the rest of the body wrapped in a black plastic bag with a message signed by L'Incorrigible.
On the 17th, wrapped in blankets, two women were found in the Zoquiapan hamlet of the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the following morning the corpse of a man was located in Huixquilucan who had been wrapped in a yellow and blue cover, being in principle identified with the name Mario Ríos, according to a message that his executioners had left beside him.
In Ixtapaluca, with gunshots in the neck one found the lifeless body of a woman in the hamlet of San Francisco Acuautla.
On the woman's skin it was detected tattoos of Santa Muerte and necklaces with her image.
By the end of the month, a man's dead body was found on the edge of a car in the municipality of Zinacantepec with at least three bullet impacts and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the corpses of two men with the head of trouble and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies there was a message signed in principle by a criminal organization, which said, "This is what happens to those who do not align themselves."
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and with hands and feet attached, two bodies were found inside an abandoned taxi behind the Justice Centre of the San Agustín Colony.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcoyotl.
The first of them had been beheaded in the colony Cuchilla Ancón and had been wrapped in black plastic bags, attached with a cinnamon ribbon and a message next to it; while the second had been tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Near him, the officers found a Bristol with a message.
China maintains targets for reducing greenhouse gases
The representative of that country at COP16 assured that his country had made tremendous efforts to reduce the coal footprint and detailed that it maintained its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to 2020 by 40-45 percent.
China maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 per cent by 2020, Su Wei, a representative of China at COP16, said.
In its first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce the coal trail and to re-convert its industry.
In fact, he explained, over the past four years, his country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Nevertheless, it made it clear that China will not change its objectives, but will continue to work together with the international community in this area.
He noted that the Chinese climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity building; institution building; and support for pilot programmes.
Progress has been made in all these areas, including last year's approval of a new Energy Act, which recognizes the objectives of reducing greenhouse gases, he explained.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, federal authorities worked in a coordinated way with governments and locals to achieve energy saving, efficient energy use and emission reduction goals.
In addition, he stated that there are various multi-year plans under way or completed, both funded by the Chinese Government and by the governments of other countries.
For example, he mentioned the Energy Effective Use Programme, which has been implemented over the past five years and has received investments from the United Nations (UN), the Government and the private initiative.
There is also a provincial climate change project, another for the change of filament lamps by saving lamps and another for mitigation and adaptation, it has detailed.
At the same table, Martin Krol, a scientific adviser to the Government of that country on climate change, assured that China's efforts were greater than we thought.
For example, the per capita emission of greenhouse gases in China is three tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9% of the historical contribution to contamination.
Similarly, it has made unprecedented efforts in the use of energy, how to increase energy efficiency by 20% in the last five years and plans to do something similar by 2020, he said.
Legal expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The NAP national leader has detailed that the former Panist leader has the right to appeal to the National Order Commission for what is right.
The national leader of PAN, César Nava Vázquez, has ensured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos has been legal and that the former Panist leader has the right to appeal to the National Order Commission for what is right.
In the interview prior to the protest of Gabino Cué Monteagudo as governor of the state, he said that in any case, the expulsion of Espino is a decision adopted at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Sonora Order Commission."
"Mr Espino has the right, if necessary, to make a claim to the National Council Order Commission, so that it is a decision taken within a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he clarified that this is not the time to think about 2012 and there has never been an alliance on the negotiating table for the presidential candidacy.
Nava Vázquez expressed his conviction that the National Action would be stronger after the internal elections on 4 and 5 December where a successor should be elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is an aspect that has never been on the negotiating table, at least for the moment, it has been an approach for the local elections that has been successful and achieved its goal," he said.
The Panist leader mentioned that NAP has been supported by 71 years of dialogue, which is why "internal competition does not scare us; on the contrary, "we will taste it and make us stronger," he said.
He said that the council will probably be able to elect the best leader that National Action needs for the next three years, so it would give rise to "the person determined by the Council."
"I am completely quiet and open, I would be proud to leave the party president's office to any of the five."
He planned that the relaunch recorded by the party in the last elections on 4 July would be reflected in the next dispute, even if "it is not yet time to think about 2012."
"At the moment it is about accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments that emanate from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for observation throughout the country, so that we have become "many hopes for them, and I am sure Gabino will be up to expectations".
When asked about PRI's criticisms against President Felipe Calderón for his speech during his four years of government, César Nava asked the priests to reflect on the six years of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo y Salinas were better than those of Fox y Calderón; they begin to defend them; they come out of 'armoire'," he said.
He stated that the holder of the Federal Executive can make expressions like those he made in his speech in the National Auditorium, because there is no whipping in the country, and even less censorship.
Obama promotes the law for paperless students on Twitter
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call on your senators and ask them to approve this legislation," tweeted the US President in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama has now met with national mobilization to support the Dream Act, to legalize students without papers, with a message in his personal account of the Twitter social network.
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to approve this legislation," said Twitter Obama.
Its short message maintains an open cyberlink to a broader document that requires the public to contact senators immediately, as voting in legislation is imminent.
"With a vote we hope soon, now is the time to listen to your voice," he said.
The message was disclosed after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote on any legislation if the extension of tax reductions in Bush's time and government funding continued.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote in the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned about the Republican Blocking of the Dream Act and other projects, Presidential Spokesman Robert Gibbs stated that he is confident that once the tax problem is resolved an agenda for the rest of the projects will be established.
"I think we have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that this fiscal problem must be resolved by the end of the year..."
"I think we can get an agreement at some point in this direction and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
The leader of the majority democrat of the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that he was going to ask for a "closure vote" for the Dream Act, which is why the initiative to legalize students without papers could be voted on next Thursday in the Senate, even if it would be most likely next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or the American Rêve Act would legalize 800,000 young people who arrived in the United States before the age of 16, remained in that country for the last five years and were accepted by a higher education institution or by the Army.
But supporters require 60 votes to approve the initiative, which is why they require the support of a large number of Republicans, at times when the partisan organizations of the project are heavily lobbying to ensure the approval of the Act.
The Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
Nevertheless, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against and only one Republican expressed his support for the law, Richard Placer of Indiana.
That is why the Dream Act supporters require several Republicans to vote if other Democrats decide to vote against the initiative.
Senators Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins among the most court-married Republicans, and Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed his term of office, Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they have said they will not support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported him, John McCain, has not yet defined his position.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the biggest obstacles in the Dream Act are in the Senate.
With the literature you put your finger on the wound
The second stage of the Language Pleasures was a walk in which participants ran the story
"The sex in the language, I understand it, but... the finger on the plague? what do you expect from me?" asked the guest writer Luisa Valenzuela to open the second stage of the Pleasures of the language, a cycle that celebrates the literature in Spanish and that this time used the caption of his question (pending another fair the round table was dedicated to the Sexe in the language, she explained).
The finger on the plague"...it puts us in embarrassment," the Argentine writer launched slowly to the public, most of the young people, who had met at the International Book Fair of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this table moderated by Marisol Shuultz and attended by Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio that Shultz defined after as a great story, with Luisa in first person as a protagonist who seeks to know what the "plaie" is, she goes from one doctor to another, without getting a reply, only tracks in the same narrative thread.
From the infectiologist she is convinced: " patience is not my strength, it may be my plague."
In the end, after a frustrated man approaches with the traumatologist who cut his breath in the middle of the corridor, but who explains to him that plague is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the plague is what is actually open, the symbolic is the scar".
The protagonist sighed and concluded: "On the wound I could only know that it is open in reality and that it does not exist", but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the tongue must be very linked to each other.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a dazzling narrative he called Eloge à l'invention, where the finger on the plague is not numbered but at some point is discovered.
With the touch of magical realism, he speaks of a famous insorcer that touched the clouds, brought back people who had gone far away or repaired the virtues that a young lady had lost, a narrative that turned to speak America, the great news that had from the beginning her own chroniclers and quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticized the excesses of the narratives of the conquering captains.
"Cerrants who invented us all (the writers) mocked the false witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but in a way they would never have contained the history of America with an imagination that even lacked the stink."
Nevertheless, he stressed, "foolish and liars have the best imagination" and here the reality converges with the lie, we no longer know what part of the narrative belongs to one band or another, where the fiction literature reaches its height.
This is actually called the 'Tradition of Cervantes'.
"It is because of his inheritance that we are what we tell."
In turn, writer Mayra Montyero annotated and applauded the variety of interpretations caused by the invitation of the FIL with its round table due on the wound.
The Cuban-Portoricaine has put its own on the great plague of social violence that its country is experiencing - and Latin America shares - produces disputes about trafficking and the sale of drugs.
"I think that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit commitment that is not of course premeditated," she said, after quoting that the reality of literature is the communication and the dimension of the commitment between the author and readers, and that it is a "chemical reaction" of the author.
The evening ended with the intervention of the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, who also pointed out "this must be on the wound of the committed writer".
He considered that in a world that lives at high speed also with regard to intellectual habits and the control of consciences that turn to the advantage of dogmatisms, "last every assertion there is a small no and behind every negation there is a small yes".
"To be the masters of our own feelings and to be the masters of reality, we must nuance: and nuance means many times to put the finger on the plague and to disturb people who feel very comfortable thinking about caricature, in black and white, in established ideas and without nuance and also to disturb the powers that prefer a world in black and white," he said, inviting them to recover the sense of writing.
Roman to the hunting of his first title
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in the finals he had tops and bottoms in his career, but he managed to reach three times the decisive series.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, there are also two different styles that compete, marked by their technicians, which find between them a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in finals, he had tops and bottoms in his career, but he managed to reach three times the decisive series, even though so far he has not put in the thousand and that is why this opportunity is very special for him.
Argentina finally consoled itself with the sub-champion medal, he remained one step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he played consecutive endings.
The sanctistic strategy came to its first finish as coach in the 2002 Opening Tournament, when he held the reigns of Morelia with which he lost with a overall result of 4-2 against Toluca; later, in the 2003 Closing he also arrived at the decisive duel and lost again with the overall result of 3-1 and this was precisely against Rayados.
With Santos Laguna already, in the 2010 Bicentenary Tournoi, again against the Devils, Rubén suffered again a reverse, because his team made an equal match of 2-2 against the Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the series of penalties he got an advantage for 3-1 with two opportunities to get the title and finally three of his players missed 11 meters and he suffered the jump at the result of 4-3.
Rubén lost two finals with the Red Devils and one with Monterrey, his rival to the tournament, therefore he does not want to have the same fate, he tries to detach himself from the evil so he can celebrate for the first time a title, even though he claims that for him the institution is more important.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break any statistics, it's for a club, not for a passion that I have and therefore I will get the title, but what I mentioned earlier is more important," said the helmsman when he was asked what his weak points would be in the finals.
He remembers a lot of the final, of which he assures that he has learned a lot, "the only lesson that we can hold is that until the referee does not feel the end, we cannot celebrate, we are prepared in the line, the players too, because last time, with two penalties to draw us were already prepared to run and I believe that this is a lesson, before the end of the game we cannot celebrate".
He knows that this series could be defined by penalties, which does not worry him, because he trusts his players: "We never try to get to the set of penalties, we try to finish in the regular time, but sometimes we just have to prepare, the previous tournament we have been prepared, unfortunately fate has made a bad turn, sometimes it is the emotions or the anxiety of holding the title in our hands, it has escaped us, it has served us as a lesson for this final and we hope that we will no longer get in this situation."
Romano now has the opportunity to be no longer a sub-champian technician and to taste for the first time the glory offered by the titles.
The European Union changes the rules for obtaining visa
People should go to Visa Applicants Service before interviewing the Consular Section; waiting time will be reduced.
From 10 January 2011 the visa processing procedure at the United States Embassy and consulates will change.
With the new procedure, the majority of applicants will be required to report to the Visa Applicants Service (ASC) prior to their interview in the Consular Section.
CSA staff will take the applicant's biometric information, which will be revised by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will provide some benefits for applicants, including the following:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, it will no longer be necessary to make a payment to obtain an appointment, another payment for processing the visa and another payment for the mail service to deliver the document.
The vacuum cleaner will make a single payment that will cover all three services.
The current rate will remain the same: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visas with demand (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for visas for traders and investors.
Those who wish to renew their visas will not have to attend an interview with the Consular Representative, they will only present themselves at the nearest CSA where they will present the documents and take their fingerprints.
Due to the fact that biometric information will be collected in the CSA, applicants who want a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will remain there less time than before.
Similarly, visa applicants for the Consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra service fee of 26 dollars.
For further information on the new procedure for applying for the visa, please visit the following page: http://mexico.usbassy.gov/boletins/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA will announce the discovery of extraterrestrial life
The U.S. space agency cited the press to present tomorrow a discovery that will have an impact on the search for living things in space.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States will communicate tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery, which could prove the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented at a press conference tomorrow Thursday, at 13:00 a.m. NASA headquarters in Washington for astrobiology experts, the science that studies the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
When she quoted the press, NASA assured her that she would present who would have an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life," which led to speculation by experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures similar to us and in hostile environments that were thought to be uninhabited and would put on the table the possibility of becoming intelligent beings like humans if their living conditions were improved.
It seems that we are talking about a microbe discovered at the bottom of the Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, which lives in an environment that was thought too poisonous for any form of life, because the lake is rich in arsenic.
In any case, the creature uses arsenic as a way of living and this ability makes us think that a similar life could exist on other planets that do not have our voluntary atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it proves that "there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from the one we know".
The space agency will communicate the true scope of the discoveries at the press conference tomorrow, Thursday.
The conference will participate in Pamela Conrad's geobiology, which studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (Saturne's largest satellite), from the perspective that his chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
Germe PRD, PT, Convergence and Opposition Block Pattern
With reforms to the Organic Law of Congress, we make possible the arrival of 'bipartism', we denounce it.
The 60th century had just settled in when an opposing bloc had appeared in Congress led by PRD, PT, Convergence and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who declared himself independent and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of 'bipartism' in the Chambers.
Before initiating the installation session of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergence; Ezequiel Reinoso Esparza of PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo of PRD; and Patrón Montalvo 'toned' against the reform of the Organic Law, since it excluded them,
With this reform, they reiterated, we started 'bipartism' because now there are two people, of the same number of parties, who control Congress.
These four deputies, alongside Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of PRD, were the only ones to vote against the Director-in-Office of the Paniste Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, as Vice-President.
Corvera Quevedo mentioned that with these reforms institutionally we are the political marginality of PRI and PAN.
He mentioned that in the following days they would speak to the representatives of PAN and PRI to modify the scheme by giving political will and if they do not, they will again be served by both parties and thus end the opposing coalition.
"So far it has arrived (the opposing coalition), that is what I look at, because we are excluded, from any decision, they do not even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, de Convergencia mentioned that with PRD, PT and Patrón there are coincidences and that is why they form a plural group.
We cannot afford, he continued, that Congress, after having been monopolistic, is now "duopolic".
"This is not the spirit of reforming the law that there is eternal bipartism in Congress."
To begin with, this group starts with 5 legislators and now they talk to other colleagues to make them more numerous, added the Convergent.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, from PT, explained that the Congress has now become a 'good' between two, alluding to PAN and PRI.
"Before there was only one party, now they divide it between two."
Patrón Montalvo asked to respect the Member's personality, to give him his place at the negotiating tables.
"That they do not leave us with cupular agreements out of 5 which will probably be 9 Members, now to the five we see, separated into different fractions, we have decided to join ourselves to find a place in the negotiating table, that is the problem, that in the reform they have made, that they have decided, we are outside and we do not agree with that reform."
$200 million more for "the supplier"
The Mairie de Mazatlán pays another check to the company's alleged owner of electrical equipment.
Another check of about 200 miles pesos favors Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the Mayor.
With the latter, the amount that was paid this second semester to the owner of the electrical equipment company is 1 million 200 thousand pesos.
According to the Municipality's transparency page, the latter cheque number 9258447 was issued last November 16 for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, in concept of "liquidation of account suppliers".
The Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had said that the Commune would pay other amounts to this supplier, which was observed by the State's Upper Hearing to sell at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total debt and therefore how many cheques will still be issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"We didn't buy anything, we just pay him what we owe him, like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: on September 24, two on October 15, October 19, October 29 and November 16th.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal of the State, as predicted in the Act when a company is questioned by ASE, to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasurer has ensured that they have not used its services again.
All of this, after 25 July Northwest had published a revision of the cheques that the Municipality issues to its suppliers, revealing that in the interval March 2008 - July 2010, in the triennate of the Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the Municipality to pay Camacho Palazuelos over 10 million pesos, through 42 cheques.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, cashing cheques of more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites must be treated
Tourist entrepreneurs regret the accident of the foreign tourist due to the bad conditions of the Sánchez Taboada roundabout in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a creek of the Sánchez Taboada roundabout, the tourism sector in Mazatlán asked the authorities to pay attention to areas and sites that are in poor condition and to project a poor image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association des Commerçants de Zona Dorada, recalled that they have repeatedly called for the image of the destination to be taken care of and new activities to replace others that tourists find bad.
He said that the poor condition of the streets and sidewalks has affected because tourists come to walk there and see the disorder and avoid close trades.
"Politics do not know what it means to close a business one day and they do not know how much wealth we lose, elsewhere they did not do the work for so long and without proper planning."
Hostile José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the tourist's downfall exposed the Mairie's lack of prevention and maintenance.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and prevent it from happening again, how to do so, so through a preventive interview and not only do the corrective thing," he said.
"We want to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist zone, but as inhabitants who deserve a clean place to live in it and the Mayor has to change his strategy to keep the city well."
There are other sites that are neglected and incomplete, he said, such as Escudo and Venadito de Mazatlan.
"Today, because the tourist comes, it does not only depend on the promotion, there must be a good product, a city that has cleanliness in its beaches, boulevards, permanent maintenance of tourist attractions," he said.
"They have not been given the attention they need and this type of fact emphasizes something that is notorious for all, maintenance is necessary."
Raúl Llera Martínez, under Secretary of Tourism Promotion, stated that the recovery of tourist sites in Mazatlán is urgent, because they are not used properly and project a bad image.
He spoke of a series of places that must be put together with the city and be a priority to have the city up-to-date, clean, orderly and attractive because it has a tourist vocation.
"Mazatlán is fortunately offering many historical and cultural sites and sites that should be ordered first, cleaned up and put on line to make them attractive so that they can be added to the inventory that we have to promote this destination."
IP demand for results at Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CEC, proposed that Members assume the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations it faces.
The Mazatlán business sector calls for a law of decent work and free of agreement between the parties and the Government's Executive, because Sinaloa is confused and confronts major problems.
Yesterday the 60th Congress was set up by seven political forces, 19 MPs of PRI, 13 PAN, three from the New Alliance Party, two from PRD, one from PT, one from Convergence and one from PVEM, a total of 40 people representatives.
The list of expectations that the new members of the government Congress is a clean and committed management with society and the various sectors that require responsible legislative work and that the same models of party spirit or paternalism do not repeat.
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CEC, proposed that Members assume the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations it faces.
"We hope that Members will actually exercise their right, free of agreement between the parties, because the custom is that they make pacts to ensure their own interests and turn themselves into carnival masks of the governors and leaders of the parliamentary fractions."
That is why I ask them to certify the commitment to establish the necessary bridges that the current Governor is making progress.
"We will ensure that they do a decent job and, above all, engage with society and sectors as the people of Sinaloa gave them their vote of confidence in the past elections.
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Association des Hôtels Tres Islas, considered one of the major provocations of the 40 popular representatives to push and add forces seeking economic growth in the state, as the economic situation is now very complicated.
"The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, that they generate incentives for investment and infrastructure, and that in a way will stimulate the generation of jobs."
With regard to tourism, he requested that the new legislators give him the importance of the Government's budget to consolidate the Secretariat of Government Tourism.
"I have understood that it is the second State Secretariat with a lower budget and it is incongruous as an important economic activity that generates currencies and investments and that competes directly with the agro-industry."
Apart from the fact that it is necessary to classify resources to detonating tourism projects that help secure the state and update the Alcohol Act that previous legislations have not been able to resolve.
We're looking for king mages
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the desire of the children of the family Coronado Valenzuela.
For their parents, the next day of the Magi will be difficult to fulfill their illusions, because their home is formed by no more than 12 people and a goat.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaias, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchior, Balthazar and Gaspard will bring them the toys and clothing they want so much.
The family lives in a humble house of Colonia Salvador Allende and they live in the day because their father does not have a stable job.
"Sometimes it's very difficult for us, because my husband doesn't have a job, but we sell mandarins and potatoes...and in the afternoon I leave with the 'plebes' for sale on the street," says Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Adelaida, 4 years old, wants a doll or a bicycle, and her sister Isabel, 3 years old, would like a Barbie doll.
In turn, 10-year-old José Alfredo aspires for a long time to have a 'monster truck' and for his little brother Jesus, 8 months old, Cayetana suggests clothing of size for a year.
"He told me (José Alfredo), 'I'd like to have this monster', but I told him 'we'll see, my son', because he was very expensive', he remembers with sadness Cayetana.
For older children, who were at school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
María Guadalupe, 11 years old, shoes the size 12; Isaiah, 10 years old, shoes the size 10, while Michael, 8 years old, shoes the size eight.
José Juan, aged 14, needs a pair of sports shoes, so a pair of size five and a half or six would help him a lot.
If you want to help make reality the dream of the children of the family Coronado Valenzuela you can participate in the campaign On Search King Mage, giving a toy or money to the reception of Northwest.
14 alleged drug traffickers arrested
Some ten searches were carried out in Estrie, Wednesday, as part of the dismantling of a cannabis production and sales network.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The raids took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places that would have been used for drug production.
"About 750 plants of cannabis, four kilos of hasch, money and production equipment have been seized," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, Spokesperson of the Quebec Security.
In all, eleven men and three women were arrested, including the two alleged leaders of this network, two Sherbrooke men.
The arrested persons were to appear at Sherbrooke's courthouse within hours of their arrest.
They could face charges of cannabis production, possession for the purpose of trafficking, conspiracy and service theft, among others.
These investigations took place following a long-term investigation, which lasted almost a year.
"It was information received from the public that allowed us to make these arrests," said Ruel.
Some 70 police officers from the Regional Investigation Module of the Quebec Security Estrie, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphremagog Police Board, participated in this police operation.
Underground migration can continue smoothly
The draft law of the Conservatives, which, according to the government, should address the problem of vessels loaded with illegal migrants, is obviously going to be beaten while the three opposition parties informed Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I rely heavily on the Charter."
"I stand with a party that created the granite under your feet," Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff said, while he was surrounded by deputies after the weekly meeting of the caucus.
Liberals claim that the proposed bill, which would allow any person from a vessel identified as carrying clandestine immigrants to hold up to one year, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The head of the Quebec Block, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the bill, because he took the wrong target.
"We are against and it seems that all opposition parties are against, so we will see what the government will do," said Duke.
The NPD's immigration criticism, Olivia Chow, rejected criticism from the backs of his hand that his party was not strong enough for illegal immigrants.
"The New Democrats agree to take action against smugglers, and that is what we do through another Bill, C-35," said Mrs Chow.
"We do not support the Conservative bill because it takes up refugees and imprisons children for at least a year," explained Chow.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"Canadians massively tell MPs that they do not tolerate such clandestine migration, these criminal operations that target Canada and treat the country as a clown."
"They expect Canada to take firm action," said Minister Kenney.
The government has not announced a vote of confidence on its bill, which could have led the country to elections that would have been rejected.
However, a Conservative told the QMI Agency that the government would request a vote so that each member who would oppose would then explain himself to its electors.
The new unit does not unanimize
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a permanent unit to combat corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the establishment of a public inquiry commission on the subject.
The Minister of Public Safety, Robert Dutil, argues that this idea did not date yesterday: Quebec would have consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this issue since January.
The Metropolis has a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
However, Tuesday's announcement surprised more than one.
It must be said that at a meeting of the Permanent Council on Police Services in Quebec on 29 October, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
It was no longer necessary for the Pakistani public security critique, Stéphane Bergeron, to qualify this announcement as a "pain out of a hat" and a "bricked solution on the corner of a table".
The Minister Dutil has responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the possible future unity.
"You're going to see the result when we announce it, he's just saying."
"We are aware of that problem."
For the President of the CSQ, Rejean Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of a public investigation.
"The more Mr Charest refuses to create this commission of inquiry, the more people think like you and me that he has something to hide," he explains.
"The only way to have an inquiry commission is to resign Jean Charest," says Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To get out of this deadlock, he therefore suggests that Quebec give a special mandate to the Auditor General to investigate collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the Auditor General," he said.
He also believes that Quebec could give the auditor the same powers as a Commissioner, thus allowing him to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent scuude is not the only project in Charest government cartons.
Quebec would also ask Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code in order to be better suited to this type of crime.
This request would come from Operation Marteau's prosecutor, who informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that case law is not explicit in such investigations.
The Federal Minister of Public Safety, Vic Toews, has confirmed that his Justice colleague, Rob Nicholson, is currently considering certain amendments related to this matter.
During Operation Spring 2001, which struck the engine groups, even though the Criminal Code was not adapted, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently passed the Gastrosterism Act.
Rivers under high surveillance
Several watercourses remain under high surveillance due to heavy rainfall that has occurred in several regions of the province since Tuesday.
A landslide occurred Wednesday afternoon in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
Two houses were evacuated in a preventive manner.
In the evening, another slip would have occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
A road has fallen apart.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rainfall fell over several regions, from 40 to 70 millimetres of rain.
Additional 20 to 40 millimetres of rain were expected by Thursday night, depending on the regions.
The areas north of the river and in the Outaouais Valley were the most affected.
They could receive up to 100 millimetres of total rain.
As these precipitations should be added to the source of the snow already accumulated in some sectors, there is a fear of overflowing several streams.
Notices of flood alert were issued on Wednesday evening by Quebec's Civil Safety for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
The northern rivers, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentides, and in the Chêne, in Lotbinière, were the subject of flood vigils and remained under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, the heavy rainfall has led to the overflow of certain lakes, Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was taken because of the heavy rains.
Ten residences had to be evacuated by preventive measure.
In Outaouais, the overflowing of some lakes led to the closure of several roads, especially in the municipality of Mansfield and Pontefract.
Civil security remains on alert and monitors the situation closely, said Annik Bouchard, a security adviser.
The Quebec Crues Forecast Centre has issued Wednesday warnings of strong crusts for several rivers, including Maskinongé, L'Assumption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and the Wolf.
Partly Blamed Doupon
Quebec radio broadcaster Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial reversal before the Canadian Radiotelevision Standards Council (CCNR) for controversial remarks on social assistance and Haitians as well as on his coarse on-wave language.
The CCNR considers that Mr. Dupont and his team of CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their views, but that some of the words contained "inaccurate information on social assistance, unduly negative representations of Haitians and rude language that did not suit broadcasts during the day".
The Commission also concluded that a discussion on suicide, including the dissemination of the name of two people who had committed suicide, did not violate the broadcasting codes.
The NCC had received several complaints about comments made during broadcasts between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made as a result of a complaint by Quebec's Joint Front of Social Assisted Persons.
The group complained that the amounts quoted in the issue were inaccurate.
The facilitators must present solid information rather than misleading information.
Regarding suicide, Stéphane Dupont considered suicide to be a cowardly gesture.
The majority of the members of the Committee concluded that the vehicular message was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life's problems.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes in question of "Dupont le noon" have addressed a sensitive subject in a fair and appropriate manner."
No blame has therefore been held in his place.
The last dispute was about statements that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had then turned to a media-face that had caused a lot of reactions.
CHOI's facilitator stated that he had not made any donations to help Haitians because we could not know with certainty that needy people would really receive the money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an unduly negative representation of Haitians.
"I've already purged my three-day suspension on this."
"My file has been a virgin for a year and a half," said the facilitator.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the dissemination of coarse language.
In each case, the CHOI-FM broadcaster collaborated "beyond its obligation".
The consequences are minimal for the station that will have to announce these decisions once during the hours of great listening within three days.
A Kung-fu king in Montreal
The Montrealans of Algerian origin Nacereddine Zemmal has an extremely special route.
The athlete who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and boxing Thai climbs on the world's tatamis and ringes in search of new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts like kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria, explained Zemmal, installed in the metropolis since 2008 to evolve among professionals."
"In my case, I'm looking for fights a little everywhere, since for those who don't like the ground game in mixed martial arts, competitions are rare in North America."
Recently, he who works as a security officer and committed for the UPS company has just released bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association's amateur World Championship (WKA) from October 23 to 30, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the categories of kickboxing full contact and Thai boxing, he explained."
"Now, I'm getting ready to go to China for the World Cup of San Shu."
"The fighters who finished among the first four at the last world championship in each category were invited."
"I won bronze in 2009 in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished eighth."
"In 2007, in China, I completed the fifth tournament, while I arrived third in Toronto in 2009, he added."
"What's interesting is that I've made progress at every competition."
"At this rate, I will be first this time or next year!"
"San Shu" or "sanda" is a discipline originating in China where punching and kicking, as well as ground projections, are allowed.
The duels are originally held on a platform and rarely in a ring.
The most famous boxer in this form of combat is the American of Vietnamese origin, Cung Le, well-known in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal has to hold only one event in his career, he will surely respond to his presence at the super tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of kung-fu.
"This competition is the highest and most prestigious competition in China," explained the sympathetic gaillard."
"It's a bit the equivalent of the Lumpinee Stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first match, half-final of his category (80 kg), before losing in the final.
"He who defeated me was a real pro, he analysed."
"There are four combatants per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semifinals face at the end of their category."
"Then the winners of each category face to crown one champion, the king of kung fu."
450 million in contracts without calls for tenders
Hydro-Québec has willingly awarded $450 million in contracts to engineering firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, it is a consortium formed by BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor companies that have obtained the most important, the management of the project, for an amount of $295 million without a call for tender.
This consortium called Energy Management was set up in 2004 in conjunction with Hydro-Québec's choice to entrust the private sector with its responsibility to manage this major hydroelectric project of $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium Energy gerance took over the lucrative contract without any public tenders.
For the Quebec Party, the use of corporate consortia poses a serious ethical problem that could eliminate competition and lead to higher prices.
"It's the new way to collusion and knock down competition."
"That is, people, instead of secretly doing this, are now doing it openly," said yesterday Pakistani MP Sylvain Simard at the press conference.
Earlier this morning, Mr. Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because he said he could hardly see how the public's interest could be served in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, replied in the afternoon, vigorously denying that there was collusion for this contract.
"I begin to have my journey," she fished, claiming that the PQ had been "sick" and had "no rigour."
She said that "it would be the least of the things" that the PQ apologizes.
Consortium formula is a common practice worldwide.
This is usually a time-limited alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their respective expertise to respond to a call for tenders for a complex project.
The Eastmain project has a high level of complexity in view of the extent of the work.
The project is under way and is scheduled to run until 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without competition; there was negotiation.
Also, the consortium formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As revealed last week's Le Devere, the Consortium Form in the Engineering and Counselling Sector is being investigated by the government.
A quick overview of the business register of Quebec enables the number of more than 200 consortia, some of which seem permanent.
Thus, Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, including CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin and other Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, brings back to one and the same moral person, Dessau.
With regard to the consortium Energy gerance, Minister Normandeau noted that "the James Bay territory has responded to particular labour dynamics and that Hydro-Québec has been responding in a special way since the 1970s."
The great patron of the Eastmain project, Real Laporte, of the James Bay Energy Corporation (SEBJ), gave an explanation that highlighted the fact that the project's management contract was granted willingly.
"If you're calling for tenders and there are few bidders, your prices will be higher."
"You have two choices: whether you take the people who are in this market and say: we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement with a good price."
"But the idea is that it's not the price that's important, it's people's competence," said Mr. Laporte.
This contract awarded to the consortium Energy gerance is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devere counted 109 engineering-consultation contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to firms or their subsidiaries, including soil laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin cooled 22 contracts, Genivar won 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, not including its participation in Energy gerance.
All contracts were negotiated.
They total $449,783,344, including the $295,131,564 management contract.
Sylvain Simard suggested that the four firms that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "well known to the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau made it clear that the PQ was also linked to these firms that "financed it", before clarifying that it was his leaders.
Responsible consumption barometer - The "green" label does not inspire trust
Greener, but frankly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has very little confidence in sustainable development actors, but also in fair trade marks and eco-certifications to guide his choices.
Pis, even if he bathes in a media universe where messages for more responsible consumption are pumping, he deplores a lack of credible information, lacks even qualifying to brake on his commitment, indicates the responsible consumption barometer, whose first reading was delivered yesterday.
Even though they have increased consumption of socially responsible products in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those trying to sell them.
Two thirds of them say they do not believe the environmental commitment of companies as well as the green advertising of companies, reveals the measuring tool developed by the Sherbrooke University Responsible Consumer Observatory.
Another finding is that half of consumers doubt the reliability of official certifications on such products, but also the credibility of the products and trade marks that are co-responsible, says the Barometer.
In the same vein, the speech of politicians on this subject is taken seriously by only 14.6% of Quebecers.
Information on responsible consumption, however, appears to be essential to stimulate this currently animated consumption rate by almost one third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, the vacuum and the questionable nature of the information would calm the burns of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the Barometer, after the highest price of these products.
In addition, one third of Quebecers also claim to be suspicious of the alleged performance of green products or services that they seek to put into their hands.
On another note, consumers were almost half in 2010 to have changed their habits and, above all, changed the brand of one or more products to meet their convictions.
At 61%, they also promoted purchases from local merchants and preferred the purchase of food products grown in their area, says the Barometer.
More green and responsible - the index of responsible consumption has reached 64 over a maximum of 100 for this year - Quebec's Homo consumus likes to appear as the king of recycling who seeks to reduce its environmental footprint by caring about animal protection.
However, his social and ecological awareness seems to remain outside his car, says the Barometer: in 2010, only 28% of Quebecers indicated that they had used public transportation or called for co-vehicles to defend their green interests.
The walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of participants in this extensive behavioral survey, which has just taken its first click.
A State loan for the purchase of eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, to whom it was asked to make a financial commitment to the purchase of the eXcentris film complex by the Angus Society and the Parallel, agrees to collaborate, but only with a loan.
The Angus Development Society and the Parallel, which were expecting a $7 million gift from the Ministry of Culture to buy Daniel Langlois from the eXcentris film complex on the Saint-Laurent boulevard by giving him his full cynephilic vocation, do not get what they claimed.
The government agrees to be involved in the file, but under its own conditions.
Rather than the anticipated donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan that would be lower than initial expectations, which could be a viable solution to advantageous conditions, at least in the opinion of sources from state offices.
A first action plan and a request of 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but the requests have since been revised downwards.
A proposal and action plan were sent to Minister St-Pierre by the President of the Cultural Enterprise Development Society (SODEC), François Macerola, who pilots the eXcentris dossier.
He sent him a final report about ten days ago.
But the firm's counter-proposition reached SODEC on Tuesday.
The Parallel and Angus have until December 31st to answer.
It seems, however, that the assumption of the State's gift must be effectively ruled out.
It should be recalled that the Association des owners de cinéparcs de cinéparcs du Québec opposed direct investment by the State in support of the acquisition of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture does not have to finance real estate projects, which it has not done for other cinemas.
On the contrary, many stakeholders claimed substantial economic assistance.
Daniel Langlois, the master of the cyans, has for ten years carried the cinema of author in his premises of the complex after having financed his own construction, which could justify a derogation from the Treasury Board.
The lack of rooms for independent films is screaming in Montreal, and eXcentris had his client loyalty.
The Angus Society and the Parallel, with their head Christian Yaccarini, are piloting a private funding campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to push on the wheel of the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one of the three screens, Le Parallelle, has continued to broadcast eXcentris films.
The goal of future buyers is to reopen the three halls next February 27 by designing the beautiful film of Xavier Beauvois Men and gods.
But Christian Yaccarini did not remember Le Devere and we do not know what he and his group think of downward proposals that have been made to them.
The veil raised on a complex Canada...
The new U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks are veiled about what the U.S. considers to be the inferiority complex of Canadians to the Americans, but at the same time they betray the feeling of superiority of Canadians to Canada.
For example, American diplomats are surprised that every Canadian elector does not have Canadian-American relations in mind by going to vote and believe that President Obama's visit helped the Conservative government adopt its budget in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, held in the public square yesterday, offer more cross-cutting details than substantial content to put under your teeth.
A cable dated September 22, 2008, or in the middle of a federal electoral campaign, relates to the extent to which the United States is not one of the issues discussed by political leaders.
To the great surprise of the American ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins offers some explanations for this situation.
"An almost inherent Canadian inferiority complex may require Canadian political leaders to speak of internal issues of daily life rather than to have this election on the United States (as in the 1988 Free Trade Campaign)" he writes.
The United States is therefore, he concludes, "the elective proverbial of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to speak of it."
The ambassador understands, at least, this "breathing silence" that both countries have an intense political and economic relationship.
" logically, he believes, the ability of a candidate, a party and even more of a party leader to manage this essential relationship should be a key factor that voters have in mind by going to vote."
The other expression of this important feeling is read in the cable sent on January 22, 2009, by Terry Breese, in charge of business in Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help ensure the survival of the government in the confidence vote in early February on the federal budget, by which Canada will display its first deficit in more than a decade due to a recovery plan of $30 to $40 billion," writes Dr. Breese.
No mention is made of the fact that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas to avoid being overthrown by the coalition and that opposition parties made its survival conditional on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, warns Washington of the increasingly negative image that the drama series broadcast at CBC refer to the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about Border, Little Moscow on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O emissions, in which there are few subtle references to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or the CIA's removals for muscular interrogations.
Another cable reports that during their first bilateral meeting Hillary Clinton asked his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to welcome some Guantánamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner answered yes, but on the basis of the case-by-case.
At the end of the meeting, he wrote, "he gave a paper to the Secretary of State about Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The secretary agreed to review the file."
Finally, we note that spirits are warming up on the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, a very close former advisor to Stephen Harper, said on CBC's waves that the person responsible for this massive flight should be "killed".
He echoed Mike Huckabee in the United States.
A Global Plan to Renew Lighting
Yesterday, the United Nations proposed to Cancún a plan for domestic, commercial and industrial lighting renovation in 100 countries to obtain a greenhouse gas reduction (GES) that corresponds to almost one-third of the additional reduction needed to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan lies in the wake of the major concrete projects that the United Nations hopes to adopt in Cancún to compensate for the absence of binding commitments to reduce industrialized countries.
According to the plan tabled yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs that still monopolize from 50 to 70% of the market were replaced by fluocompact bulbs or, better, by electroluminescent diode bulbs (DEL or "LED" in English), the bulk of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of GHGs emitted on the planet to enlighten humans would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions from the global car park.
In Copenhagen last year, major issuing countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, have engaged in voluntary reduction plans that are expected to shift global GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will be necessary to subtract this balance sheet from another 5 Gt to stabilize by 2020 the climate increase to 2 degrees centigrade to prevent it becoming out of control.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy dissipates in the form of heat and the rest, or 5%, produces light.
With fluocompact bulbs, energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, this need for energy is reduced twice again.
Fluocompact bulbs last on average from 6000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those launched by the manufacturer Philips this week - this company has also participated in the United Nations study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consumes 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, giving an idea of the possible economy with a replacement plan that would apply to 100 countries.
These new bulbs can also work with rheostats in addition to emit very little heat.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several specialists have posted reservations to fluocompact bulbs, since they contain mercury and have to be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers put in place instructions.
But, according to the report, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the fluocompact bulb, but rather the thermal coal plants, which emit a lot of mercury to produce waste electricity in in incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report details the gains that each country would make through this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save one billion dollars a year in electricity purchases and eight million tons of CO2, equivalent to 3.5 thermal power plants with a construction cost of 2.5 billion.
Côte d'Ivoire Expects the Announcement of Electoral Results in Nervousness
The Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, called for the "untimely" publication of the results of the presidential election in Côte d'Ivoire, after the expiry of the deadlines.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and to announce the interim results without further delay," said a spokesperson for the UN Chief."
"It calls on all Ivorian parties and institutions to exercise responsibility and to refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite the pressure exerted by some foreign governments, the election commission left the deadline of Wednesday, midnight without publishing the results, three days after the Sunday poll.
About forty minutes before the expiry of the deadline, the President of the CIS stated on television that the commission "continues to work" to announce the results.
The calls multiplied on Wednesday in the world so that the CIS finally proclaims the name of the winner of the second round between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and the opponent Alassane Ouattara.
But the Gbagbo camp is counting on the cancellation by the Constitutional Council of "fraudulous" votes in the north, held by the ex-rebellion of the Forces nouvelles (FN) since the failed coup d'état of September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, campaign director of the Ivorian president, said that the intimidation of the voters practiced by the FNs in the north of the country had deterred the supporters of the outgoing president from voting.
The whole election could be cancelled if the complaints filed by Gbagbo are accepted by the Constitutional Council.
But Gbagbo's opponents believe that the highest court in the country is not neutral because it is led by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a northern man who denies any connection with the former rebels, has deemed "unacceptable" the delay in the announcement of the results and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but he did not go until he claimed victory.
His allies claim that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows that he has lost and has filed a complaint with the Constitutional Council, after preventing the electoral commission from disseminating the results, it would be illegal.
The Presidential's second round, Sunday, was supposed to crown the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country that had been split up in two years.
The United Nations warned on Wednesday the Ivorian political class that it could be held responsible for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had completed the first round on October 31, with 38% of the votes against 32% in Alassane Ouattara, who received public support from former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% on the first round).
The unemployment rate remained stable in France in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France within the meaning of the International Labour Office (ITB) remained stable at 9.3% in Metropolis (9.7% with overseas departments), showing the adjusted data of the provisional seasonal changes (SICs) published on Thursday by Insee.
The number of unemployed is 2,631 million in metropolis.
Data from the second quarter were confirmed to 9.3% of the active population in metropolis and 9.7% with the DOMs.
Over a year, the unemployment rate is rising by 0.1 points.
More broadly, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter but wanted to work, whether or not they were available in the two weeks to work and whether or not they were looking for a job.
The situation of young people in the labour market has still deteriorated, with a further increase in the unemployment rate, increased to 24.2% in metropolis (+ 0.9 points over three months, +0.5 points over one year) and 25% including the DOMs.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged 15-24 were unemployed within the meaning of the ILO.
The seniors experienced a slight increase in unemployment, at 6.4% in metropolis (+0.2 points over three months and over one year), i.e. 482,000 people aged 50 or older, and 6.6% with the DOMs.
Only 25-49 years have benefited from unemployment stability in the third quarter, at 8.3% in metropolis (-0.1 over three months, +0.1 over one year) and 8.8% throughout France.
Insee no longer publishes monthly unemployment rates since 2006, after a controversy over its method of calculation.
Eurostat, the European Union statistics agency, continued to do so and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (DOM included) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guerini under review and in custody
Alexandre Guerini, 53, head of waste processing companies and brother of the PS President of the General Council of Bouches-du-Rhône, was examined and crashed at the arrest house of Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence as part of an investigation into alleged fraudulent public procurement.
Alexandre Guerini has been examined for abuse of social property, diversion of funds and public property, reception, active corruption, trafficking in influence and detention of ammunition, says his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guerini is combative and tends to explain all the questions the magistrate is going to ask him, not ghosts."
"It's easy to prosecute him for a multitude of reprehensible leaders, it's something else to prove them," AFP told AFP his lawyer, Florence Renault, before his client's hearing.
Mr. Guerini, brother of the strong PS man in the department, Jean-Noël Guerini, has, through his lawyers, been obliged to send a memo to the judge before his hearing.
One of his close friends, Philippe Rapezzi, was also examined on Wednesday night and failed.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, his client has never done anything other than operating the landfills he had to manage.
As for the allocation of markets or the destination of funds related to their operation, he never knew about it, said Me Simon.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former director general of the services of the agglomeration of Aubagne, was examined on Wednesday for diversion of public funds and complicity, and left free under judicial control with prohibition of meeting the protagonists of the file.
"My client has been able to provide explanations to the facts against him."
"The magistrate took account of this by not depriving him of his liberty," said his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
Four other persons had been examined and released on Tuesday night, on Wednesday, with placement under judicial control for two of them, said the Deputy Prosecutor of the Republic Michel Rafin.
Michel Karabadhakian, Deputy Director General for the Cleanliness of Marseille Provence Metropole (MPM), is being pursued for "traffic of influence and passive corruption".
Two officials from the agglomeration of Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Brindisier are examined for "a person in charge of a public service mission to remove and detour public property", the other for "complicity of diversion of public funds".
Finally, the companion of Alexandre Guerini, Jeannie Peretti, was examined for "recel of abuse of social property".
Among the people who have been confronted with Mr. Guerini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who has recently been involved in a parallel case of fraudulent public procurement in Corsica.
The investigators suspect their companies of serving to bake money from the big banditry.
The investigation is carried out in the context of several judicial information opened against X in April 2009 following anonymous mails, for alleged fraud in the procurement of public procurement, in particular in the waste sector.
From a close source to the investigation, investigations focus on the conditions for the allocation and operation of a landfill of La Ciotat, which collects the waste of Aubagne as well as certain cities of the urban community of Marseilles (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss case: the Elysée exaggerated the mediation of Syria
For more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for "spionage", held the opinion in haleine in France, put diplomacy on the alert, and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
Everything under the eye of diplomats in the United States.
The US documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some below this crisis.
They describe how Elysée explained his strategy to the Americans, even giving them advice to deal with their own hostage crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the French officials sought to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman had not taken for granted the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian inmate in France and sought by American justice for trafficking in materials for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they put in raw light the way the French Presidency sought to manipulate the media to believe that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad had played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
Actually, it was nothing.
A diplomatic telegram written on August 12, 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to manage hostage cases".
The Councillor of the Elysée for Strategic Affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, met with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method to him.
They advise the Americans to do the same in order to repatriate their own citizens deprived of strength in Iran.
"Make noise", they say, "martelete unceasingly" in the media the words "rights of fundamental man", "innocence", "instant liberation".
It is necessary in order to embarrass the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
"Make it all the more so that the Iranians ask you not to do so."
Because, past the attempts of discussions by discreet channels, "silence will not solve anything", Iranians are "masters in dilateral maneuvers".
Mr. Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is "a familiar Iranian tactic: the taking of hostages for political blackmail".
He announced that the release of Clotilde Reiss prison (which will take place on August 16, the day she took refuge in the Embassy of France) "will require the Iranians to pay a large amount of money" (230,000 euros of bail).
And he tells us that the Elysée anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that "will get worse."
Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of some 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he says.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has been released from prison for 12 days, but remains locked in Iran.
Information is disseminated: Iran's Majid Kakavand, whose United States demands extradition for illegal traffic in sensitive electronic equipment to Iran, is released in Paris, on the decision of a judge.
The American Embassy, like many observers, is questioning this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which is blocking Iranian clandestine networks for the acquisition of equipment for the nuclear programme, Majid Khakavand's enlargement is bad news.
Did France accept a trade?
The release of Iran against that of the French?
During a new interview with Kathleen Allegrone, on September 4, François Richier made sure that is not the case.
The Elysée, he said, did not only "be completely taken by surprise by the judge's decision", but sought to oppose it.
"There has been lively exchanges between the French Presidency and the guard of the seals" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot return to the judicial decision", he observes.
Mr. Richier also wanted to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remained under the "close" supervision of French intelligence services.
Elysée's advisor composed a telephone number, hangs up, and then informs the American diplomat that Iran "is currently located in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian Embassy".
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, Elysée does not spare its efforts, through media releases and "flights", to make it believe that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays a "important" and "influent" role as a "mediator".
The Americans observe this activity not without irony, and note that manipulation bears fruit as several press articles affect the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 refers to "the 'blitz' media of French officials".
On what is based so much "gratitude" expressed to Mr Assad, the embassy in Paris is asked.
"Despite their statements full of praise, French officials in private acknowledge that they have only a vague notion of what the Syrians really did."
The document then discusses the reasons why the Elysée had to pay in this fiction.
The intensive communication effort "to validate Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria", he analysed.
A policy launched in 2008, which "was then perceived, by many critical voices in France and abroad, as premature and immerited".
By "exacting the Syrian role", Paris seeks to "show Syria what praises it can attract by playing a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also to "seed seeds of discord between Syria and Iran".
The U.S. Embassy knows it as a good source.
On August 11, François Richier told him: "Of course, we don't know if the Syrians did anything."
"But we thanked them anyway."
"This should at least cause confusion among Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy received it to Elysée.
In a communiqué, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal, and Syria for their "active role in the liberation of our countryman".
No online games for young Koreans past midnight
The South Korean government will adopt a law called "Cendrillon" that will prevent teenagers from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials indicated.
A bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to request online gaming companies to block access to these games after midnight, to young people under 16 years of age, indicated representatives of ministries of culture and family.
"Many children play these games all night and then have difficulty studying at school and having a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and the right to sleep," said AFP Jo Rin, the ministerial officer in charge of the bill.
Online games will be accessible again at 6 a.m.
Companies will have one year to prepare for law enforcement, he said.
The government is also planning to ask companies to limit the daily access time to these games for young people who are being asked by their parents, he added.
It will also make available people who demand free software to limit time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report various facts related to intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion of global online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea had won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, compared with 58 other nations.
2018-2022 World: Fifa designates the organizing countries
In turmoil due to suspicions of corruption, the Executive Committee of Fifa designates Thursday the organizing countries of the World Cups 2018 and 2022, a eminently political choice where influence struggles and lobbying are likely to take action on technical criteria.
One thing is certain, the 2018 edition of the Fifa Queen Competition will take place in Europe, traditional bastion of discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 will be much more exotic, the International Federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a first on the African continent in 2010, or to continue its establishment in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities included in the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch Heads of Government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) is measuring the economic and political issues of a World.
So back treatments may last until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy among candidates.
According to Fifa's evaluation report, English, Hispano-Portuguese (2018) and US (2022) files have better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not weigh heavily on the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, which resulted in the suspension of two EC members of corruption (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have ruined the chances of his country, the birthplace of football that only hosted the World once, in 1966.
The BBC gave it a layer, Monday, by broadcasting a documentary that pins three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
What is the problem with Fifa and embarrassing English officials, who have been in an intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron on the front line.
The head of the government hopes to re-edit the success of his predecessor Tony Blair, who had obtained in 2005 from London the organization of the JO-2012.
Will this intense activity be sufficient to invoke the curse of England with the EC?
Nothing is less certain because the duo Spain-Portugal has no shortage of assets with its already ready stages, its expertise (Mondial-82 in Spain, JO-92 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the dark economic and financial prospects of both countries could soften their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only increase Russia's share, becoming an outsider of weight despite the shortcomings in its file (stations, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided not to make the move to Zurich and has denounced a "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote", in a mere veiled allusion to the accusations of the English press against the members of the EC.
"On mud cover, we try to compromise them," Mr. Putin said.
For 2022, the United States, strong in the 1994 experience, appears as the logical favours.
The first world economic power, the seat of the main sponsors of Fifa, seems to have a long lead on Japan and South Korea, which have built a very beautiful project separately.
But these new applications appear pre-matured for two countries that co-organized the test in 2002.
Another threat: the granting of the 2026 World Cup to China, desperately desired by Fifa, which would in fact bring down Asian chances by 2022.
With Qatar, which released the big game by proposing futuristic stages, and Australia, Fifa would continue to expand to new districts, but these two countries present more risks than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also suffer from weak TV rights paid (because of the time gap) by European countries, the war nerve for Fifa.
Second mandate: evidence
De Gaulle was really upset.
Mitterrand had made him appear to hesitate.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not have the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than they do.
One warrant to the Elysée calls it another.
So the current head of state will be candidate in 2012.
But the evidence does not do good housekeeping with the mystery part attached to the presidential function.
So we have to make it as if the doubt still existed.
In one sense as in the other.
In 2006, even without believing it, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that a third term was not excluded.
On November 15, Nicolas Sarkozy made sure that he would make his decision "somewhere in the fall of 2011".
Let him speak in front of UMP parliamentarians on Tuesday evening at Elysée, the prospect of "two mandates" has therefore sown a little fever.
Was that the official announcement of his candidacy?
We were far away.
The President only recalled that the constitutional revision of 2008 limited the number of five-year-olds to two.
He made a statement, not an announcement.
This is not the first time that he mentioned the Presidential, on the tone of humour, at such meetings.
"To the worst, or at best, you still have seven and a half years with me," he launched them in July 2009.
Rebel in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not thinking about the next step."
His earlier remarks make him no more candidate than the previous one; they make him no less.
If they make comments, that's for a double reason.
The acceleration of the PS application race, on the one hand.
But it's not Segolène Royal's entrance into law that drives Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, its candidacy in 2012 is evident that many of the PS demand an earlier battle order than planned.
Bad polls, on the other hand.
For the first time, voters on the right would prefer the candidacy of François Fillon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion at the PMU on this," he immediately and cautiously responded to the Prime Minister's entourage.
"If he believes the defeat is possible, he will not be candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe he can win," corrects Alain Juppé, resigned to the obvious.
Euro: The ECB is obliged to maintain its procurement of state securities
The last meeting of the Council of Governors of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year was to be an opportunity to clarify the modalities for exiting the crisis or, at least, to announce the termination of many of the non-conventional monetary policy operations to be completed at the end of the year.
The European sovereign debt crisis requires that the Frankfurt Emissions Institute may not afford to be as peremptory as it is to aggravate today's situation in the European bond markets.
The political cost would be even higher.
Yesterday, at a press conference, the French Minister of Finance, Christine Lagarde, welcomed the ECB's active role in resolving the debt crisis in Europe.
It did not wish to say whether it felt that the central bank should do more, for example by increasing its sovereign bond purchase programme.
"I reserve my thoughts to my European partners (...) ".
The day before, in Brussels, at its hearing by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not show any more dissident about his intentions, merely indicating that the programme for the purchase of State securities on the secondary market "continued" and that "we will see what we will decide" at the meeting on Thursday.
Only certainty: the ECB will keep its main interest rate unchanged at 1%, its lowest historical level since May 2009.
In fact, purchases of Treasury bonds by the ECB doubled last week to nearly €1.35 billion.
And, according to the indiscretions of market operators, it would have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese titles yesterday.
In total, the central banks of the Eurosystem have purchased 67 billion euros since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt that the anticipation of further procurement (see page 29).
Nor do economists expect remarkable change of mind.
If lending operations at more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the ECB still proceeds to unlimited liquidity allocations under generous conditions and for periods ranging from one week to three months.
Economists today expect this device to be extended for a few months.
"I can't imagine she changes her program significantly."
"Otherwise, it would take the risk of new tensions in the short term," said Michael Schubert, economist of the Commerzbank.
"A progressive release announced in the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely", anticipates Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In terms of its interventions in the public debt market, "the ECB should maintain a purchase volume of these obligations in order to stimulate an atone market," says Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of European banks' exposures to euro area sovereign debt markets, the issuing institution has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It is necessary at all costs to replace the lack of investors in the market and to act in such a way as to prevent a package of returns paid by the most fragile states," said an important mandatory manager yesterday.
For if interest rates fly away, States will all the more be embarrassed to reduce their debt, otherwise stabilise it.
The safeguard of the euro is at this price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government makes the back round
After a disturbing beginning of the week for Italy, the situation was somewhat relaxed yesterday, with the decline in compulsory rates at 10 years.
A return to precarious calm.
On leaving a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional presidents said they heard Giulio Tremonti call the "indecipherable" situation and expect a "unforeseen" weekend, which the interested party later denied.
On Tuesday, however, the gap with the German long rates had reached the record of 210 basis points and the price of cover contracts against the risk of bankruptcy (CDS) had circled at 263 points, leading to a certain inflation in Rome.
At the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain, the gap with German rates was more than 400 basis points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, was "strongly concerned" by "market turbulence" and a possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly, its problem is the absence of growth and the atony of the tax returns that go with, making the state run the risk of no longer being able to cover its funding needs.
The latest Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
Italy's growth is now expected at 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the current budget for consideration in the Senate is 1.3% and 2%, respectively.
Under these conditions, the European Commission calculates that the public deficit will still represent 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to 3.9% by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumor of a new budget group that could be put in place after the holidays, for a sum of €7 billion.
"If necessary, new austerity measures will have to be taken," said Economic Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn.
For the time being, Italy receives support from international institutions.
"The fundamentals of its economy are in order and its accounts are good, we have been repeating it for a long time," says Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund in charge of Italy at the IMF.
"There is no problem in the immediate, short-term or long-term, because despite its significant debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts requested in Italy are less than those requested in other countries," observes Pier Carlo Padaan, OECD chief economist.
The question of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the Chamber of Deputies, after which early elections could be held at the end of March.
There would then be a period that would not be conducive to decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about strengthening anti-crisis mechanisms
Christine Lagarde still hammered her yesterday at a press conference in Paris: "The Europeans, I believe that it was still demonstrated on Sunday and at night, are obviously supportive, determined, committed to defending their currency and their monetary area."
Although all relative, the detachment recorded yesterday on the rates of European State bonds brought water to the mill of governments and the ECB.
But we still cannot talk about a beginning of standardization.
The Standard & Poor's rating agency has announced that it could degrade the debt rating of Portugal, the most targeted target today by speculation.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, which is particularly concerned with banking systems," said economists at Exane BNP Paribas.
More and more, "political time is much slower than market time".
Aware of this hiatus and the dangers it poses, European countries are intensifying discussions to strengthen existing anti-crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultations between the most directly concerned finance ministers and, more broadly, with their G20 peers are going well.
And this is also for Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings from the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the menu, the fate of non-conventional measures to support euro area countries in the collimator of markets (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, began a tour of Asia in Singapore on Tuesday to inform extreme-eastern investors of the crisis developments in Europe.
If the objective of these visits is not to raise funds, it certainly prepares the field.
The first programming of FESF titles is scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, a U.S. official representative told Reuters that the United States would support a possible increase in funds mobilized by an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
The countries on the front line, Portugal and Spain, are ready to adopt structural reforms, particularly with regard to the organisation of the labour market.
Reforms that are in addition to closer austerity measures.
Lisbon and Madrid want to take a different path from that of Greece and Ireland.
Both have at all costs to avoid seeking international assistance before setting up their own budgetary corrections and to decide on structural reforms that are necessary to restore lasting confidence.
Finally, European donors discuss options to accelerate the process of standardising sovereign bonds markets.
On 24 November, Axel Weber put forward the first idea that if the EUR 750 billion mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not sufficient, the Union would not hesitate to hand over the portfolio.
The economists of Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European sovereign debt market, believe that a rally of about EUR 100 billion would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of direct injection of liquidity.
The vehicle exists: it is the European Financial Stabilization Mechanism with EUR 60 billion to date.
A council which is likely to be carefully examined in European capitals.
Especially if the market conditions were getting worse.
Neige et verglas: 24 departments on orange surveillance
Snow events still create problems of circulation, particularly on the secondary network in Britain, and may disrupt certain economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now on orange watch because of the risk of snow and ice.
The Eure, the Eure-et-Loir, the Deux-Sèvres and Vienna, have joined the 20 departments already on orange watch, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, later in the night.
According to Weather France, sustained snow floods affect the north of the Gironde and the Charentes and it snows weakly on the Ile-de-France.
Snow layers ranging from 2 to 5 cm, occasionally from 7 to 10 cm, are expected for the departments concerned, and from 1 to 3 cm, or up to 5 cm for the Parisian region.
The departments concerned are those of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the regions Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
Snow episodes are sufficiently remarkable to create traffic difficulties and disrupt certain economic activities, says Weather France.
In the Côtes d'Armor, several departments were prohibited from weighing more than 7.5 tons, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes.
The traffic on the secondary network in Britain is very difficult according to the gendarmes who recommend taking their vehicle only if necessary and the circulation of certain TER cars has been suspended for the day.
School transportation was banned for Thursday in Picardy.
No specific measures were envisaged on Wednesday night to restrict the circulation of heavy loads.
The prefecture "invites all motorists to the utmost prudence on the roads and to adapt their conduct accordingly".
The Civil Aviation Branch (DGAC) asked airlines to cancel Thursday 25% of their flights to Roissy Paris airport and 10% to Orly due to the coming snowfalls.
The DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their company.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport in southern London and Edinburgh Airport in Scotland are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial skis
Since the debate about the modernisation of transport in Ile-de-France has been full, billions have been raining.
In the discussion at least.
In particular, it refers to 23 billion for the Grand Paris Metro to build the Société du Grand Paris.
To start this GSP, the state announced a capital allocation of €4 billion.
In the theoretical scheme, it is this amount that will then allow the GSP to borrow on the markets part of the financing of its double loop.
Today, we finally get to the first additions.
The Correctional Finance Act 2010, which was considered in the Finance Committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains the arrangements for finding the beginning of the money.
They are two: the creation of a special equipment tax and an increase in office tax in Ile-de-France.
The first, read in the text of the bill, article 15, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
It is said to be: "The product of this tax is EUR 117 million per year".
The second is a reorganization of an office tax that already exists "in order to modernize it, to increase its product and to allocate this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that make?
Mystery.
It's not encrypted in the text.
We're a long way from the $4 billion.
"It is specified that these tax resources are added to the €4 billion of the capital allocation that will be mobilized by the State and brought to the Société du Grand Paris as far as the project is concerned", we can read in the statement of reasons.
At the GSP, we can't find this shocking system.
"From the time when revenue is created (the two taxes, ndlr), studies over three years can be covered and then tap into the 4 billion later, it explains."
"This will be recorded in the budget and drawn as appropriate."
The GSP estimates that the 4 billion will begin to be registered in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This mechanism, in which the 4 billion promised are still absent subscribers, is likely to provoke a somewhat agitated parliamentary debate.
First public meeting on 7 December.
Revenge hackers and diligent spies
The WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On the one hand, it turns out to be an apparent scandal, a scandal that only appears as scandal in front of hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at the international level, and predicts a future dominated by the regression.
But let's proceed in order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation that each file consisting of a secret service (of any nation) is composed exclusively of press cuts.
The "extraordinary" American revelations on Berlusconi's sexual habits only report what for months could be read in any newspaper (except those whose Berlusconi owns), and the caricature sinistering profile of Khadafi has long been for artists of cabaret subject to sketch.
The rule that secret records should only be composed of new ones already known is essential to the dynamics of secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go to a bookstore dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each work repeats (on the Graal, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templiers or the Rose-Croix) exactly what was already written in the previous works.
And not only because the author of occult texts does not like to do unpublished research (he doesn't know where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who are interested in occultism believe only what they already know, and who reconfirms what they have already learned.
That's the mechanism of Dan Brown's success.
Same for secret files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited in mind) the head of the secret services (or he may be, as I know, editor at Libération), who hold as true only what he recognizes.
The top secret information about Berlusconi that the American Embassy of Rome sent to the State Department was the same as Newsweek's published the week before.
So why did the revelations on these files make such noise?
On the one hand, they say what every cultured person already knows, namely that the embassies, at least since the end of World War II, and since the Heads of State could call or take an airplane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few little performances, have turned into espionage centres.
Any viewer of investigative films knows this very well, and it is only by hypocrisy that one pretends to ignore it.
However, repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy, and serves to place American diplomacy in a bad light.
Secondly, the idea that a hacker who can capture the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world will bring a significant blow to the prestige of the state department.
So the scandal does not put the victims as much as the "bourreaux" in such a crisis.
But let's come to the deep nature of what happened.
So, in Orwell's time, we could conceive of all power as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
The Orwellian prophecy had been completely proven since, being able to control every movement through the telephone, every transaction carried out, the hotel visited, the motorway borrowed and so on, the citizen became the total victim of the power eye.
But when we demonstrate, as it happens now, that even crypts of power secrets cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control report ceases to be one-way and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as a citizen's avenger - can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that no longer has the ability to keep its own secrets hold?
It is true, Georg Simmel already said, that a real secret is an empty secret (and empty secret can never be revealed); it is true, too, that all knowing about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed an empty secret, because it belongs to the public domain; but revealing, as WikiLeaks did, that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets means to remove all power from him.
WikiLeaks did nothing wrong with Sarkozy or Merkel, but made it too big for Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this injury due to a very powerful power?
It is clear that in the future, States will no longer be able to put online any reserved information - this would be published on a poster attached to the corner of the street.
But it is equally clear that with the current technologies, it is futile to hope to be able to maintain confidential relations by telephone.
Nothing easier than to find out if and when a head of state moved by plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can private and reserved relationships be maintained in the future?
I know that, for the time being, my prediction is about science-fiction and is therefore Romanesque, but I am obliged to imagine government officials who discreetly move in due diligence to uncontrollable routes, being only bearers of messages learned by heart or, at the most, by hiding the few written information in the heel of a shoe.
The information will be kept in a single copy in closed drawers: at the bottom, the Watergate spying attempt has been less successful than WikiLeaks.
I've had the opportunity to write that technology is now moving into crabs, that is to say backtracks.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet restored a telegraph on wire (telephones).
Video cassettes (analogs) had enabled film researchers to explore a step by step, going forward and backwards and discover all the secrets of the assembly, while now the CDs (digitals) only allow to jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. by macroportions.
With the high-speed trains, we go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while flying, and the movements it includes, it takes three and a half hours.
It is therefore not extraordinary that the communication policy and techniques come back to horse cars.
One last comment.
In the past, the press was trying to understand what was happening in the secret of the embassies.
Now, it is the embassies who request confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France bidows its promises of financing
A year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to examine compliance with the promises of rapidly unblocked funding (such fast start or early funding) made by developed countries.
And the big French beads are revealed.
In the Copenhagen agreement, developed countries committed to providing $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has pledged EUR 7.2 billion over three years and France EUR 1.26 billion (i.e. EUR 420 million per year).
At the opening of COP16, the EU took the big game to persuade its partners of the reality of its commitment to fast start financing: report detailing the action of its Member States, press conference, large side event, distribution of brochures...
The transparency operation is valuable and appreciated at its fair value: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same with the same level of precision.
The EU announces its release in 2010 of €2.2 billion, which sets it on the right track to meet its commitment of €7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look in detail, things are more complicated.
This money must be, according to the Copenhagen agreement, "new and additional" to ensure that an additional effort is made without being to the detriment of official development assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission had proposed harmonisation, some Member States whose France blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the best reference.
For example, the European Commission considered 2009 as a reference: international funding is maintained, and it adds 150 million over three years for fast start financing.
Other countries have chosen similar references in terms of year or level of official development assistance.
On the other hand, France considers that the financing of "all new projects" of 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to expenditure in previous years or at the overall level of Official Development Assistance.
In concrete terms, the total amount of France's support to developing countries can remain stable (or even shrink), it claims to respect its commitment to "new and additional" funding...
Another crucial element, the distribution of donations and loans.
Again, there is no rule and everyone chooses its way of calculating.
Some, like France, consider that 1€ loaned equals 1€ given.
Of course, this is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for some investments that are profitable (often projects related to mitigation of emissions based on more efficient technologies), it is necessary to present a euro that will be recovered as equivalent to a euro that is given... Moreover, it should be counted on its commitments only the cost of the loan for the lending country (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has to make such a reasoning: it "respects" its commitment of EUR 420 million by making 91.5% of loans (EUR 389.8 million) and 8.5% of donations (EUR 36.1 million) - see EU document to check for yourself.
It is the only EU country to use the loan so massively.
Germany requires 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands and Slovakia (in others) meet their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union puts 1€ to meet its commitment, France only puts 10 cents and considers that the effort is comparable.
Nice pass-by tour!
In short, in its fast start financing, France has a double swindling: on the one hand, on the evolution of action over time and on the reality of financial effort.
By spending only EUR 36.1 million, it can make it believe that it spends 420 million "new and additional" in line with its promises.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (though it seems that Bercy has achieved arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would the other Member States continue to give if it is enough to lend?) and in the negotiations since the developing countries are not entirely dubious...
The chapter on early funding is only a small, relatively short-term question compared to all climate discussions.
But it could be an extra grain of sand in the huge machine that is the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that will not be the case.
In any event, it is essential to learn from this first year of early funding.
First, France could announce a change in its way of accounting for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of compliance with its commitments and equity with the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France could move forward discussions on long-term financing issues (other crucial chapter discussed at the moment): the question of "additionality" or the way in which loans are recorded will not be excluded.
France could change its position to become as progressive on these issues as it is on others.
The hope therefore rests on the new Minister of the Environment, Ms Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement about France's fast start and its vision of "additionality" and the use of loans would be to increase the level of international confidence needed to advance in the discussions.
Children's Pesticide Alert
A 10-year-old child ingests on a day 81 different chemicals, according to a study published this Wednesday of the Generations Futures Association (formerly Movement for Rights and Respect for Future Generations).
The association, which warns that its results "have no significant statistical value in relation to the small number of samples analysed, but are illustrative of the problem treated", bought between July and September foods usually consumed in four meals and a cash in one day by a child over ten years old, in the supermarkets of the Oise and Paris.
These typical meals, including official recommendations - five fresh fruits and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 litre of water per day - as well as friandies, were examined by laboratories seeking chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The assessment of the plate is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, 42 of which are classified as carcinogenic possible or probable and five carcinogenic substances, some as well as 37 substances that may act as endocrine disruptors (EP), according to studies by several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Even if, in almost all cases, the legal limits for each chemical taken individually are not exceeded, we see in our investigation that the reality of consumer exposure to potentially carcinogenic contaminants and/or PE is worrying," the association notes.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogenic residues and three proven as carcinogens some, as well as about twenty residues likely to disturb the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, intended as baits by the study, presents traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide which is banned in France.
Same thing for Kenya's green beans, included in lunch, on which the study detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, the chopped steak, tuna in the box, and even the bread baguette and chewing gum were truffled with pesticides and other chemicals.
In the tap water the analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
For dinner, the salmon steak was the richest with 34 chemical residues detected and even the examination of the plastic plate used to heat the microwave meal was not exempt.
The final risk for the consumer of this "contaminant cocktails" "is probably underestimated", according to the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV), for its part, proposed "face to the urgency of the situation" to establish a moratorium on the use of pesticides, in order to stop "increasing civilization diseases".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) reported that there were residues of 365 different pesticides identified in the fruits and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
