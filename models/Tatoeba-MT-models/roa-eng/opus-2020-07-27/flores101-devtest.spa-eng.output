In addition to confirming that at least some dinosaurs were plums, a theory already widespread, it also provides specific data that fossils usually do not offer, such as their color and its three-dimensional structure.
According to experts, this animal has a brown plumage in the upper area and a pale or carotenoid tone at the bottom.
The finding also allows for a better understanding of the evolution of bird feathers.
Since the plumage of the dinosaurs does not have a well-developed axis, called excavations, but does present other features of the feathers (strings and beards), the researchers concluded that it is likely that the excavation is the result of a later evolutionary development of these other characteristics.
The structure that presents the pen suggests that its function was not related to the flight, but used it to regulate the temperature or as an indicator of it. Researchers argue that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the analyzed sample presents features of the plumage of an adult and not of a chicken.
The experts' appreciation was that, even when it comes to the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample illustrates more the plumage of an adult than that of a chicken.

I do not know whether or not they have lost sight of it, but most of the products from Central America came to this country tax-free.
Even so, the countries of Central America taxed 80 per cent of the products we produce with tariffs. We treat you.
It seemed to me that it didn't make sense; it was definitely not fair.
All I'm telling people is that you treat us the same as we treat you.
A bill was passed by the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, who does not allow selling or renting violent video games to minors.
The bill provides that violent video games that are sold in the state of California should be labeled with a calcomania with the legend “18” and penalize their sale to minors with a fine of $1,000 for non-compliance.
The Director of the Attorney General's Office, Kier Starmer QC, made a statement this morning informing that Huhne and Pryce would be brought to trial.

Schneider witnessed through a virtual link from a U.S. Air Force base in his home country.
Carpanedo participated in two individual races of the championship apart from the competition of Wednesday.
The first was the slalom, in which he obtained a “No Ending the First Race”, as did 36 of the 116 participants in that race.
In his other race, the giant slalon, obtained the tenth place in the female group of seats with a combined execution time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes behind the first Austrian finalist, Claudia Loesh, and 1:09.02 minutes below the ninth finalist, Gyöngyi Dani, of Hungary.
Four riders in the category were not able to complete their careers and a total of 45 participants from the Slalom Gigante did not reach the classification in the race.

At first, he was transferred to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Then he was transferred to Addenbrooke Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in the Edinburgh County Court, accused of the murder of his son.
While she is in custody pending prosecution and trial, any statement by an eye witness may be questionable, as her image has been widely disseminated.
It is a common practice in other regions of the United Kingdom, but as Scottish justice works otherwise, the courts considered the publication of photographs to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University noted: "journalists seem to be walking dangerously when they publish photos or other information about suspects."
The Crown Office, in charge of the prosecutions, pointed out to journalists that no additional comments would be made until the prosecution was issued.
According to the information that was filed, the document will deal with the border conflict, which Palestine intends to resolve on the basis of the limits in force prior to the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics also addressed, as reported, include the future state of Jerusalem, which both nations consider sacred, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a constant military presence in the valley for ten years once the agreement is signed, while PA only accepts five.
During the supplementary pest control test, the bodyguards were required to monitor the shooters closely, as they were monitored and assessed their effectiveness.
In a union between NPWS and the Australian Sports Shooting Association (NSW) Inc., suitable volunteers were recruited within the Sports Shooting Association's hunting program.
Mick O'Flynn, who is temporarily in charge of the NPWS Park Conservation and Heritage Office, noted that comprehensive security and training training was provided to the four shooters chosen for the shooting operation.
Yesterday, Martelly swore a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members.
In four years, it is Martelly's fifth CEP.
Last month, a presidential commission advised that the previous CEP should resign, as part of a series of measures that seek to lead the country to new elections.
The commission was the way Martelly responded to the widespread demonstrations that began in October against the regime.
The demonstrations, sometimes violent, were triggered by the fact that no elections are taking place, in some cases since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of iPods have been reported with problems of functioning and excessive warming, which resulted in six fires and caused burns less than four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economics, Trade and Industry (METI) reported 27 accidents involving these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company classified as ‘non-serious’.
The ministry pronounced itself in relation to the delay in Apple's report, saying that it was something "really regrettable."
Mariana was shaken by a earthquake at 7:19 local time (21:19 GMT) on Friday.

Similarly, the Pacific Tsunamis Alert Centre reported the absence of tsunami indicators.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former police officer in that country took a bus and held captive tourists from Hong Kong.
Rolando Mendoza opened fire with his M16 against foreign visitors.
Several hostages have been rescued and so far it has been confirmed that at least six have died.
The six hostages, including children and elders, as well as Filipino photographers, were released early.
Later, the photographers took the place of an elderly woman because she needed to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was cremated.
Liggins followed the same path as his father and began studying medicine.
He was trained in obstetrics and entered to work for the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
Liggins began research on premature delivery in his spare time while working at the hospital.
His study showed that fetal lung maturation of the baby could be accelerated through the administration of a hormone.
Xinhua reported that on Wednesday, government investigators managed to retrieve flight recorders from the black box.
Luna's fellow fighters also paid tribute to him.
Tommy Dreamer said: "The moon was the first queen of the Extreme. She missed the night of the two moons, something unique, like her. A strong woman."
Dustin Gold in Polvo Runnels stated: "The moon was as rare as me; even more. I will love and miss her. I hope she is in a better place".
Since 2008, among the 1400 polled prior to the 2010 federal elections, there has been a growth of 8% of those who oppose Australia becoming a republic.
Julia Gillard, acting Prime Minister, held during the 2010 federal election campaign, which he believed that Australia should become a republic after the end of Queen Isabel II's term of office.
34% of respondents share this vision and want Isabel II to be the last queen in Australia.
At one end of the survey 29% of people who believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible; in the other, 31% who believe that it should never do so.
The Olympic winner of the gold medal was to swim in the free style of 100 meters and 200 meters, and in three reliefs at the Commonwealth Games, but his physical condition has been questioned as a result of his complaints.
Medicines for pain relief have not been taken, because their use in the Games is prohibited.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and a professor of computer science at the University of Central Misuri, discovered the largest prime number known.
Many people checked the finding through the use of various types of hardware and software and at the beginning of February and made known on Tuesday.
Maybe comets have served as a source of water for our planet, as well as organic matter, which has the ability to form proteins and sustain life.
The expectation of scientists is to understand how the planets, in particular ours, originate, as comets stared on Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, assumed as governor at the beginning of the year and last month signed a bill that allows people of equal sex to marry.
He described the rumors as "political talk and nonsense".
It is speculated that it will be presented to the presidential elections in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, would reduce the distances from the air routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel per year, as well as carbon emissions.
It employs satellite technology, in contrast to old ground radar technology, in order to enable air traffic controllers to detect aircraft more accurately and provide more accurate data to pilots.
No extra transport will be implemented and trains will not stop at Wembley. Parking for cars and the dissuasion will not be available.
Due to the concern generated by the possible lack of transport, it was considered the possibility that the game would be held in closed doors, without the fans of the team.
On Thursday, Science magazine released an investigation that reported on the appearance of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Experts from Princeton University, U.S.A., and Uppsala University, in Sweden, reported that the new species managed to evolve in just two generations, even though it was estimated that it would take much longer, due to the reproduction between an endemic Darwin pine, strong Geospiza, and a migratory cactus pine, conirotris Geospiza.
Gold can take all kinds of forms and be wrapped in tiny figures.
Not only can you hammer and roll into sheets, but it is also possible to stretch it to achieve a very thin wire that can twist and break.
It can become very thin and adhere to another metal. It is such a thinness that it can be achieved that it was used to decorate the illustrations made by hand in books called "lit manuscrites".
This is called pH of a chemical substance. You can develop a pH indicator using red collar juice.
The color of the cabbage juice will be changed depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) is the chemical.
The number of hydrogen ions (H in pH) present in the analyzed chemical determines the pH level.
The hydrogen atoms are formed by a proton and an electron. Therefore, an hydrogen ion is the result of disposing a proton of its electron.
Shake both dry dusts together and, after doing so, with hygienic and damp hands, squeeze them out to form a ball.
A reaction will occur between moisture in their hands and outer layers, which will feel strange to the touch and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets with discharge in almost all houses, those connected with a sophisticated sewage system.
In some homes in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece, vestiges of sewerage systems were found.
They also had toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, public bathrooms had toilets and some were shared by men and women.
When you communicate with someone who is thousands of miles away, a satellite is being used.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space through a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space, as the light from Earth's atmosphere distorts part of the light and view we have.
A giant rocket, more than 100 feet high, is required to carry a satellite or telescope to the outer space.
The wheel has modified the world in amazing ways. The most relevant thing it has done for us was to provide us with a much simpler and faster transport.
Thanks to her today we have many means of transport, such as rail or automobile, among so many others.
Below, there are more moderate-sized feline that feed on medium prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including independent domestic cats) that feed on small species that exist in much more quantity, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of his success is the concept of niche: each feline has a particular function, which prevents him from competing with others.
Lions are the most socialized feline, and their lives pass within large groups called herds.
The herds are made up of one to three adult males of the same family group, united with up to thirty females and their offspring.
Generally speaking, females are closely related, making them a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion herds have the same behavior as wolves or dogs, with whom they keep an amazing similarity (in contrast to other big cats) both in their behavior and in which they are highly lethal to their prey.
Athlete integral, the tiger has the ability to climb (but not too well), swim, give extensive jumps and jalar five times stronger than a robust person.
The tiger is of the same kind (Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These are the only four cats capable of issuing roars.
The tiger's is not a full sound roar like the lion's, but rather, as a prayer of words spoken to grunts and cries.
Ocelots enjoy feeding on small creatures. As far as possible, they will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all their prey will have a much smaller size than theirs.
Scientists believe that the ocelots trace and find animals to eat (presses) through the smell, smelling the soil where they have passed.
They have a very good night vision and in dark places and also travel very closely. Ocelotes hunt their prey mimetizing with their surroundings and then sway over them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) departs from the main one they come from (for example, if they move to a mountain chain or a river, or move to a new island so that they cannot easily go back) they will often find themselves in a different environment than they used to.
The new environment has different resources and competitors and therefore a new population will need different characteristics or adaptations than it had before to be a strong competitor.
There have been no changes in the original population, which still need the same adaptations as in the past.
As time passes, as the incipient population adapts to the new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that it will not be possible to catalogue them as of the same species.
This process receives the name of speciation, which simply means the development of new species, and is an inevitable consequence and a fundamental part of evolution.
Plants generate oxygen that people breathe and absorb carbon dioxide that they exhale (which they fire).
The food of the plants is generated with solar energy, thanks to photosynthesis. In addition, they offer us shade.
We built our houses from the plants and with them we also made clothes. Most of the foods we eat are plants. Without them, animals would not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the alpha predator of his time, therefore he feared nothing, except others of his own species.
His long jaws had over 70 sharp teeth as knives, in addition to another group in the palate, which translates to mean that whatever happened to him in front of him, he had no escape.
We don't have the security, but we might have had the viperine. Its diet included turtles, big fish, other mosaics and, even, it could have been a cannibal.
It also strikes any creature who entered the water: not even a dinosaur as huge as T. Rex was a threat to him.
While most of that food would be quite familiar to us, the Romans also ate certain unconventional items at banquets, such as wild boars, real turkeys, snails and even a type of rodent, the liron.
Another thing that made a difference was that humble people and women ate sitting in a chair, while the children enjoyed sharing banquets and taking sides while they ate.
It is not possible that the recipes of ancient Rome included food that arrived in Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
Verbigracia, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa and no ancient Romans ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a central temple considered their home.
People carried sacrifices for the gods and priests sought to satisfy the needs of those celebrating ceremonies and festivals.
The temples have an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary to which only priests could enter.
At times, special pyramidal towers, called zigurats, were built to make them part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for its deity.
In the middle of the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was of no greater importance.
The Hebrew families spent most of their time outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were just displays that gave to the street. The houses were built with stone.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests; therefore, the wood was extremely expensive.
Very few people lived in Greenland. According to the Nordic sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, during a trip to the west, he discovered the island and gave it its name.
Still, without prejudice to their discovery, the Eskimo tribes already inhabited the place for that time.
Although each country was ‘scandinative’, there were marked differences in relation to the people, monarchs, habits and history between Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the film Treasure National, you may think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true; although the reverse of the document contains something written, it is not a map of a treasure.
The Declaration of Independence has the words "Declaration of Original Independence of 4 July 1776" in its context. The text appears at the bottom of the document, face down.
Although it is unknown to certain who wrote it, it is known that it was barely made, the huge parchment document (measure 293⁄4 inches per 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up to be saved.
Therefore, it is likely that the annotation has been added just as a label.
Although the landings carried out during Day D, as well as the subsequent clashes, had achieved the liberation of northern France, the southern side still remained.
His government was in the hands of the French "Vichy", who were a group that, in 1940, had agreed peace with the Germans and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the so-called "Dragon Operation" was deployed, through which the Allies invaded the south of France.
In just two weeks, the U.S. and Free France forces had achieved the liberation of southern France and were still on their way to Germany.
A civilization can be defined as a specific culture of which a large group of people live and work together; that is, a society.
The term civilization derives from the Latin civilis, which means civil, and is both related to the word civil, of the same language, which means citizen, as with citizens, whose meaning is city or city state and which, in addition, determines somehow the size of society.
State cities are the precursors of nations. A culture of civilization carries a long generational transmission of knowledge, a lasting cultural legacy and a homogeneous propagation.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical traces, and cannot be recognized as such civilizations themselves.
During the War of the Revolution, the 13 states formed, in principle, a weak central government under the Articles of the Confederation, in which the Congress was its only component.
The Congress did not have the power to set taxes and, since it had a national executive or judicial power, it was the responsibility of the state authorities, who often did not cooperate to enforce all their laws.
Nor was it empowered to nullify tax or tariff laws between states.
The articles demanded the unanimous approval of all states to proceed with their amendment, and the states gave so little importance to the central government that their representatives were usually absent.
The Italian national football team, together with Germany's selected team, is the second most successful team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the most popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, waterpolo, fencing, rugby, cycling, jockey on ice, jockey on skates and racing d Formula 1.
Winter sports have more popularity in northern areas, with athletes participating in international tournaments and Olympic events.
In Japan there are about 7000 islands (the largest is Honshu), which makes it the seventh largest archipelago in the world.
Because of the conglomerate/group of islands it contains, it is usually referred to Japan as an 'archipelago', from a geographical point of view.
The story of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when the sailors of Europe who sailed the place recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, that is, beautiful island.
The establishment, in 1624, by the Netherlands Company of the East Indies, of a base in southwest Taiwanese, began a transformation into the Aboriginal method of grain production, with the use of Chinese labor to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
The army of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the northern and western coastal region of Taiwan in 1683 and declared it dependent province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after being defeated during the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government acceded to the Shimonoseki treaty, through which Taiwan's sovereignty is transferred to Japan, which maintains its control over the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three capital buildings: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and that of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings have been rebuilt at the end of the complex in order for tourists to visualize how they were originally fighting.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and work has continued.
To illustrate, the most common fixed image photo format at global level is 35 mm, which was the most used film size towards the end of the analog film era.
Today it continues to be produced, but most importantly, its dimensional relationship was transferred to the image sensor formats of the digital cameras.
In fact, the 35 mm format is somewhat confusing, as its measurements are 36 mm wide for 24 mm high.
It is therefore said that the dimensional ratio of this format (to divide by twelve in order to calculate the simplest integer ratio) is equivalent to 3:2.
Many typical formats (verbicia, the APS format group) are equal or very similar to this aspect ratio.
The rule of the thirds, which has been the object of constant ridicule and often ridiculed, is a simple pattern that generates dynamism at the same time that allows to give some order to the images.
Indicates that the most effective position where to place the central object is the intersection that forms between the horizontal and vertical lines that divide the image into third (see example).
During this phase of the history of Europe, the Catholic Church, which had accumulated wealth and power, was questioned.
For more than a millennium, Christianity had managed to unite European states despite their different languages and customs.
His power, present everywhere, affected everyone, from the monarch to the plebe.
One of the most important principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds are reserved for that specific function.
The central dome of the church had remained in Rome for more than a millennium and this concentration of power and money caused many to wonder whether this principle was being respected.
Within a short time, the British began a naval blockade in Germany.
While the strategy, which involved the interruption of vital military and civilian supplies, was successful, this measure violated international law generally recognized and contemplated in several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Great Britain extracted international waters in full ocean sectors to block the entry of ships, putting even neutral vessels at risk.
Having received a reduced response against this tactic, Germany was thinking of a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine war.
Throughout the 1920s, the attitude adopted by most citizens and nations was that of pacifism and isolation.
After the horrors and atrocities that occurred during World War I, countries wanted to prevent such a situation from happening in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job at the Edison company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents, a poem book and a recommendation note made by Charles Batchelor (his manager in his last job) and directed to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of delimiting the different periods of time. Each stage or family in power constituted a different dynasty.
Among each dynasty, there was also a period of instability, with divided provinces. The best known was that of the Three Kingdoms, which developed over 60 years, between the Hhan dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
During these stages, a bloody war was unleashed among many nobles who disputed the throne.
One of the bloodiest periods in the history of Antigua China was that of The Three Kingdoms, where thousands of people died in a struggle to occupy the throne of the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many of its political and social consequences, such as the use of the metric system, the movement of absolutism towards republicanism, nationalism and the conviction that the country belongs to the people, not to just one sovereign.
Also, after the Revolution, the posts were open to all male candidates, which enabled the most ambitious and prestigious candidates to succeed.
The same is true of the military, as, instead of basing the army's positions in classes, they are now based on the calibre.
The French Revolution was also a source of inspiration for many other people of the repressed working class in other countries to face their own revolutions.
Mahoma was deeply interested in issues beyond this worldly life. He used to visit a cave that became known as "Hira" in the mountain of "Noor" (light) to reflect.
The cave itself, which lasted in time, illustrates in a very realistic way the spiritual inclinations of Muhammad.
In the cusp of one of the mountains north of La Mecca, lies a totally abstract cave of the rest of the planet.
In fact, it is very difficult to find, even if one is sure of its existence. Inside the cave, the isolation is total.
Nothing can see more than the wonderful clear sky and the numerous mountains around it. From the inside of this cave, you can see or hear very little of this world.
Of the seven wonders, the only one that follows is the Great Pyramid of Guiza.
The Great Pyramid, raised by the Egyptian people in the third century B.C., is one of the many pyramidal and large structures built to venerate the deceased Pharaoh.
The Meseta de Guiza, or “Necropolis de Guiza”, in the Valley of the Dead, in Egypt, contains numerous pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest one), several small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many others of this kind, smaller tombs and temples rose in honor of their wives and relatives.
The ‘arch upwards’ mark is similar to a V and the ‘arch down’ mark is similar to a staple or a square without its lower edge.
Above means that you must start on the tip and push the bow, and down means you must start on the frog, where the hand holds the bow, and pull it out of it.
The ascending movement of the arc generates a smoother sound, while a descending one is stronger and tating.
Feel free to make your own brands with pencil, but do not forget that brands in bow instruments have been printed in that place for a musical purpose and should therefore be respected.
On 6 October 1789, a crowd of market women forced the terrified monarch Luis XVI, Maria Antonieta, her two small children (Maria Teresa, 11 years old and Luis Carlos, four years old) and the sister of the King, Madam Elizabeth, to return to Paris from Versailles.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd that screamed and launched threats against the king and the queen.
The crowd forced the king and the queen to open the windows of her chariot completely.
At one point, a participant of the revolt shook the head of a royal guard executed in Versailles in front of the queen, who was panicking.
The Filipino people themselves paid for the war expenses of US imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime in order to solve most of the expenses and interests of the bonds that fluctuated on behalf of the Philippine government in the Wall Street banks.
Since then, the super-gains derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Philippine people would constitute the main gains of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars it is necessary to understand the context that gave rise to the establishment of order.
The European historical period in which these events are situated is commonly known as the High Middle Ages, between the 11th, XII and XIII centuries (i.e. between 1000 and 1300 AD).
The Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which, by convention, ended about 1500.
Technological determinism is a concept that pragmatically understands a great range of ideas, from the impulse or technological imperative to a strict sense that there is a underlying logic that drives the destiny of humanity and relates to the laws of science and how they are shaped in technology.
Almost all the interpretations of technological determinism have in common two general ideas: that technological development itself unfolds along a path independent of any cultural or political influence and that, at the same time, technology has “effects” in societies that are inherent and not socially conditioned.
To give an example, one might argue that the existence of automobiles necessarily results in the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a small volume of cars, with which new manufacturing techniques are being designed to reduce the costs of owning a vehicle.
Massive use of automobiles also results in a greater impact on traffic accidents, leading to the development of new techniques in the field of health to repair damaged bodies.
The element of cultural determinism was very present in romance, according to scholars such as Goether, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography molded people and, over time, customs and cultures related to that geography developed, which, in keeping with the location of that society, were preferable to laws which were arbitrarily imposed.
As Paris is known as the city of fashion today, Constantinople was considered such in feudal Europe.
His fame of being an epicenter of luxury began in approximately 400 B.C. and spread to approximately 1100 A.D.
During the 12th century its status declined, especially because, on their return, the Crusaders brought gifts, such as silks and spices, to which they were valued more than the goods offered in the Byzantine markets.
The title of "Modern Capital" was transferred from Constantinople to Paris from then on.
The gothic-style cusp took place in the period between the X-XI and the XIV centuries.
At first, the way of dressing received great influence from Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slowness of communication channels, Western styles could delay between 25 and 30 years.
Toward the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant advances at that time was that, product of the Crusades, people began using buttons to open their garments.
Subsistence agriculture is meant to produce enough food to cater exclusively for the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, generally organic practice that combines the use of stored seeds originating in the ecological region with crop rotation or other comparatively simple methods to maximize production.
Historically, much of the main activity of farmers was subsistence agriculture, which is still being practiced in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals with similar ideas and feelings of marginalization by social standards and give them the possibility to generate a sense of identity.
There are many factors that can distinguish subcultures: age, ethnicity, class, location or gender of their members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, sexual, geographical or related to religion or politics, or a mixture of factors.
It is common for the members of a subculture to display features of their belonging to it by using the distinctive and symbolic use of the style, such as fashion, gestures and jersey.
One of the most commonly used mechanisms to graph the importance of socializing is to analyze the few and regrettable cases of children who, through negligence, misfortune or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults during their growth.
These children are called "salvations". Some wild children are confined by people, in general their parents. In some cases, the abandonment of a child is due to the rejection of parents to the serious intellectual or physical disability of the child.
Wild children may have suffered traumatic situations or severe child abuse before being abandoned or fled.
It is said that others were raised by animals and that some have lived on their own in the wild.
When the wild child is raised exclusively by animals other than humans, it presents behaviors (within its physical possibilities) almost equal to that of the specific animal that cared for it, as well as its fear or indifference toward people.
Even though project-based learning should facilitate that process and make it more interesting, walking goes a little further.
Walking is not a learning technique; it is, rather, assistance that provides support to those experiencing a new experience, such as the use of a new computer program or the start of a new project.
The scaffolding can be presented in both real and virtual format; to say otherwise, a teacher is a type of scaffolding, but it is also the small animated subjectapapeles of Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is incorporated into the software and its function is to question, stimulate or explain procedures that may have resulted in complex results for the student alone.
Children in foster care are welcomed for a wide range of reasons, from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment in which he has no affection, care and education; but he does.
We can perceive that the family hosting system provides a safe area for these children.
The aim of our foster care system is to provide safe homes, loving guardians, sustained education and reliable medical assistance.
The aim of family care is to meet all needs that were not met in the home from which they were previously collected.
The Internet combines and combines components of mass communication and between people.
The different features that the Internet presents open up to new dimensions from the perspective of the concept of use and rewards.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are indicated as significant incentives for Internet use (James et al. 1995).
During a study of user reactions to websites led by Eighmey and McCord (1998), “personal participation” and “durable relationships” were also identified as new motivational factors.
Through video recording, important findings have occurred in the interpretation of mycorexions, which are movements in the face of only a few milliseconds of duration.
Specifically, it is argued that, through the proper reading of their microexpressions, it is possible to detect whether a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The president's speech, explained how those who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can, however, accurately evaluate sincerity.
It even suggests that ability to interpret human behavior can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
Through the research work of the 20th century it has been shown that there are two groups of genetic variation: the occult and the manifesto.
The mutation process incorporates a new genetic variation; the selection process removes it from that set of variations.
Segregation and recombination differ between one and another generation after generation.
In the savanna, it is not easy for a primate, whose digestive system is equal to human, to meet its amino acid needs with the plant resources available to it.
Furthermore, not to do so poses serious problems: slowing growth, malnutrition and, ultimately, death.
Proteins present in leaves and vegetables had been the source of plant resources of the simplest access, but they are not easily digestible for primates like us, except that they are cooked.
On the other hand, animal-derived foods (hormies, termites, eggs) are easy to digest while providing a large number of proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
In short, it should not surprise us if our own predecessors resolved their "protein problems" in the same way as the chimpanzees of the savanna today.
The sleep interruption consists of intentionally waking up during the normal sleep period and sleeping after a while (10 to 60 minutes).
This can easily be achieved with a more or less smooth alarm clock that makes it back to a conscious state, even without giving it a full awakening.
Registration is an additional requirement for the visa process. In some countries, you will have to register your presence and address your accommodation with local authorities.
Other options based on biological rhythm consist of drinking a lot of fluid (especially water or tea, known as diuretic) before sleeping, which will force you to rise to urinate.
The level of inner peace a person enjoys is linked in an opposite way to the amount of tension in his or her body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the strength of the life we count with. Each of us has the potential to find absolute peace and peace.
All we can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that hinders the path is our tension and negativity.
While the foundations of Tibetan Buddhism are Buddha's teachings, they spread through the path of Mahayana love and numerous techniques of Indian yoga.
In general terms, laism is very simple. It is based on kundalini yoga, meditation and the way of love that all encompasses.
In Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (lighting) is activated with yoga positions, breathing practices, mantras or visualizations.
Tibetan meditation focuses on the Devata Yoga. Through the visualization of different deities, energy channels can be hampered, chakras are activated and the awareness of enlightenment is developed.
Cooperation between the USSR and the United States was the result of a common enemy, Germany, during the Second World War. After the end of the war, the system, process and culture collisions ended up distancing the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, those who were now allies were enemies and the Cold War began.
It would extend for the next 40 years and would be effectively combated, through substitute militias, in battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, among many other sites.
Because by 17 September 1939 the Polish defence was already broken, its only hope was to withdraw and reorganise itself in the extension of the Romanian bridge head.
However, these plans fell into disuse almost one day, when more than 800 000 fighters from the Soviet Union Red Army entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international, bilateral and multilateral agreements.
Using ships to transport goods is a much more effective way of moving large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
The role of the navy has always been to ensure that its country retains the power to move its population and goods, while at the same time interfering with the enemy's ability to do the same.
The North Atlantic campaign in World War II provides one of the most clear and recent examples of this. Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic to support Britain.
At the same time, the German army, mainly employing submersibles, tried to nullify this movement.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany could have taken power in Britain, as it did with the other European countries.
It seems that goats were first domesticated about 10 000 years ago in the Zagro Mountains in Iran.
In order to easily obtain their milk, hair, meat and leather, the ancient peoples and tribes began to stay with them.
In general, domestic goats were gathered in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often cared for by herders of goats who used to be children or adolescents, similar to the most popular shepherd. These methods of shepherding are still being used today.
In England, the railways had already settled into the 16th century.
Even though the rails of the carts were made of simple parallel wooden tables, they allowed the horses that were bouncing them to achieve a higher speed and drag heavier loads than on the roads a little more scabrous of the day.
The incorporation of sleepers to keep the rieles in place occurred quite early. However, gradually, they realized that the rieles would be more efficient if they were coated with iron at their top.
This turned into a normal practice, although iron caused greater wear on the wheels of the wagons, made of wood.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced with other made of iron and, in 1767, solid iron rails began to be used.
The first form of transport that was known was walking. The human being began to do so in a raised position two million years ago with the appearance of the Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, had no habit of walking upright.
Although bipedestation traces have been found in Australian fossils of 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs seven million years ago.
We can begin to live a more friendly life with the planet, become part of environmental movements, or even become activists and struggle to lessen, to some extent, future suffering.
It is, in many cases, like asymptomatic treatment, but if not only a temporary situation is sought, we should find the root of the problems and try to disable them.
It is evident that the world has undergone major changes, resulting from the technological and scientific advances of mankind, and the problems have intensified because of the overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle of people.
After being approved by Congress on 4 July, a handwritten draft was sent and signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson to John Dunlap's printer, a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as the Dunlap Copies.
It was John Nixon who first read the document and did it in the courtyard of the Independence Hall on July 8.
On 6 July, a copy was sent to George Washington, who ordered her to be read to his army in New York on 9 July. On 10 August, another copy was sent to London.
The 25 photographs of Dunlap, which are known to exist, are the oldest preserved copies of the document. The original manuscript has been lost.
A large number of paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today. They are birds.
Many people do not represent them as dinosaurs, as they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are many characteristics in birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
They have squalid extremities and with claws, they lay eggs and move on their hind legs as well as the T-Rex.
Currently, almost all computers operate on the basis of the manipulation of data encoded under the binary system.
A binary number can only have one of two values, they are 0 and 1 and, according to the computer jar, these numbers are known as binary digits, or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be shown immediately. Her symptoms, such as vomiting, are too common to give an immediate diagnosis.
The most clear indicator of internal poisoning can be found with an open bottle of toxic chemicals or chemical cleaning products.
Read the label for specific information on the first aid relevant to that specific poison.
Entomologists use the parasite insect term in a formal sense to refer to this group of arthropods.
The word comes from its ancient relationship with the chinches, a species very developed to parasitize humans.
The killer chinches and bed ones are nestled; they are adapted to inhabit the nest or home of their host.
The registered cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the U.S. amount to about 400,000, making it the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
The central nervous system, brain union, spinal cord and optic nerve is the object of attack of multiple sclerosis.
The studies indicated that women have twice the probability that men suffer from MS.
A couple might conclude that raising a baby would not be most convenient for them or for the child.
These couples could choose to plan for the adoption of a baby.
In adoption, biological parents waive their parental rights so that a different couple can take care of the child.
The ultimate objective of science is to decipher the way the world works through the scientific method. Indeed, this method serves as a guide for most scientific research.
However, this is not an experiment, it is a test that is used to rule out one or more of the possible hypotheses, by asking questions and observations that guide scientific research.
The focus of both naturalists and philosophers was placed in classical works; especially in the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's thoughts, especially the questions of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As the rule of the Greek language declined, the West distanced itself from its Greek roots, both philosophical and scientific.
Often, many rhythms present in physiological processes and behavior depend decisively on internal cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not only reactions to regular external stimuli, have been recorded in almost all living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustained and have a period of free cyclical operation, even if there are no external stimuli.
One of the key indicators that DNA consisted of a genetic material was the experiment conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase inserted their own DNA into a bacteria using beans, or viruses.
They conducted two experiments in which they marked the DNA of the beam with radioactive phosphorus or DNA protein with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the slice of affected genetic material and whether it involves germ cells, the mutation may have various effects.
Only germ cell mutations can be transmitted to children, while those occurring elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism often attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, which includes wildlife and vegetation.
Examples of possible activities at the site are: hunting, fishing, photography, bird sighting and park visits, and ecosystem information study.
One example is to visit, take pictures and learn about the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in their cars to go to their jobs and often cross with others whose jobs are in the place they have just left.
In this dynamic transfer launcher, everyone is somehow connected with a transport system based on the use of private cars, and they support it.
Currently, scientists argue that this massive carbon economy has deprived the biosphere of one of its regular states that has contributed to the evolution of mankind for the past two million years.
They are all part of society and make use of transport systems; and almost all of them complain about them.
In developed countries, it is uncommon to hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or the collapse of bridges.
What is the reason for transport systems giving rise to complaints of such a caliber and why are there faults on a daily basis? Are transport engineers simply incapable? Or is there something more substantial that is happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the individual movement of drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, it is not a simple task to study the flow of traffic, as it is not possible to make accurate predictions about the behavior of drivers.
Fortunately, there is a tendency for drivers to maintain relatively consistent behaviour, allowing traffic flows to have logical consistency and may be subject to approximate mathematical representation.
In order to better graph the flow of circulation, relationships were established between the three most important elements: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
Such relations facilitate both the planning and design and the operations of road devices.
The first species to fly were insects. This helped them escape their enemies more easily and to find food and couple more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to bend the wings back, pasting them to the sides of the body.
This gives you a larger range of possible small places to hide from predators.
Currently, anisopters and efemeropters are the only insects unable to bend their wings.
Thousands ago, a man named Aristarchus commented that the solar system revolved around the sun.
There were those who shared their theory, but many others believed the opposite: that the solar system orbited the Earth, even the Sun and other stars.
This seems to make sense, since your movement is not perceived on Earth, right?
The Amazonas River is the most caudal and the second largest of the planet. It contains 8 times more water than the river that follows it in size.
In addition, the Amazonas is the largest river on the planet, at some points with an amplitude of up to six miles.
Of the total water coming from the rivers of the world that flows into the oceans, 20 percent comes from the Amazon.
The large Amazon River has an extension of 6387 km (3980 miles) and receives water of thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, it could never be overcome by those of Guiza, in size or in the sublime technique of its building.
The ancient Egyptian people of the New Empire were amazed by the monuments of their ancestors, who then dated more than a millennium.
With approximately 800 inhabitants, the Vatican City is the smallest independent country in the world and the smallest population.
The Italian is used in Vatican City, both to draft its rules and to issue its official communiqués.
The language that speaks daily the majority of those who work in the state is also Italian and the use of Latin is generally reserved for religious ceremonies.
All citizens living in Vatican City subscribe to Roman Catholic religion.
The basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper are known from ancient times, since all of them can be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with rudimentary tools.
The philosopher Aristotle developed the theory that everything is formed by a combination of one or more of four elements: land, water, air and fire.
This kept greater similarity with the states of matter (with identical order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, only at the same time had the theory that they become new substances that make up the things we see.
The alloys are basically a combination of two or more metals. Remember that the periodic table has many elements.
Metals are considered to be elements such as calcium and potassium. Since then, there are also metals of the type of gold and silver.
There may also be alloys with small amounts of elements, such as carbon, which are not metallic.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter, consisting of small particles called atoms.
The size of the atoms is so impressively small that the end point of this prayer could contain billions of them.
So when it was invented, the pencil won many friends.
Unfortunately, as a result of the implementation of new writing methods, the pencil is used less and has lost its status.
Nowadays, people write messages on their computer screens. They don't even need to get close to a clipboard.
We just have to ask ourselves what will be on the keyboard when something newer comes up.
The atomic pump operates on the basis of the principle that energy is required to form a nucleus with a large amount of protons and neutrons.
It's similar to what happens when you roll a heavy chariot up a hill. By dividing the nucleus once again, it releases some of that energy.
The nuclei of some atoms are unstable, that is, they tend to break down with a minimum or almost no push.
The surface of the moon consists of rocks and dust and its outer layer is called bark.
The bark has a thickness of about 70 km on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more seas on the near side because its bark is thinner, which made it easier for the lava to ascend to the surface.
Content theories focus on looking for what attracts or likes people.
These doctrines claim that people have certain needs or desires that have been internalized as they grew to maturity.
These theories analyze what causes certain people to want the things they do and what factors in their environment force them to do or not do certain things.
Two well-known theories are that of the hierarchy of needs, of Maslow, and of the two factors, of Hertzberg.
In general, two types of behavior can occur when managers begin to lead their former companions. On one side of the spectrum, is the attempt to continue being "one of the boys" (or girls).
It is difficult for managers of this category to make decisions against employees, impose disciplinary measures, carry out performance assessments, assign responsibilities and require accountability to staff.
At the other end of the spectrum, it moves into an unrecognizable person who believes it is necessary to modify everything that has so far been doing the group and doing it in its own way.
In the end, the ultimate responsibility for the success and failure of the team is the leader.
This way of behavior often ends up distanceing the leaders of the other team members.
The same standards of excellence that conventional equipment handles apply to virtuals, although there are small differences.
Often, members of a virtual team operate as a point of contact for their closest physical group.
Generally, they enjoy greater autonomy than members of a traditional group, thanks to the fact that it is possible for their teams to meet in accordance with different time zones which, for example, could not be understood by local management.
The existence of a real ‘invisible equipment’ (Larson and LaFasto, 1989 p. 109) is also an exclusive element of virtual equipment.
The ‘invisible team’ is the management group and to which each member reports; it sets the standards for each member.
What reason could an organization have to submit to the applicant's process of establishing a learning organization? One of the purposes of applying the theoretical concepts of organizational learning is to foster innovation.
When all available resources are used properly in the operational departments of an organization, space is generated for creativity and engineering.
As a result, the process of an organization that works as a team to overcome a difficulty of place to a new innovative process in order to meet the needs of customers.
For an organization to be innovative, leadership must first generate a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide factual evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research, thus reducing the field of research and giving it greater accuracy.
The correlation between brain pathology and conduct contributes to the research of scientists.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in mental functions.
Thanks to the height of new technologies, we have the possibility to see and investigate structures and processes that occur in the brain that have never been seen before.
This provides us with abundant information and material to develop simulation models, which favor our understanding of mental processes.
While artificial intelligence is closely associated with science fiction, it is a specialty of great relevance within computer science, which handles behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in the field of AI involves the development of machines in order to automate tasks that require intelligent behaviour.
Examples of this include monitoring, planning and programming, the ability to respond to clients' diagnoses and consultations, as well as facial recognition, writing, voice recognition.
These issues have become separate disciplines, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The Artificial Intelligence system is now often used in the sectors of the economy, medicine, engineering and militia, just as it was incorporated into various video game software applications and personal computers.
Study trips are an important part of all classrooms. It is very common for a teacher to want to take her students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
The solution comes from the hand of technology, through virtual excursions. Students can observe the objects displayed in a museum, visit an aquarium or contemplate beautiful works of art sitting with their class.
Sharing a tour in virtual form is also an excellent way to reflect on a departure and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, Bennet school students in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital and every year the page is updated, but the previous versions that in the form of the memory album are kept online.
Blogs can also help improve the writing of students. Even when students often start their blog experience with uncaressed grammar and spelling, this usually changes in the presence of an audience.
Because students tend to be the most critical readers, the blog writer begins to strive to improve his writing, in order to avoid criticism.
The blog also demands that students be more understanding of the world than it surrounds them. The need to revive the interest of the audience inspires them to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a resource that inspires collaboration and encourages students to deepen their learning beyond the typical school day.
The proper use of blogs "can empower students to be more analytical and critical, through the active response to internet content, they can define their positions in the context of the writings of others, in addition to establishing their perspectives on specific topics" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's captivated bilingual capital and has a variety of museums and art galleries that exhibit the country's history and current.
The Niagara cataracts are more south and the north is home to the unexploded natural beauty of Muskoka and the extension that follows it.
All these aspects, among others, are those that highlight Ontario as intrinsically Canadian in the eyes of foreigners.
The largest areas to the north are sparsely populated and some are wild, almost uninhabited lands.
To make a population comparison that causes great surprise to many: in the United States, they live more African Americans than Canadians.
The islands of East Africa are located on the east coast of that continent, in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is, by far, the largest and a continent in itself if we speak of wild life.
Most of the smaller islands constitute independent states or associated with France and are popular for their beaches and luxury tourist complexes.
Islam was also taken to the lands by the Arabs and imposed, to a good extent, on the Comoros and Mayotte.
The initial tip of European influence and colonialism took place in the 15th century, following the discovery, by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama, of the route that links the Cape of Europe with India.
The region limits with the Sahel to the north, and with the Atlantic Ocean to the south and to the west.
Women: All female visitors are advised to be married, regardless of their real marital status.
It will also be useful to use a ring (just look for that does not light too expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences can cause what they consider to be harassment, and that it is not uncommon for them to be followed, taken by the arm, etc.
Be it round when rejecting men and not the theme to defend their position (there are cultural differences or not, that is not right!).
The founders of the modern city of Casablanca were the Berber fishermen during the Xth century B.C. and the Phoenicians, Romans and Mernidas used it as a strategic port, called Anfa.
It was destroyed and rebuilt by the Portuguese under the name White House, but in 1755 it was abandoned after an earthquake occurred.
The city was rebuilt by order of the Moroccan sultan with the name of Daru l-Badya and the Spanish traders who installed their businesses in that place called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most boring places in all Morocco to go shopping.
Around the old Medina, there are plenty of places where traditional Moroccan items are sold, such as clay pots, ceramics, leather products, water pipes and a whole range of bagatelas, although everything is prepared for tourists.
Goma is a tourist point in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, on the eastern border, near Rwanda.
In 2002, the Nyiragongo volcano lava destroyed Goma and left much of its submerged streets, especially in the city centre.
While Goma is quite secure, any visit abroad should be considered in order to be aware of the situation of the clashes that persist in the northern Kivu province.
In turn, the city is the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and its mountain gorilla sighting tours are the cheapest in Africa.
To move into Goma, you can choose to take a wedding wedding (mototaxi). The regular (local) rate is CDF500 (Congolese francs) for a short trip.
In addition to being relatively inaccessible, it has given Tombutu an image of exotic and distant land.
Although today Tombuktu is a impoverished city, it still has an airport and its reputation makes it an attractive tourist.
In 1990, it was incorporated into the list of sites of mankind's heritage at risk, a product of the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the most important stops of the special wonder of the African world, by Henry Louis Gates, in PBS.
The city contrasts much with the rest of the country, as it has a more Arab style than African.
The Kruger National Park (PNK) is located in north-eastern South Africa and extends along the border with Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north and the Crocodile River in the south.
The park has a surface area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, in each of which a different wild life is developed.
This is one of South Africa's most important attractions and is recognized as the main icon of South Africa's National Parks (SANParks).
As in all South Africa's natural reserves, there are daily rates for conservation and access to the park.
It may also be convenient to buy a Wild Card that allows entry to select parks in South Africa or all National Parks of the country.
Hong Kong territory takes the name of the homonymous island, which is the destination most tourists consider the main attraction.
The deployment of buildings delimiting the Hong Kong horizon has been compared with a light bar graph that is evidenced by the presence of the waters of Puerto Victoria.
The way to enjoy the best views of Hong Kong is to get off the island and head to the Kowloon River, located in front.
It is in the recovered land of the North Coast of Hong Kong where its urban development is concentrated, densely.
This is the site that the British conquerors adopted as their own. Therefore, if you want to see evidence of the colonial past of this region, it is a convenient place to start.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest coastal mangrove chain, with a length of 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
UNESCO has declared the Sundarbans humanity's heritage. The forest section within the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
Without prejudice to this, forests are not only mangroves, but possess some of the last trees left from the imposing jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans comprises an area of 3850 km2 and about a third of its extension is covered by water or marshy areas.
The Sundarbans have been, since 1966, a temple of wild life and it is estimated that there are currently 400 real Bengal tigers in the area and some 30,000 moted deer.
The buses leave the station between districts (on the other side of the river) all day, though most, especially those traveling east and Jakar (also called Bumthang), leave between 6:30 and 7:30 a.m.
Because buses between districts are often full of passengers, it is advisable to purchase a ticket with a few days' advance.
Almost all districts have the Japanese Coaster bus service, which are comfortable and durable.
Sharing a taxi trip is an agile and comfortable way to move to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrums) and Punakha (200 ngultrums).
The bridge of the Oyapock River is an attractive structure that crosses it, connecting Oiapoque, Brazilian city, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, in French Guyana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 m, with a length of 378 m and two lanes of 3.5 m wide.
Under the bridge there is a 15-metre free space and, although its construction was completed in August 2011, it was not enabled for transit until March 2017.
The full operation of the bridge is estimated for September 2017, which is for when the Brazilian customs controls are expected to be completed.
The area currently located in eastern Paraguay was inhabited by the Guarani, who were the most important indigenous group in that region and who lived as seminomised hunters, as well as practicing subsistence agriculture.
The region hosted other Aboriginal groups, such as the Guaycuru and Payaguá, who were hunting, collecting and fishing as a means of subsistence.
Paraguay, formerly known as "The Giant Province of India", was born in the 16th century, as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and indigenous peoples.
The Spaniards began the phase of colonization, which extended for three centuries.
Since Asunción was established, in 1537, Paraguay has been able to preserve much of its idiosyncrasy and Aboriginal identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best teams and the best pole players worldwide.
The most important tournament of the year takes place in December in the pole fields of Las Caníitas.
Other tournaments and lower matches can also be seen in other parts of the year.
At the Argentinian Polo Association website you will get information about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches.
The value of the Malvinas pound (FKP), the official currency of the Malvinas Islands, is fixed in equivalence with the British (GBP).
There is only one bank on the islands. There you can change your money. It's in front of the FIC West store in Stanley.
Pounds are usually accepted anywhere inside the islands. In Stanley, you can also pay with credit cards or US dollars.
There are chances that credit cards will not be accepted on the islands of the periphery, but they could use British or American money. Ask the owners in advance so they can define the method of payment accepted.
It is virtually impossible to exchange money from the Malvinas Islands outside the archipelago, so try to do so before leaving.
Because Montevideo is located in southern Ecuador, there is summer when in the northern hemisphere it is winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropicals, with temperatures exceeding +30°C during the summer.
Winter cold can be deceptive: although it is very rare that temperatures are below the freezing point, wind and humidity interact to make it feel colder than the thermometer points.
There are no specifically ‘light’ or ‘dry’ seasons; the amount of rain remains almost the same throughout the year.
While many animals in the park are used to seeing people, wild life does not cease to be wild, so there is no need to feed or disturb them.
According to the park authorities, at least 100 yards/metres of distance from bears and wolves and 25 yards/metres of the rest of wild animals should be kept.
Without prejudice to how meek they can see, it is true that the bison, the uapatites, the alcoves, the bears and almost all the big animals can be aggressive.
Tens of visitors suffer injuries each year because they do not maintain an adequate distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially wild; therefore, respect their space.
Also, remember that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so you should avoid having or cooking foods that release a lot of aroma and keep the camp clean.
The capital of Samoa, the city of Apia is located on the island of Upolu and has just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, the port was the scene of a disastrous naval confrontation when seven German, American and English ships refused to leave the port.
All the boats, except for a British cruiser, killed about two hundred American and German individuals.
During the war for independence in the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the city had as its balance the murder of the head of state Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are a large number of beaches, because Auckland has two ports. The best known are in three areas.
In the North Harbour district, in the Pacific Ocean, the beaches of North Shore are located from Long Bay, in the north, to Devonport, in the south.
The beaches are almost all sand with safe places to swim and most of them have pohutukawa trees that offer shade places.
In the port of Waitemataas the beaches of Tamaki Drive, in the extravagant neighborhoods of Mission Bay and St Heliers, in the central Auckland region.
These are family beaches, sometimes very crowded, with numerous and varied shops available about the thing. They are also safe to swim.
Number One is the most popular local beer and is not complex, but rather pleasant and refreshing. The other regional beer is the Manta.
While there is a wide variety of French wines, those from New Zealand and Australia could be considered better for transport.
The local tap water is completely safe for consumption, but, if you are concerned, you can easily find water in bottle.
Australians consider foreign the notion of "flat white coffee". A black boy coffee is called "espresso", cappuccino is served with cream (instead of foam) and tea is not taken with milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but delicious.
There are numerous trips to the reef throughout the year and, there, wounds for any of these causes are rare.
In any event, accept the advice of the authorities, respect all signs and pay special attention to security alerts.
The cubodusas are located near the beaches and estuaries of the rivers from October to April, north of 1770. Sometimes they can be found outside this time.
Sharks do exist, but they almost never attack people. Most of them fear them and will swim away.
The ocean is not the place where saltwater crocodiles reside actively. Its primary habitat is the estuaries of the rivers that are located north of Rockhampton.
The accommodation reservation in advance of the trip gives you the peace of mind that you will have a place to sleep when you arrive at your destination.
Travel agents usually have agreements with specific hotels, although through them it is also possible to book another type of accommodation, such as camping areas.
Travel agents usually offer packages including breakfast, transfers from and to the airport, and even combined packages of flights and accommodation.
They can also save you the reservation in case you need time to think about the offer, or to get other documents for your destination (such as visa).
However, any change or request must be made through the travel agent in the first place, not directly through the hotel.
